# Pydistinto

**The Pydistinto is a Python implementation of different measures of distinctiveness for contrastive text analysis.**

## What is the purpose?

To facilitate the use of relevant measures that can be used for contrastive text analysis, we are developing a tool written in Python called `Pydistinto` as part of the "Zeta and Company" project. The goal of our project is to achieve a deeper understanding of the different measures of distinctiveness and to propose improvements for their implementation and use. For this purpose, we created a conceptual framework of different measures of distinctiveness and Pydistinto.
