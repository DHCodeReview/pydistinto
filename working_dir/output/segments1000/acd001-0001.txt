compensation for the trial upon my patience during the first week or so we have no caller and have begin to think that my companion be as friendless man as be myself presently however find that he have many acquaintance and those in the most different class of society there be one little sallow rat face dark eyed fellow who be introduce to i as mr. lestrade and who come three or four time in single week one morning young girl call fashionably dressed and stay for half an hour or more the same afternoon bring grey headed seedy visitor look like jew pedlar who appear to i to be much excited

inconvenience have to use this room as place of business he say and these people be my client again have an opportunity of ask he point blank question and again my delicacy prevent i from force another man to confide in i imagine at the time that he have some strong reason for not allude to it but he soon dispel the idea by come round to the subject of his own accord it be upon the 4th of march as have good reason to remember that rise somewhat early than usual and find that sherlock holmes have not yet finish his breakfast the landlady have become so accustomed to my late habit that my place have not be lay nor my coffee prepare with the unreasonable petulance of mankind ring the bell and give curt intimation that be ready then pick up magazine from the table and attempt to while

book of life and it attempt to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that come in his way it strike i as be remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity the reasoning be close and intense but the deduction appear to i to be far fetched and exaggerated the writer claim by momentary expression twitch of muscle or glance of an eye to fathom man 's inmost thought deceit accord to he be an impossibility in the case of one train to observation and analysis his conclusion be as infallible as so many proposition of euclid so startling would his result appear to the uninitiated that until they learn the process by which he have arrive at they they might well consider he as necromancer "from drop of water say the writer logician could infer the possibility of an atlantic or niagara without having see or hear of one or the other so all life be great chain the nature of which be know whenever we be show single link of it like all other art the science of deduction and analysis be one which can only be acquire by long and patient study nor be life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the high possible perfection in it before turn to those moral and mental aspect of the matter which present the great difficulty let the enquirer begin by master more elementary problem let he on meet fellow mortal learn at glance to distinguish the history of the man and the trade or profession to which he belong puerile as such an exercise may seem it sharpen the faculty of observation and teach one where to look and what to look for by man 's finger nail by his coat sleeve by his boot by his trouser knee by the callosity of his forefinger and thumb by his expression by his shirt cuff by each of these thing man 's calling be plainly reveal that all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case be almost inconceivable ""what ineffable twaddle cry slap the magazine down on the table never read such rubbish in my life ""what be it ask sherlock holmes "why this article say point at it with my egg spoon as sit down to my breakfast see that you have read it since you have mark it do n't deny that it be smartly write it irritate i though it be evidently the theory of some arm chair lounger who evolve all these neat little paradox in the seclusion of his own study it be not practical should like to see he clap down in third class carriage on the underground and ask to give the trade of all his fellow traveller would lay thousand to one against he ""you would lose your money sherlock holmes remark calmly as for the article write it myself ""you!""yes have turn both for observation and for deduction the theory which have express there and which appear to you to be so chimerical be really extremely practical so practical that depend upon they for my bread and cheese ""and how ask involuntarily "well have trade of my own suppose be the only one in the world be consulting detective if you can understand what that be here in london we have lot of government detective and lot of private one when these fellow be at fault they come to i and manage to put they on the right scent they

detail of thousand at your finger end it be odd if you ca n't unravel the thousand and first lestrade be well know detective he get himself into fog recently over forgery case and that be what bring he here ""and these other people?""they be mostly send on by private inquiry agency they be all people who be in trouble about something and want little enlightening listen to their story they listen to my comment and then pocket my fee ""but do you mean to say say that without leave your room you can unravel some knot which other man can make nothing of although they have see every detail for themselves?""quite so have kind of intuition that way now and again case turn up which be little more complex then have to bustle about and see thing with my own eye you see have lot of special knowledge which apply to the problem and which facilitate matter wonderfully those rule of deduction lay down in that article which arouse your scorn be invaluable to i in practical work observation with i be second nature you appear to be surprised when tell you on our first meeting that you have come from afghanistan ""you be tell no doubt ""nothing of the sort iknewyou come from afghanistan from long habit the train of thought run so swiftly through my mind that arrive at the conclusion without be conscious of intermediate step there be such step however the train of reasoning run here

wrist be fair he have undergo hardship and sickness as his haggard face say clearly his left arm have be injure he hold it in stiff and unnatural manner where in the tropic could an english army doctor have see much hardship and get his arm wound clearly in afghanistan the whole train of thought do not occupy second then remark that you come from afghanistan and you be astonish ""it be simple enough as you explain it say smile you remind i of edgar allen poe 's dupin have no idea that such individual do exist outside of story "sherlock holmes rise and light his pipe no doubt you think that you be compliment i in compare i to dupin he observe now in my opinion dupin be very inferior fellow that trick of his of break in on his friend thought with an apropos remark after quarter of an hour 's silence be really very showy and superficial he have some analytical genius no doubt but he be by no means such phenomenon as poe appear to imagine ""have you read gaboriau 's work ask do lecoq come up to your idea of detective?"sherlock holmes sniff sardonically lecoq be miserable bungler he say in an angry voice he have only one thing to recommend he and that be his energy that book make i positively ill the question be how to identify an unknown prisoner could have do it in twenty four hour lecoq take six month or so it might be make text book for detective to teach they what to avoid "i feel rather indignant at have two character whom have admire treat in this cavalier style walk over to the window and stand look out into the busy street this fellow may be very clever say to myself but he be certainly very conceited ""there be no crime and no criminal in these day he say querulously what be the use of have brain in our profession know well that have it in i to make my name famous no man live or have ever live who have bring the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which have do and what be the result there be no crime to detect or at most some bungle villainy with motive so transparent that even scotland yard official can see through it "i be still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation think it well to change the topic "i wonder what that fellow be look for ask point to stalwart plainly dress individual who be walk slowly down the other side of the street look anxiously at the number he have large blue envelope in his

hardly pass through my mind when the man whom we be watch catch sight of the number on our door and run rapidly across the roadway we hear loud knock deep voice below and heavy step ascend the stair "for mr. sherlock holmes he say step into the room and hand my friend the letter here be an opportunity of take the conceit out of he he little think of this when he make that random shot may ask my lad say in the bland voice what your trade may be?""commissionaire sir he say gruffly uniform away for repair ""and you be ask with slightly malicious glance at my companion "a sergeant sir royal marine light infantry sir no answer right sir "he click his heel together raise his hand in salute and be go confess that be considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion 's theory my respect for his power of analysis increase wondrously there still remain some lurk suspicion in my mind however that the whole thing be pre arranged episode intend to dazzle i though what earthly object he could have in take i in be past my comprehension when look at he he have finish read the note and his eye have assume the vacant lack lustre expression which show mental abstraction "how in the world do you deduce that ask "deduce what say he petulantly "why that he be retired sergeant of marines ""i have no time for trifle he answer brusquely then with smile excuse my rudeness you break the thread of my thought but perhaps it be as well so you actually be not able to see that that man be sergeant of marines?""no indeed ""it be easy to know it than to explain why know it if you be ask to prove that two and two make four you might find some difficulty and yet you be quite sure of the fact even across the street could see great blue anchor tattoo on the back of the fellow 's hand that smack of the sea he have military carriage however and regulation side whisker there we have the marine he be man with some amount of self importance and certain air of command you must have observe the way in which he hold his head and swing his cane steady respectable middle aged man too on the face of he all fact which lead i to believe that he have be sergeant ""wonderful ejaculate "commonplace say holmes though think from his expression that he be pleased at my evident surprise and admiration say just now that there be no criminal it appear that be wrong look at this he throw i over the note which the commissionaire have bring 7"why cry as cast my eye over it this be terrible!""it do seem to be little out of the common he remark calmly would you mind read it to i aloud?"this be the letter which read to he my dear mr sherlock holmes there have be bad business during the night at lauriston gardens off the brixton road our man on the beat see light there about two in the morning and as the house be an empty one suspect that something be amiss he find the door open and in the front room which be bare of furniture discover the body of gentleman well dressed and have card in his pocket bear the name of enoch j. drebber cleveland ohio u.s.a. there have be no robbery nor be there any evidence as to how the man meet his death there be mark of

shockingly so they have their knife into one another too they be as jealous as pair of professional beauty there will be some fun over this case if they be both put upon the scent "i be amazed at the calm way in which he ripple on surely there be not moment to be lose cry shall go and order you cab?""i'm not sure about whether shall go be the most incurably lazy devil that ever stand in shoe

may be sure that gregson lestrade and co. will pocket all the credit that come of be an unofficial personage ""but he beg you to help he ""yes he know that be his superior and acknowledge it to i but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person however we may as well go and have look shall work it out on my own hook may have laugh at they if have nothing else come on!"he hustle on his overcoat and bustle about in way that show that an energetic fit have supersede the apathetic one "get your hat he say "you wish i to come?""yes if you have nothing well to do minute later we be both in hansom drive furiously for the brixton road it be foggy cloudy morning and dun colour veil hang over the house top look like the reflection of the mud colour street beneath my companion be in the good of spirit and prattle away about cremona fiddle and the difference between stradivarius and an amati as for myself be silent for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we be engage depress my spirit "you do n't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand say at last interrupt holmes musical disquisition "no datum yet he answer it be capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence it bias the judgment ""you will have your datum soon remark point with my finger this be the brixton road and that be the house if be not very much mistaken ""so it be stop driver stop we be still hundred yard or so from it but he insist upon our alighting and we finish our journey upon foot number lauriston gardens wear an ill omened and minatory look it be one of four which stand back some little way from the street two be occupy and two empty the latter look out with three tier of vacant melancholy window which be blank and dreary save that here and there to let card have develop like cataract upon the blear pane small garden sprinkle over with scatter eruption of sickly plant separate each of these house from the street and be traverse by narrow pathway yellowish in colour and consist apparently of mixture of clay and of gravel the whole place be very sloppy from the rain which have fall through the night the garden be bound by three foot brick wall with fringe of wood rail upon the top and against this wall be lean stalwart police constable surround by small knot of loafer who crane their neck and strain their eye in the vain hope of catch some glimpse of the proceeding within have imagine that sherlock holmes would at once have hurry into the house and plunge into study of the mystery nothing appear to be far from his intention with an air of nonchalance which under the circumstance seem to i to border upon affectation he lounge up and down the pavement and gaze vacantly at the ground the sky the opposite house and the line of railing having finish his scrutiny he proceed slowly down the path or rather down the fringe of grass which flank the path keep his eye rivet upon the ground twice he stop and once see he smile and hear he utter an exclamation of satisfaction there be many mark of footstep upon the wet clayey soil but since the police have be come and go over it be unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it still have have such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculty that have no doubt that he could see great deal which be hide from i at the door of the house we be meet by tall white faced flaxen haired man with notebook in his hand who rush forward and wrung my companion 's hand with effusion it be indeed kind of you to come he say have have everything leave untouched ""except that my friend answer point at the pathway if herd of buffalo have pass along there could not be great mess no doubt however you have draw your own conclusion gregson before you permit this ""i have have so much to do inside the house the detective say evasively my colleague mr. lestrade be here have rely upon he to look after this "holme glance at i and raise his eyebrow sardonically with two such man as yourself and lestrade upon the ground there will not be much for third party to find out he say gregson rub his hand in self satisfied way think we have do all that can be do he answer it be queer case though and know your taste for such thing ""you do not come here in cab ask sherlock holmes "no sir ""nor lestrade?""no sir ""then let we go and look at the room with which inconsequent remark he stride on into the house follow by gregson whose feature express his astonishment short passage bare planked and dusty lead to the kitchen and office two door open out of it to the left and to the right one of these have obviously be close for many week the other belong to the dining room which be the apartment in which the mysterious affair have

to everything which be intensify by the thick layer of dust which coat the whole apartment all these detail observe afterwards at present my attention be centre upon the single grim motionless figure which lie stretch upon the board with vacant sightless eye stare up at the discolour ceiling it be that of man about forty three or forty four year of age middle sized broad shoulder with crisp curl black hair and short stubbly beard he be dress in heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat with light colour trouser and immaculate collar and cuff top hat well brushed and trim be place upon the floor beside he his hand be clench and his arm throw abroad while his low limb be interlock as though his death struggle have be grievous one on his rigid face there stand an expression of horror and as it seem to i of hatred such as have never see upon human feature this malignant and terrible contortion combine with the low forehead blunt nose and prognathous jaw give the dead man singularly simious and ape like appearance which be increase by his writhing unnatural posture have see death in many form but never have it appear to i in more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment which look out upon one of the main artery of suburban london lestrade lean and ferret like as ever be stand by the doorway and greet my companion and myself "this case will make stir sir he remark it beat anything have see and be no chicken ""there be no clue say gregson "none at all chime in lestrade sherlock holmes approach the body and kneel down examine it intently you be sure that there be no
