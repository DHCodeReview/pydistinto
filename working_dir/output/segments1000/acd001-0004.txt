face as ask the question her feature turn perfectly livid it be some second before she could get out the single word yes and when it do come it be in husky unnatural tone "there be silence for moment and then the daughter speak in calm clear voice "'no good can ever come of falsehood mother she say let we be frank with this gentleman wedidsee mr. drebber again '"'god forgive you cry madame charpentier throw up her hand and sink back in her chair you have murder your brother '"'arthur would rather that we speak the truth the girl answer firmly "'you have well tell i all about it now say half confidence be bad than none besides you do not know how much we know of it '"'on your head be it alice cry her mother and then turn to i will tell you all sir do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arise from any fear lest he should have have hand in this terrible affair he be utterly innocent of it my dread be however that in your eye and in the eye of other he may appear to be compromise that however be surely impossible his high character his profession his antecedent would all forbid it '"'your good way be to make clean breast of the fact answer depend upon it if your son be innocent he will be none the bad '"'perhaps alice you have well leave we together she say and her daughter withdraw now sir she continue have no intention of tell you all this but since my poor daughter have disclose it have no alternative having once decide to speak will tell you all without omit any particular '"'it be your wise course say i."'mr drebber have be with we nearly three week he and his secretary mr. stangerson have be travel on the continent notice copenhagen label upon each of their trunk show that that have be their last stopping place stangerson be quiet reserved man but his employer be sorry to say be far otherwise he be coarse in his habit and brutish in his way the very night of his arrival he become very much the bad for drink and indeed after twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be say to be sober his manner towards the maid servant be disgustingly free and familiar bad of all he speedily assume the same attitude towards my daughter alice and speak to she more than once in way which fortunately she be too innocent to understand on one occasion he actually seize she in his arm and embrace she an outrage which cause his own secretary to reproach he for his unmanly conduct '"'but why do you stand all this ask suppose that you can get rid of your boarder when you wish '"mrs charpentier blush at my pertinent question would to god that have give he notice on the very day that he come she say but it be sore temptation they be pay pound day each fourteen pound week and this be the slack season be widow and my boy in the navy have cost i much grudge to lose the money act for the good this last be too much however and give he notice to leave on account of it that be the reason of his going '"'well?'"'my heart grow light when see he drive away my son be on leave just now but do not tell he anything of all this for his temper be violent and he be passionately fond of his sister when close the door behind they load seem to be lift from my mind alas in less than an hour there be ring at the bell and learn that mr. drebber have return he be much excited and evidently the bad for drink he force his way into the room where be sit with my daughter and make some incoherent remark about having miss his train he then turn to alice and before my very face propose to she that she should fly with he you be of age he say and there be no law to stop you have money enough and to spare never mind the old girl here but come along with i now straight away you shall live like princess poor alice be so frightened that she shrink away from he but he catch she by the wrist and endeavour to draw she towards the door scream and at that moment my son arthur come into the room what happen then do not know hear oath and the confused sound of scuffle be too terrified to raise my head when do look up see arthur stand in the doorway laughing with stick in his hand do n't think that fine fellow will trouble we again he say will just go after he and see what he do with himself with those word he take his hat and start off down the street the next morning we hear of mr. drebber 's mysterious death '"this statement come from mrs. charpentier 's lip with many gasp and pause at time she speak so low that could hardly catch the word make shorthand note of all that she say however so that there should be no possibility of mistake ""it be quite exciting say sherlock holmes with yawn what happen next?""when mrs. charpentier pause the detective continue see that the whole case hang upon one point fix she with my eye in way which always find effective with woman ask she at what hour her son return "'i do not know she answer "'not know?'"'no he have latch key and he let himself in '"'after you go to bed?'"'yes '"'when do you go to bed?'"'about eleven '"'so your son be go at least two hours?'"'yes '"'possibly four or five?'"'yes '"'what be he do during that time?'"'i do not know she answer turn white to her very lip "of course after that there be nothing more to be do find out where lieutenant charpentier be take two officer with i and arrest he when touch he on the shoulder and warn he to come quietly with we he answer we as bold as brass suppose you be arrest i for be concern in the death of that scoundrel drebber he say we have say nothing to he about it so that his allude to it have most suspicious aspect ""very say holmes "he still carry the heavy stick which the mother describe he as have with he when he follow drebber it be stout oak cudgel ""what be your theory then?""well my theory be that he follow drebber as far as the brixton road when there fresh altercation arise between they in the course of which drebber receive blow from the stick in the pit of the stomach perhaps which kill he without leave any mark the night be so wet that no one be about so charpentier drag the body of his victim into the empty house as to the candle and the blood and the writing on the wall and the ring they may all be so many trick to throw the police on to the wrong scent ""well do say holmes in an encouraging voice really gregson you be get along we shall make something of you yet ""i flat myself that have manage it rather neatly the detective answer proudly the young man volunteer statement in which he say that after follow drebber some time the latter perceive he and take cab in order to get away from he on his way home he meet an old shipmate and take long walk with he on be ask where this old shipmate live he be unable to give any satisfactory reply think the whole case fit together uncommonly well what amuse i be to think of lestrade who have start off upon the wrong scent be afraid he wo n't make much of 15 why by jove here be the very man himself!"it be indeed lestrade who have ascend the stair while we be talk and who now enter the room the assurance and jauntiness which generally mark his demeanour and dress be however want his face be disturb and troubled while his clothe be disarrange and untidy he have evidently come with the intention of consult with sherlock holmes for on perceive his colleague he appear to be embarrassed and put out he stand in the centre of the room fumble nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do this be most extraordinary case he say at last most incomprehensible affair ""ah you find it so mr. lestrade cry gregson triumphantly think you would come to that conclusion have you manage to find the secretary mr. joseph stangerson?""the secretary mr. joseph stangerson say lestrade gravely be murder at halliday 's private hotel about six o'clock this morning "the intelligence with which lestrade greet we be so momentous and so unexpected that we be all three fairly dumfoundered gregson spring out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water stare in silence at sherlock holmes whose lip be compress and his brow draw down over his eye "stangerson too he mutter the plot thicken ""it be quite thick enough before grumble lestrade take chair seem to have drop into sort of council of war ""are you be you sure of this piece of intelligence stammer gregson "i have just come from his room say lestrade be the first to discover what have occur ""we have be hear gregson 's view of the matter holme observe would you mind let we know what you have see and done?""i have no objection lestrade answer seat himself freely confes that be of the opinion that stangerson be concern in the death of drebber this fresh development have show i that be completely mistaken full of the one idea set myself to find out what have become of the secretary they have be see together at euston station about half past eight on the evening of the third at two in the morning drebber have be find in the brixton road the question which confront i be to find out how stangerson have be employ between 8.30 and the time of the crime and what have become of he afterwards telegraph to liverpool give description of the man and warn they to keep watch upon the american boat then set to work call upon all the hotel and lodging house in the vicinity of euston you see argue that if drebber and his companion have become separate the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night and then to hang about the station again next morning ""they would be likely to agree on some meeting place beforehand remark holmes "so it prove spend the whole of yesterday evening in make enquiry entirely without avail this morning begin very early and at eight o'clock reach halliday 's private hotel in little george street on my enquiry as to whether mr. stangerson be live there they at once answer i in the affirmative "'no doubt you be the gentleman whom he be expect they say he have be wait for gentleman for two day '"'where be he now ask "'he be upstairs in bed he wish to be call at nine '"'i will go up and see he at once say "it seem to i that my sudden appearance might shake his nerve and lead he to say something unguarded the boots volunteer to show i the room it be on the second floor and there be small corridor lead up to it the boots point out the door to i and be about to go downstairs again when see something that make i feel sickish in spite of my twenty year experience from under the door there curl little red ribbon of blood which have meander across the passage and form little pool along the skirting at the other side give cry which bring the boots back he nearly faint when he see it the door be lock on the inside but we put our shoulder to it and knock it in the window of the room be open and beside the window all huddle up lie the body of man in his nightdress he be quite dead and have be for some time for his limb be rigid and cold when we turn he over the boots recognize he at once as be the same gentleman who have engage the room under the name of joseph stangerson the cause of death be deep stab in the left side which must have penetrate the heart and now come the strange part of the affair what do you suppose be above the murder man?"i feel creeping of the flesh and presentiment of come horror even before sherlock holmes answer "the word rache write in letter of blood he say "that be it say lestrade in an awe strike voice and we be all silent for while there be something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deed of this unknown assassin that it impart fresh ghastliness to his crime my nerve which be steady enough on the field of battle tingle as think of it "the man be see continue lestrade milk boy pass on his way to the dairy happen to walk down the lane which lead from the mews at the back of the hotel he notice that ladder which usually lie there be raise against one of the window of the second floor which be wide open after pass he look back and see man descend the ladder he come down so quietly and openly that the boy imagine he to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel he take no particular notice of he beyond think in his own mind that it be early for he to be at work he have an impression that the man be tall have reddish face and be dress in long brownish coat he must have stay in the room some little time after the murder for we find blood stain water in the basin where he have wash his hand and mark on the sheet where he have deliberately wipe his knife "i glance at holmes on hear the description of the murderer which tally so exactly with his own there be however no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face "did you find nothing in the room which could furnish clue to the murderer he ask "nothing stangerson have drebber 's purse in his pocket but it seem that this be usual as he do all the paying there be eighty odd pound in it but nothing have be take whatever the motive of these extraordinary crime robbery be certainly not one of they there be no paper or memoranda in the murder man 's pocket except single telegram date from cleveland about month ago and contain the word j. h. be in europe there be no name append to this message ""and there be nothing else holmes ask "nothing of any importance the man 's novel with which he have read himself to sleep be lie upon the bed and his pipe be on chair beside he there be glass of water on the table and on the window sill small chip ointment box contain couple of pill "sherlock holme spring from his chair with an exclamation of delight "the last link he cry exultantly my case be complete "the two detective stare at he in amazement "i have now in my hand my companion say confidently all the thread which have form such tangle there be of course detail to be fill in but be as certain of all the main fact from the time that drebber part from stangerson at the station up to the discovery of the body of the latter as if have see they with my own eye will give you proof of my knowledge could you lay your hand upon those pills?""i have they say lestrade produce small white box take they and the purse and the telegram intend to have they put in place of safety at the police station it be the mere chance my take these pill for be bind to say that do not attach any importance to they ""give they here say holmes now doctor turn to i be those ordinary pills?"they certainly be not they be of pearly grey colour small round and almost transparent against the light from their lightness and transparency should imagine that they be soluble in water remark "precisely so answer holmes now would you mind go down and fetch that poor little devil of terrier which have be bad so long and which the landlady want you to put out of its pain yesterday "i go downstairs and carry the dog upstair in my arm it be labour breathing and glazing eye show that it be not far from its end indeed its snow white muzzle proclaim that it have already exceed the usual term of canine existence place it upon cushion on the rug "i will now cut one of these pill in two say holmes and draw his penknife he suit the action to the word one half we return into the box for future purpose the other half will place in this wine glass in which be teaspoonful of water you perceive that our friend the doctor be right and that it readily dissolve ""this may be very interesting say lestrade in the injure tone of one who suspect that he be be laugh at can not see however what it have to do with the death of mr. joseph stangerson ""patience my friend patience you will find in time that it have everything to do with it shall now add little milk to make the mixture palatable and on present it to the dog we find that he lap it up readily enough "as he speak he turn the content of the wine glass into saucer and place it in front of the terrier who speedily lick it dry sherlock holmes earnest demeanour have so far convince we that we all sit in silence watch the animal intently and expect some startling effect none such appear however the dog continue to lie stretch upon tho 16 cushion breathe in laboured way but apparently neither the well nor the bad for its draught holme have take out his watch and as minute follow minute without result an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appear upon his feature he gnaw his lip drum his finger upon the table and show every other symptom of acute impatience so great be his emotion that feel sincerely sorry for he while the two detective smile derisively by no mean displeased at this check which he have meet "it ca n't be coincidence he cry at last springing from his chair and pace wildly up and down the room it be impossible that it should be mere coincidence the very pill which suspect in the case of drebber be actually find after the death of stangerson and yet they be inert what can it mean surely my whole chain of reasoning can not have be false it be impossible and yet this wretched dog be none the bad ah have it have it with perfect shriek of delight he rush to the box cut the other pill in two dissolve it add milk and present it to the terrier the unfortunate creature 's tongue seem hardly to have be moisten in it before it give convulsive shiver in every limb and lie as rigid and lifeless as if it have be strike by lightning sherlock holmes draw long breath and wipe the perspiration from his forehead should have more faith he say ought to know by this time that when fact appear to be oppose to long train of deduction it invariably prove to be capable of bear some other interpretation of the two pill in that box one be of the most deadly poison and the other be entirely harmless ought to have know that before ever see the box at all "this last statement appear to i to be so startling that could hardly believe that he be in his sober sense there be the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture have be correct it seem to i that the mist in my own mind be gradually clear away and begin to have dim vague perception of the truth "all this seem strange to you continue holme because you fail at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which be present to you have the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which have occur since then have serve to confirm my original supposition and indeed be the logical sequence of it hence thing which have perplex you and make the case more obscure have serve to enlighten i and to strengthen my conclusion it be mistake to confound strangeness with mystery the most commonplace crime be often the most mysterious because it present no new or special feature from which deduction may be draw this murder would have be infinitely more difficult to unravel have the body of the victim be simply find lie in the roadway without any of thoseoutréand sensational accompaniment which have render it remarkable these strange detail far from make the case more difficult have really have the effect of make it less so "mr gregson who have listen to this address with considerable impatience could contain himself no long look here mr. sherlock holmes he say we be all ready to acknowledge that you be smart man and that you have your own method of working we want something more than mere theory and preach now though it be case of take the man have make my case out and it seem be wrong young charpentier could not have be engage in this second affair lestrade go after his man stangerson and it appear that he be wrong too you have throw out hint here and hint there and seem to know more than we do but the time have come when we feel that we have right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business can you name the man who do it?""i can not help feel that gregson be right sir remark lestrade we have both try and we have both fail you have remark more than once since have be in the room that you have all the evidence which you require surely you will not withhold it any long ""any delay in arrest the assassin observe might give he time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity "thus press by we all holmes show sign of irresolution he continue to walk up and down the room with his head sink on his chest and his brow draw down as be his habit when lose in thought "there will be no more murder he say at last stop abruptly and face we you can put that consideration out of the question you have ask i if know the name of the assassin do the mere knowing of his name be small thing however compare with the power of lay our hand upon he this expect very shortly to do have good hope of manage it through my own arrangement but it be thing which need delicate handling for we have shrewd and desperate man to deal with who be support as have have occasion to prove by another who be as clever as himself as long as this man have no idea that anyone can have clue there be some chance of secure he but if he have the slight suspicion he would change his name and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitant of this great city without meaning to hurt either of your feeling be bind to say that consider these man to be more than match for the official force and that be why have not ask your assistance if fail shall of course incur all the blame due to this omission but that be prepared for at present
