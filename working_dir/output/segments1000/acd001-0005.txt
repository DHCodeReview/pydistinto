mood throughout this grim district it comprise snow cap and lofty mountain and dark and gloomy valley there be swift flow river which dash through jagged ca√±on and there be enormous plain which in

land of despair band of pawnees or of blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting ground but the hardiest of the brave be glad to lose sight of those awesome plain and to find themselves once more upon their prairie the coyote skulk among the scrub the buzzard flap heavily through the air and the clumsy grizzly bear lumber through the dark ravine and pick up such sustenance as it can amongst the rock these be the sole dweller in the wilderness in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco as far as the eye can reach stretch the great flat plain land all dust over with patch of alkali and intersect by clump of the dwarfish chaparral bush on the extreme verge of the horizon lie long chain of mountain peak with their rugged summit fleck with snow in this great stretch of country there be no sign of life nor of anything appertain to life there be no bird in the steel blue heaven no movement upon the dull grey earth above all there be absolute silence listen as one may there be no shadow of sound in all that mighty wilderness nothing but silence complete and heart subdue silence it have

while the hand which grasp his rifle be hardly more fleshy than that of skeleton as he stand he lean upon his weapon for support and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bone suggest wiry and vigorous constitution his gaunt face however and his clothe which hang so baggily over his shrivelled limb proclaim what it be that give he that senile and decrepit appearance the man be die die from hunger and from thirst he have toil painfully down the ravine and on to this little elevation in the vain hope of see some sign of water now the great salt plain stretch before his eye and the distant belt of savage mountain without sign anywhere of plant or tree which might indicate the presence of moisture in all that broad landscape there be no gleam of hope north and east and west he look with wild questioning eye and then he realise that his wandering have come to an end and that there on that barren crag he be about to die why not here as well as in feather bed twenty year

dread be with whom they be face to face while the two voice the one thin and clear the other deep and harsh united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness the prayer finish they resume their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fall asleep nestle upon the broad breast of her protector he watch over her slumber for some time but nature prove to be too strong for he for three day and three night he have allow himself neither rest nor repose slowly the eyelid droop over the tired eye and the head sink lower and low upon the breast until the man 's grizzle beard be mix with the gold tress of his companion and both sleep the same deep and dreamless slumber have the wanderer remain awake for another half hour strange sight would have meet his eye far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rise up little spray of dust very slight at first and hardly to be distinguish from the mist of the distance but gradually grow high and broad until it form solid well define cloud this cloud continue to increase in size until it become evident that it could only be raise by great multitude of move creature in more fertile spot the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herd of bison which graze upon the prairie land be approach he this be obviously impossible in these arid wild as the whirl of dust draw near to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaway be repose the canvas cover tilt of waggon and the figure of armed horseman begin to show up through the haze and the apparition reveal itself as be great caravan upon its journey for the west but what caravan when the head of it have reach the base of the mountain the rear be not yet visible on the horizon right across the enormous plain stretch the straggling array waggon and cart man on horseback and man on foot innumerable woman who stagger along under burden and child who toddle beside the waggon or peep out from under the white covering this be evidently no ordinary party of immigrant but rather some nomad people who have be compel from stress of circumstance to seek themselves new country there rise through the clear air confused clattering and rumble from this great mass of humanity with the creaking of wheel and the neighing of horse loud as it be it be not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarer above they at the head of the column there ride score or more of grave ironface man clothe in sombre homespun garment and arm with rifle on reach the base of the bluff they halt and hold short council among themselves "the well be to the right my brother say one hard lipped clean shaven man with grizzly hair "to the right of the sierra blanco so we shall reach the rio grande say another "fear not for water cry third he who could draw it from the rock will not now abandon his own choose people ""amen amen respond the whole party they be about to resume their journey when one of the young and keen eyed utter an exclamation and point up at the rugged crag above they from its summit there flutter little wisp of pink show up hard and bright against the grey rock behind at the sight there be general rein up of horse and unslinging of gun while fresh horseman came gallop up to reinforce the vanguard the word redskins be on every lip "there ca n't be any number of injuns here say the elderly man who appear to be in command we have pass the pawnees and there be no other tribe until we cross the great mountain ""shall go forward and see brother stangerson ask one of the band "and and cry dozen voice "leave your horse below and we will

skyline the young man who have first give the alarm be lead they suddenly his follower see he throw up his hand as though overcome with astonishment and on join he they be affect in the same way by the sight which meet their eye on the little plateau which crown the barren hill there stand single giant boulder and against this boulder there lie tall man long bearded and hard feature but of an excessive thinness his placid face and regular breathing show that he be fast asleep beside he lie little child with her round white arm encircle his brown sinewy neck and her golden haired head rest upon the breast of his velveteen tunic her rosy lip be part show the regular line of snow white tooth within and playful smile play over her infantile feature her plump little white leg terminate in white sock and neat shoe with shine buckle offer strange contrast to the long shrivel member of her companion on the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stand three solemn buzzard who at the sight of the new comer utter raucous scream of disappointment and flap sullenly away the cry of the foul bird awake the two sleeper who stare about 20 they in bewilderment the man stagger to his foot and look down upon the plain which have be so desolate when sleep have overtake he and which be now traverse by this enormous body of man and of beast his face assume an expression of incredulity as he gaze and he pass his boney hand over his eye this be what they call delirium guess he mutter the child stand beside he hold on to the skirt of his coat and say nothing but look all round she with the wonder question gaze of childhood the rescue party be speedily able to convince the two castaway that their appearance be no delusion one of they seize the little girl and hoist she upon his shoulder while two other support her gaunt companion and assist he towards the waggon "my name be john ferrier the wanderer explain i and that little un be all that be leave twenty one people the rest be all dead thirst and hunger away down in the south ""is she your child ask someone "i guess she be now the other cry defiantly she be mine 'cause save she no man will take she from i she be lucy
