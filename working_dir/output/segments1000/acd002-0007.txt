suitor be so eligible one as sir henry and now pass on to another thread which have extricate out of the tangled skein the mystery of the sobs in the night of the tear stain face of mrs. barrymore of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window congratulate i my dear holmes and tell i that have not disappoint you as an agent that you do not regret the confidence which you show in i when you send i down all these thing have by one night 's work be thoroughly clear have say by one night 's work but in truth it be by two night work for on the first we draw entirely blank sit up with sir henry in his room until nearly three o'clock in the morning but no sound of any sort do we hear except the chiming clock upon the stair it be most melancholy vigil and end by each of we fall asleep in our chair fortunately we be not discourage and we determine to try again the next night we lower the lamp and sit smoke cigarette without make the least sound it be incredible how slowly the hour crawl by and yet we be help through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watch the trap into which he hope the game may wander one strike and two and we have almost for the second time give it up in despair when in an instant we both sit bolt upright in our chair with all our weary sense keenly on the alert once more we have hear the creak of step in the passage very stealthily we hear it pass along until it die away in the distance then the baronet gently open his door and we set out in pursuit already our man have go round the gallery and the corridor be all in darkness softly we steal along until we have come into the other wing we be just in time to catch glimpse of the tall black bearded figure his shoulder round as he tiptoe down the passage then he pass through the same door as before and the light of the candle frame it in the darkness and shoot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor we shuffle cautiously towards it try every plank before we dare to put our whole weight upon it we have take the precaution of leave our boot behind we but even so the old board snap and creak beneath our tread sometimes it seem impossible that he should fail to hear our approach however the man be fortunately rather deaf and he be entirely preoccupied in that which he be do when at last we reach the door and peep through we find he crouch at the window candle in hand his white intent face press against the pane exactly as have see he two night before we have arrange no plan of campaign but the baronet be man to whom the most direct way be always the most natural he walk into the room and as he do so barrymore spring up from the window with sharp hiss of his breath and stand livid and tremble before we his dark eye glare out of the white mask of his face be full of horror and astonishment as he gaze from sir henry to i "what be you do here barrymore?""nothe sir his agitation be so great that he could hardly speak and the shadow spring up and down from the shaking of his candle it be the window sir go round at night to see that they be fasten ""on the second floor?""yes sir all the window ""look here barrymore say sir henry sternly we have make up our mind to have the truth out of you so it will save you trouble to tell it soon rather than later come now no lie what be you do at that window?"the fellow look at we in helpless way and he wring his hand together like one who be in the last extremity of doubt and misery "i be do no harm sir be hold candle to the window ""and why be you hold candle to the window?""don't ask i sir henry do n't ask i give you my word sir that it be not my secret and that can not tell it if it concern no one but myself would not try to keep it from you "a sudden idea occur to i and take the candle from the tremble hand of the butler "he must have be hold it as signal say i. let we see if there be any answer hold it as he have do and stare out into the darkness of the night vaguely could discern the black bank of the tree and the light expanse of the moor for the moon be behind the cloud and then give cry of exultation for tiny pinpoint of yellow light have suddenly transfix the dark veil and glow steadily in the centre of the black square frame by the window "there it be cry "no no sir it be nothing nothing at all the butler break in assure you sir move your light across the window watson cry the baronet see the other move also now you rascal do you deny that it be signal come speak up who be your confederate out yonder and what be this conspiracy that be go on?"the man 's face become openly defiant it be my business and not yours will not tell ""then you leave my employment right away ""very good sir if must must ""and you go in disgrace by thunder you may well be ashamed of yourself your family have live with mine for over hundred year under this roof and here find you deep in some dark plot against i ""no no sir no not against you it be woman 's voice and mrs. barrymore paler and more horror strike than her husband be stand at the door her bulky figure in shawl and skirt might have be comic be it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face "we have to go eliza this be the end of it you can pack our thing say the butler "oh john john have bring you to this it be my doing sir henry all mine he have do nothing except for my sake and because ask he ""speak out then what do it mean?""my unhappy brother be starve on the moor we can not let he perish at our very gate the light be signal to he that food be ready for he and his light out yonder be to show the spot to which to bring it ""then your brother be the escaped convict sir selden the criminal ""that be the truth sir say barrymore say that it be not my secret and that could not tell it to you but now you have hear it and you will see that if there be plot it be not against you "this then be the explanation of the stealthy expedition at night and the light at the window sir henry and both stare at the woman in amazement be it possible that this stolidly respectable person be of the same blood as one of the most notorious criminal in the country?"yes sir my name be selden and he be my young brother we humour he too much when he be lad and give he his own way in everything until he come to think that the world be make for his pleasure and that he could do what he like in it then as he grow old he meet wicked companion and the devil enter into he until he break my mother 's heart and drag our name in the dirt from crime to crime he sink lower and low until it be only the mercy of god which have snatch he from the scaffold but to i sir he be always the little curly headed boy that have nurse and play with as an eld sister would that be why he break prison sir he know that be here and that we could not refuse to help he when he drag himself here one night weary and starve with the warder hard at his heel what could we do we take he in and feed he and care for he then you return sir and my brother think he would be safe on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry be over so he lie in hiding there but every second night we make sure if he be still there by put light in the window and if there be an answer my husband take out some bread and meat to he every day we hope that he be go but as long as he be there we could not desert he that be the whole truth as be an honest christian woman and you will see that if there be blame in the matter it do not lie with my husband but with i for whose sake he have do all that he have "the woman 's word come with an intense earnestness which carry conviction with they "is this true barrymore?""yes sir henry every word of it ""well can not blame you for stand by your own wife forget what have say go to your room you two and we shall talk far about this matter in the morning "when they be go we look out of the window again sir henry have fling it open and the cold night wind beat in upon our face far away in the black distance there still glow that one tiny point of yellow light "i wonder he dare say sir henry "it may be so place as to be only visible from here ""very likely how far do you think it is?""out by the cleft tor think ""not more than mile or two off ""hardly that ""well it can not be far if barrymore have to carry out the food to it and he be wait this villain beside that candle by thunder watson be go out to take that man!"the same thought have cross my own mind it be not as if the barrymores have take we into their confidence their secret have be force from they the man be danger to the community an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there be neither pity nor excuse we be only do our duty in take this chance of put he back where he could do no harm with his brutal and violent nature other would have to pay the price if we hold our hand any night for example our neighbour the stapletons might be attack by he and it may have be the thought of this which make sir henry so keen upon the adventure "i will come say i."then get your revolver and put on your boot the soon we start the well as the fellow may put out his light and be off "in five minute we be outside the door start upon our expedition we hurry through the dark shrubbery amid the dull moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the fall leave the night air be heavy with the smell of damp and decay now and again the moon peep out for an instant but cloud be drive over the face of the sky and just as we come out on the moor thin rain begin to fall the light still burn steadily in front "are you armed ask "i have hunting crop ""we must close in on he rapidly for he be say to be desperate fellow we shall take he by surprise and have he at our mercy before he can resist ""i say watson say the baronet what would holmes say to this how about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil be exalted?"as if in answer to his word there rise suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which have already hear upon the border of the great grimpen mire it come with the wind through the silence of the night long deep mutter then rise howl and then the sad moan in which it die away again and again it sound the whole air throbbing with it strident wild and menacing the baronet catch my sleeve and his face glimmer white through the darkness "my god what be that watson?""i do n't know it be sound they have on the moor hear it once before "it die away and an absolute silence close in upon we we stand strain our ear but nothing come "watson say the baronet it be the cry of hound "my blood run cold in my vein for there be break in his voice which tell of the sudden horror which have seize he "what do they call this sound he ask "who?""the folk on the countryside ""oh they be ignorant people why should you mind what they call it?""tell i watson what do they say of it?"i hesitate but could not escape the question "they say it be the cry of the hound of the baskervilles "he groan and be silent for few moment "a hound it be he say at last but it seem to come from mile away over yonder think ""it be hard to say whence it come ""it rise and fall with the wind be n't that the direction of the great grimpen mire?""yes it be ""well it be up there come now watson do n't you think yourself that it be the cry of hound be not child you need not fear to speak the truth ""stapleton be with i when hear it last he say that it might be the calling of strange bird ""no no it be hound my god can there be some truth in all these story be it possible that be really in danger from so dark cause you do n't believe it do you watson?""no no ""and yet it be one thing to laugh about it in london and it be another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such cry as that and my uncle there be the footprint of the hound beside he as he lie it all fit together do n't think that be coward watson but that sound seem to freeze my very blood feel my hand!"it be as cold as block of marble "you'll be all right tomorrow ""i do n't think 'll get that cry out of my head what do you advise that we do now?""shall we turn back?""no by thunder we have come out to get our man and we will do it we after the convict and hell hound as likely as not after we come on we 'll see it through if all the fiend of the pit be loose upon the moor "we stumble slowly along in the darkness with the black loom of the craggy hill around we and the yellow speck of light burn steadily in front there be nothing so deceptive as the distance of light upon pitch dark night and sometimes the glimmer seem to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might have be within few yard of we but at last we could see whence it come and then we know that we be indeed very close gutter candle be stick in crevice of the rock which flank it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from be visible save in the direction of baskerville hall boulder of granite conceal our approach and crouch behind it we gaze over it at the signal light it be strange to see this single candle burn there in the middle of the moor with no sign of life near it just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it "what shall we do now whisper sir henry "wait here he must be near his light let we see if we can get glimpse of he "the word be hardly out of my mouth when we both see he over the rock in the crevice of which the candle burn there be thrust out an evil yellow face terrible animal face all seam and score with vile passion foul with mire with bristle beard and hang with matted hair it might well have belong to one of those old savage who dwell in the burrow on the hillside the light beneath he be reflect in his small cunning eye which peer fiercely to right and leave through the darkness like crafty and savage animal who have hear the step of the hunter something have evidently arouse his suspicion it may have be that barrymore have some private signal which we have neglect to give or the fellow may have have some other reason for think that all be not well but could read his fear upon his wicked face any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness spring forward therefore and sir henry do the same at the same moment the convict scream out curse at we and hurl rock which splinter up against the boulder which have shelter we catch one glimpse of his short squat strongly build figure as he spring to his foot and turn to run at the same moment by lucky chance the moon break through the cloud we rush over the brow of the hill and there be our man run with great speed down the other side spring over the stone in his way with the activity of mountain goat lucky long shot of my revolver might have cripple he but have bring it only to defend myself if attack and not to shoot an unarmed man who be run away we be both swift runner and in fairly good training but we soon find that we have no chance of overtake he we see he for long time in the moonlight until he be only small speck move swiftly among the boulder upon the side of distant hill we run and run until we be completely blow but the space between we grow ever wider finally we stop and sit pant on two rock while we watch he disappear in the distance and it be at this moment that there occur most strange and unexpected thing we have rise from our rock and be turn to go home having abandon the hopeless chase the moon be low upon the right and the jagged pinnacle of granite tor stand up against the low curve of its silver disc there outline as black as an ebony statue on that shine background see the figure of man upon the tor do not think that it be delusion holmes assure you that have never in my life see anything more clearly as far as could judge the figure be that of tall thin man he stand with his leg little separated his arm fold his head bow as if he be brood over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lie before he he might have be the very spirit of that terrible place it be not the convict this man be far from the place where the latter have disappear besides he be much tall man with cry of surprise point he out to the baronet but in the instant during which have turn to grasp his arm the man be go there be the sharp pinnacle of granite still cut the low edge of the moon but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure wish to go in that direction and to search the tor but it be some distance away the baronet 's nerve be still quiver from that cry which recall the dark story of his family and he be not in the mood for fresh adventure he have not see this lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his command attitude have give to i warder no doubt say he the moor have be thick with they since this fellow escape well perhaps his explanation may be the right one but should like to have some further proof of it today we mean to communicate to the princetown people where they should look for their miss man but it be hard line that we have not actually have the triumph of bring he back as our own prisoner such be the adventure of last night and you must acknowledge my dear holmes that have do you very well in the matter of report much of what tell you be no doubt quite irrelevant but still feel that it be good that should let you have all the fact and leave you to select for yourself those which will be of most service to you in help you to your conclusion we be certainly make some progress so far as the barrymores go we have find the motive of their action and that have clear up the situation very much but the moor with its mystery and its strange inhabitant remain as inscrutable as ever perhaps in my next may be able to throw some light upon this also good of all would it be if you could come down to we in any case you will hear from i again in the course of the next few day so far have be able to quote from the report which have forward during these early day to sherlock holmes now however have arrive at point in my narrative where be compel to abandon this method and to trust once more to my recollection aid by the diary which keep at the time few extract from the latter will carry i on to those scene which be indelibly fix in every detail upon my memory proceed then from the morning which follow our abortive chase of the convict and our other strange experience upon the moor october 16th dull and foggy day with drizzle of rain the house be bank in with rolling cloud which rise now and then to show the dreary curve of the moor with thin silver vein upon the side of the hill and the distant boulder gleam where the light strike upon their wet face it be melancholy outside and in the baronet be in black reaction after the excitement of the night be conscious myself of weight at my heart and feeling of impend danger ever present danger which be the more terrible because be unable to define it and have not cause for such feeling consider the long sequence of incident which have all point to some sinister influence which be at work around we there be the death of the last occupant of the hall fulfil so exactly the condition of the family legend and there be the repeat report from peasant of the appearance of strange creature upon the moor twice have with my own ear hear the sound which resemble the distant baying of hound it be incredible impossible that it should really be outside the ordinary law of nature spectral hound which leave material footmark and fill the air with its howling be surely not to be think of stapleton may fall in with such superstition and mortimer also but if have one quality upon earth it be common sense and nothing will persuade i to believe in such thing to do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasant who be not content with mere fiend dog but must need describe he with hell fire shooting from his mouth and eye holme would not listen to such fancy and be his agent but fact be fact and have twice hear this cry upon the moor suppose that there be really some huge hound loose upon it that would go far to explain everything but where could such hound lie conceal where do it get its food where do it come from how be it that no one see it by day it must be confess that the natural explanation offer almost as many difficulty as the other and always apart from the hound there be the fact of the human agency in london the man in the cab and the letter which warn sir henry against the moor this at least be real but it might have be the work of protect friend as easily as of an enemy where be that friend or enemy now have he remain in london or have he follow we down here could he could he be the stranger whom see upon the tor?it be true that have have only the one glance at he and yet there be some thing to which be ready to swear he be no one whom have see down here and have now meet all the neighbour the figure be far tall than that of stapleton far thin than that of frankland barrymore it might possibly
