sherlock holmes take his bottle from the corner of the mantel piece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case with his long white nervous finger he adjust the delicate needle and roll back his left shirt cuff for some little time his eye rest thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dot and scar with innumerable puncture mark finally he thrust the sharp point home press down the tiny piston and sink back into the velvet line arm chair with long sigh of satisfaction three time day for many month have witness this performance but custom have not reconcile my mind to it on the contrary from day to day have become more irritable at the sight and my conscience swell nightly within i at the thought that have lack the courage to protest again and again have register vow that should deliver my soul upon the subject but there be that in the cool nonchalant air of my companion which make he the last man with whom one would care to take anything approach to liberty his great power his masterly manner and the experience which have have of his many extraordinary quality all make i diffident and backward in cross he yet upon that afternoon whether it be the beaune which have take with my lunch or the additional exasperation produce by the extreme deliberation of his manner suddenly feel that could hold out no long "which be it to day ask morphine or cocaine?"he raise his eye languidly from the old black letter volume which he have open it be cocaine he say seven per cent solution would you care to try it?""no indeed answer brusquely my constitution have not get over the afghan campaign yet can not afford to throw any extra strain upon it "he smile at my vehemence perhaps you be right watson he say suppose that its influence be physically bad one find it however so transcendently stimulate and clarify to the mind that its secondary action be matter of small moment ""but consider say earnestly count the cost your brain may as you say be rouse and excited but it be pathological and morbid process which involve increase tissue change and may at last leave permanent weakness you know too what black reaction come upon you surely the game be hardly worth the candle why should you for mere pass pleasure risk the loss of those great power with which you have be endow remember that speak not only as one comrade to another but as medical man to one for whose constitution he be to some extent answerable "he do not seem offend on the contrary he put his finger tip together and lean his elbow on the arm of his chair like one who have relish for conversation "my mind he say rebel at stagnation give i problem give i work give i the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis and be in my own proper atmosphere can dispense then with artificial stimulant but abhor the dull routine of existence crave for mental exaltation that be why have choose my own particular profession or rather create it for be the only one in the world ""the only unofficial detective say raise my eyebrow "the only unofficial consulting detective he answer be the last and high court of appeal in detection when gregson or lestrade or athelney jones be out of their depth which by the way be their normal state the matter be lay before i examine the datum as an expert and pronounce specialist 's opinion claim no credit in such case my name figure in no newspaper the work itself the pleasure of find field for my peculiar power be my high reward but you have yourself have some experience of my method of work in the jefferson hope case ""yes indeed say cordially be never so strike by anything in my life even embody it in small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of study in scarlet '"he shake his head sadly glance over it say he honestly can not congratulate you upon it detection be or ought to be an exact science and should be treat in the same cold and unemotional manner you have attempt to tinge it with romanticism which produce much the same effect as if you work love story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of euclid ""but the romance be there remonstrate could not tamper with the fact ""some fact should be suppress or at least just sense of proportion should be observe in treat they the only point in the case which deserve mention be the curious analytical reasoning from effect to cause by which succeed in unravel it "i be annoy at this criticism of work which have be specially design to please he confess too that be irritated by the egotism which seem to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doing more than once during the year that have live with he in baker street have observe that small vanity underlay my companion 's quiet and didactic manner make no remark however but sat nurse my wound leg have jezail bullet through it some time before and though it do not prevent i from walk it ache wearily at every change of the weather "my practice have extend recently to the continent say holmes after while fill up his old bri root pipe be consult last week by francois le villard who as you probably know have come rather to the front lately in the french detective service he have all the celtic power of quick intuition but he be deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which be essential to the high development of his art the case be concern with will and possess some feature of interest be able to refer he to two parallel case the one at riga in 1857 and the other at st. louis in 1871 which have suggest to he the true solution here be the letter which have this morning acknowledge my assistance he toss over as he speak crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper glance my eye down it catch profusion of note of admiration with stray magnifique coup de maitre and tour de force all testify to the ardent admiration of the frenchman "he speak as pupil to his master say i."oh he rate my assistance too highly say sherlock holmes lightly he have considerable gift himself he possess two out of the three quality necessary for the ideal detective he have the power of observation and that of deduction he be only want in knowledge and that may come in time he be now translate my small work into french ""your works?""oh do n't you know he cry laugh yes have be guilty of several monograph they be all upon technical subject here for example be one upon the distinction between the ashes of the various tobaccoes in it enumerate hundred and forty form of cigar- cigarette- and pipe tobacco with colored plate illustrate the difference in the ash it be point which be continually turn up in criminal trial and which be sometimes of supreme importance as clue if you can say definitely for example that some murder have be do by man who be smoke an indian lunkah it obviously narrow your field of search to the train eye there be as much difference between the black ash of trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird's eye as there be between cabbage and potato ""you have an extraordinary genius for minutiae remark "i appreciate their importance here be my monograph upon the tracing of footstep with some remark upon the use of plaster of paris as preserver of impress here too be curious little work upon the influence of trade upon the form of the hand with lithotype of the hand of slater sailor corkcutter compositor weaver and diamond polisher that be matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective especially in case of unclaimed body or in discover the antecedent of criminal but weary you with my hobby ""not at all answer earnestly it be of the great interest to i especially since have have the opportunity of observe your practical application of it but you speak just now of observation and deduction surely the one to some extent imply the other ""why hardly he answer lean back luxuriously in his arm chair and send up thick blue wreath from his pipe for example observation show i that you have be to the wigmore street post office this morning but deduction let i know that when there you dispatch telegram ""right say i. right on both point but confess that do n't see how you arrive at it it be sudden impulse upon my part and have mention it to no one ""it be simplicity itself he remark chuckle at my surprise so absurdly simple that an explanation be superfluous and yet it may serve to define the limit of observation and of deduction observation tell i that you have little reddish mould adhere to your instep just opposite the seymour street office they have take up the pavement and throw up some earth which lie in such way that it be difficult to avoid tread in it in enter the earth be of this peculiar reddish tint which be find as far as know nowhere else in the neighborhood so much be observation the rest be deduction ""how then do you deduce the telegram?""why of course know that you have not write letter since sit opposite to you all morning see also in your open desk there that you have sheet of stamp and thick bundle of post card what could you go into the post office for then but to send wire eliminate all other factor and the one which remain must be the truth ""in this case it certainly be so reply after little thought the thing however be as you say of the simple would you think i impertinent if be to put your theory to more severe test?""on the contrary he answer it would prevent i from take second dose of cocaine should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to i ""i have hear you say that it be difficult for man to have any object in daily use without leave the impress of his individuality upon it in such way that train observer might read it now have here watch which have recently come into my possession would you have the kindness to let i have an opinion upon the character or habit of the late owner?"i hand he over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart for the test be as think an impossible one and intend it as lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assume he balance the watch in his hand gaze hard at the dial open the back and examine the work first with his naked eye and then with powerful convex lens could hardly keep from smile at his crestfallen face when he finally snap the case to and hand it back "there be hardly any datum he remark the watch have be recently clean which rob i of my most suggestive fact ""you be right answer it be clean before be send to i in my heart accuse my companion of put forward most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure what data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?"though unsatisfactory my research have not be entirely barren he observe stare up at the ceiling with dreamy lack lustre eye subject to your correction should judge that the watch belong to your eld brother who inherit it from your father ""that you gather no doubt from the h. w. upon the back?""quite so the w. suggest your own name the date of the watch be nearly fifty year back and the initial be as old as the watch so it be make for the last generation jewelry usually descend to the eld son and he be most likely to have the same name as the father your father have if remember right be dead many year it have therefore be in the hand of your eld brother ""right so far say i. anything else?""he be man of untidy habit very untidy and careless he be leave with good prospect but he throw away his chance live for some time in poverty with occasional short interval of prosperity and finally take to drink he die that be all can gather "i spring from my chair and limp impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart "this be unworthy of you holmes say could not have believe that you would have descend to this you have make inquire into the history of my unhappy brother and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way you can not expect i to believe that you have read all this from his old watch it be unkind and to speak plainly have touch of charlatanism in it ""my dear doctor say he kindly pray accept my apology view the matter as an abstract problem have forget how personal and painful thing it might be to you assure you however that never even know that you have brother until you hand i the watch ""then how in the name of all that be wonderful do you get these fact they be absolutely correct in every particular ""ah that be good luck could only say what be the balance of probability do not at all expect to be so accurate ""but it be not mere guess work?""no no never guess it be shocking habit destructive to the logical faculty what seem strange to you be only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small fact upon which large inference may depend for example begin by state that your brother be careless when you observe the low part of that watch case you notice that it be not only dinte in two place but it be cut and mark all over from the habit of keep other hard object such as coin or key in the same pocket surely it be no great feat to assume that man who treat fifty guinea watch so cavalierly must be careless man neither be it very far fetched inference that man who inherit one article of such value be pretty well provide for in other respect "i nod to show that follow his reasoning "it be very customary for pawnbroker in england when they take watch to scratch the number of the ticket with pin point upon the inside of the case it be more handy than label as there be no risk of the number be lose or transpose there be no less than four such number visible to my lens on the inside of this case inference that your brother be often at low water secondary inference that he have occasional burst of prosperity or he could not have redeem the pledge finally ask you to look at the inner plate which contain the key hole look at the thousand of scratch all round the hole mark where the key have slip what sober man 's key could have score those groove but you will never see drunkard 's watch without they he wind it at night and he leave these trace of his unsteady hand where be the mystery in all this?""it be as clear as daylight answer regret the injustice which do you should have have more faith in your marvellous faculty may ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present?""none hence the cocaine can not live without brain work what else be there to live for stand at the window here be ever such dreary dismal unprofitable world see how the yellow fog swirl down the street and drift across the dun color house what could be more hopelessly prosaic and material what be the use of have power doctor when one have no field upon which to exert they crime be commonplace existence be commonplace and no quality save those which be commonplace have any function upon earth "i have open my mouth to reply to this tirade when with crisp knock our landlady enter bear card upon the brass salver "a young lady for you sir she say address my companion "miss mary morstan he read hum have no recollection of the name ask the young lady to step up mrs. hudson do n't go doctor should prefer that you remain "miss morstan enter the room with firm step and an outward composure of manner she be blonde young lady small dainty well gloved and dress in the most perfect taste there be however plainness and simplicity about her costume which bear with it suggestion of limited mean the dress be sombre grayish beige untrimmed and unbraided and she wear small turban of the same dull hue relieve only by suspicion of white feather in the side her face have neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion but her expression be sweet and amiable and her large blue eye be singularly spiritual and sympathetic in an experience of woman which extend over many nation and three separate continent have never look upon face which give clear promise of refined and sensitive nature could not but observe that as she take the seat which sherlock holmes place for she her lip tremble her hand quiver and she show every sign of intense inward agitation "i have come to you mr. holmes she say because you once enable my employer mrs. cecil forrester to unravel little domestic complication she be much impressed by your kindness and skill ""mrs cecil forrester he repeat thoughtfully believe that be of some slight service to she the case however as remember it be very simple one ""she do not think so but at least you can not say the same of mine can hardly imagine anything more strange more utterly inexplicable than the situation in which find myself "holme rub his hand and his eye glisten he lean forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear cut hawklike feature state your case say he in brisk business tone feel that my position be an embarrassing one you will be sure excuse i say rise from my chair to my surprise the young lady hold up her gloved hand to detain i if your friend she say would be good enough to stop he might be of inestimable service to i "i relapse into my chair "briefly she continue the fact be these my father be an officer in an indian regiment who send i home when be quite child my mother be dead and have no relative in england be place however in comfortable boarding establishment at edinburgh and there remain until be seventeen year of age in the year 1878 my father who be senior captain of his regiment obtain twelve month leave and come home he telegraph to i from london that he have arrive all safe and

we advertise in all the paper our inquiry lead to no result and from that day to this no word have ever be hear of my unfortunate father he come home with his heart full of hope to find some peace some comfort and instead she put her hand to her throat and choke sob cut short the sentence "the date ask holmes open his note book "he disappear upon the 3d of december 1878 nearly ten year ago ""his luggage?""remaine at the hotel there be nothing in it to suggest clue some clothe some book and considerable number of curiosity from the andaman islands he have be one of the officer in charge of the convict guard there ""had he any friend in town?""only one that we know of major sholto of his own regiment the 34th bombay infantry the major have retire some little time before and live at upper norwood we communicate with he of course but he do not even know that his brother officer be in england ""a singular case remark holmes "i have not yet describe to you the most singular part
