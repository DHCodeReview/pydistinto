shall be back in an hour "i sit in the window with the volume in my hand but my thought be far from the daring speculation of the writer my mind run upon our late visitor her smile the deep rich tone of her voice the strange mystery which overhang her life if she be seventeen at the time of her father 's disappearance she must be seven and twenty now sweet age when youth have lose its self consciousness and become little sober by experience so sit and muse until such dangerous thought come into my head that hurry away to my desk and plunge furiously into the late treatise upon pathology what be an army surgeon with weak leg and weak banking account that should dare to think of such thing she be unit factor nothing more if my future be black it be well surely to face it like man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will o'-the wisps of the imagination it be half past five before holme return he be bright eager and in excellent spirit mood which in his case alternate with fit of the black depression "there be no great mystery in this matter he say take the cup of tea which have pour out for he the fact appear to admit of only one explanation ""what you have solve it already?""well that would be too much to say have discover suggestive fact that be all it be however very suggestive the detail be still to be add have just find on consult the back file of the times that major sholto of upper norword late of the 34th bombay infantry die upon the 28th of april 1882.""i may be very obtuse holmes but fail to see what this suggest ""no you surprise i look at it in this way then captain morstan disappear the only person in london whom he could have visit be major sholto major sholto deny having hear that he be in london four year later sholto die within week of his death captain morstan 's daughter receive valuable present which be repeat from year to year and now culminate in letter which describe she as wrong woman what wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father and why should the present begin immediately after sholto 's death unless it be that sholto 's heir know something of the mystery and desire to make compensation have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?""but what strange compensation and how strangely make why too should he write letter now rather than six year ago again the letter speak of give her justice what justice can she have it be too much to suppose that her father be still alive there be no other injustice in her case that you know of ""there be difficulty there be certainly difficulty say sherlock holmes pensively but our expedition of to night will solve they all ah here be four wheeler and miss morstan be inside be you all ready then we have well go down for it be little past the hour "i pick up my hat and my heavy stick but observe that holmes take his revolver from his drawer and slip it into his pocket it be clear that he think that our night 's work might be serious one miss morstan be muffle in dark cloak and her sensitive face be compose but pale she must have be more than woman if she do not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we be embark yet her self control be perfect and she readily answer the few additional question which sherlock holmes put to she "major sholto be very particular friend of papa 's she say his letter be full of allusion to the major he and papa be in command of the troop at the andaman islands so they be throw great deal together by the way curious paper be find in papa 's desk which no one could understand do n't suppose that it be of the slight importance but think you might care to see it so bring it with i it be here "holme unfold the paper carefully and smooth it out upon his knee he then very methodically examine it all over with his double lens "it be paper of native indian manufacture he remark it have at some time be pin to board the diagram upon it appear to be plan of part of large building with numerous hall corridor and passage at one point be small cross do in red ink and above it be 3.37 from leave in faded pencil writing in the left hand corner be curious hieroglyphic like four crosse in line with their arm touching beside it be write in very rough and coarse character the sign of the four jonathan small mahomet singh abdullah khan dost akbar no confess that do not see how this bear upon the matter yet it be evidently document of importance it have be keep carefully in pocket book for the one side be as clean as the other ""it be in his pocket book that we find it ""preserve it carefully then miss morstan for it may prove to be of use to we begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deep and more subtle than at first suppose must reconsider my idea he lean back in the cab and could see by his draw brow and his vacant eye that he be think intently miss morstan and chat in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome but our companion maintain his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey it be september evening and not yet seven o'clock but the day have be dreary one and dense drizzly fog lie low upon the great city mud color cloud droop sadly over the muddy street down the strand the lamp be but misty splotch of diffused light which throw feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement the yellow glare from the shop windows stream out into the steamy vaporous air and throw murky shift radiance across the crowded thoroughfare there be to my mind something eerie and ghost like in the endless procession of face which flit across these narrow bar of light sad face and glad haggard and merry like all human kind they flit from the gloom into the light and so back into the gloom once more be not subject to impression but the dull heavy evening with the strange business upon which we be engage combine to make i nervous and depressed could see from miss morstan 's manner that she be suffer from the same feeling holme alone could rise superior to petty influence he hold his open note book upon his knee and from time to time he jot down figure and memorandum in the light of his pocket lantern at the lyceum theatre the crowd be already thick at the side entrance in front continuous stream of hansom and four wheeler be rattle up discharge their cargo of shirt front man and beshawle bediamonded woman we have hardly reach the third pillar which be our rendezvous before small dark brisk man in the dress of coachman accost we "are you the party who come with miss morstan he ask "i be miss morstan and these two gentleman be my friend say she he bend pair of wonderfully penetrate and question eye upon we you will excuse i miss he say with certain dogged manner but be to ask you to give i your word that neither of your companion be police officer ""i give you my word on that she answer he give shrill whistle on which street arab lead across four wheeler and open the door the man who have address we mount to the box while we take our place inside we have hardly do so before the driver whip up his horse and we plunge away at furious pace through the foggy street the situation be curious one we be drive to an unknown place on an unknown errand yet our invitation be either complete hoax which be an inconceivable hypothesis or else we have good reason to think that important issue might hang upon our journey miss morstan 's demeanor be as resolute and collect as ever endeavor to cheer and amuse she by reminiscence of my adventure in afghanistan but to tell the truth be myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my story be slightly involve to this day she declare that tell her one move anecdote as to how musket look into my tent at the dead of night and how fire double barrel tiger cub at it at first have some idea as to the direction in which we be drive but soon what with our pace the fog and my own limited knowledge of london lose my bearing and know nothing save that we seem to be go very long way sherlock holmes be never at fault however and he mutter the name as the cab rattle through square and in and out by tortuous by street "rochester row say he now vincent square now we come out on the vauxhall bridge road we be make for the surrey side apparently yes think so now we be on the bridge you can catch glimpse of the river "we do indeed get fleeting view of stretch of the thames with the lamp shine upon the broad silent water but our cab dash on and be soon involve in labyrinth of street upon the other side "wordsworth road say my companion priory road lark hall lane stockwell place robert street cold harbor lane our quest do not appear to take we to very fashionable region "we have indeed reach questionable and forbid neighborhood long line of dull brick house be only relieve by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public house at the corner then come row of two story villa each with fronting of miniature garden and then again interminable line of new stare brick building the monster tentacle which the giant city be throw out into the country at last the cab draw up at the third house in new terrace none of the other house be inhabit and that at which we stop be as dark as its neighbor save for single glimmer in the kitchen window on our knocking however the door be instantly throw open by hindoo servant clothe in yellow turban white loose fitting clothe and yellow sash there be something strangely incongruous in this oriental figure frame in the commonplace door way of third rate suburban dwelling house "the sahib await you say he and even as he speak there come high piping voice from some inner room show they in to i khitmutgar it cry show they straight in to i "we follow the indian down sordid and common passage ill lit and bad furnished until he come to door upon the right which he throw open blaze of yellow light stream out upon we and in the centre of the glare there stand small man with very high head bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it and bald shine scalp which shoot out from among it like mountain peak from fir tree he writhe his hand together as he stand and his feature be in perpetual jerk now smile now scowl but never for an instant in repose nature have give he pendulous lip and too visible line of yellow and irregular tooth which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly pass his hand over the low part of his face in spite of his obtrusive baldness he give the impression of youth in point of fact he have just turn his thirtieth year "your servant miss morstan he keep repeat in thin high voice your servant gentleman pray step into my little sanctum small place miss but furnish to my own liking an oasis of art in the howl desert of south london "we be all astonish by the appearance of the apartment into which he invite we in that sorry house it look as out of place as diamond of the first water in setting of brass the rich and glossy of curtain and tapestry drape the wall loop back here and there to expose some richly mount painting or oriental vase the carpet be of amber and black so soft and so thick that the foot sink pleasantly into it as into bed of moss two great tiger skin throw athwart it increase the suggestion of eastern luxury as do huge hookah which stand upon mat in the corner lamp in the fashion of silver dove be hang from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room as it burn it fill the air with subtle and aromatic odor "mr thaddeus sholto say the little man still jerk and smile that be my name you be miss morstan of course and these gentleman this be mr. sherlock holmes and this be dr. watson ""a doctor eh cry he much excited have you your stethoscope might ask you would you have the kindness have grave doubt as to my mitral valve if you would be so very good the aortic may rely upon but should value your opinion upon the mitral "i listen to his heart as request but be unable to find anything amiss save indeed that he be in an ecstasy of fear for he shiver from head to foot it appear to be normal say you have no cause for uneasiness ""you will excuse my anxiety miss morstan he remark airily be great sufferer and have long have suspicion as to that valve be delighted to hear that they be unwarranted have your father miss morstan refrain from throw strain upon his heart he might have be alive now "i could have strike the man across the face so hot be at this callous and off hand reference to so delicate matter miss morstan sit down and her face grow white to the lip know in my heart that he be dead say she "i can give you every information say he and what be more can do you justice and will too whatever brother bartholomew may say be so glad to have your friend here not only as an escort to you but also as witness to what be about to do and say the three of we can show bold front to brother bartholomew but let we have no outsider no police or official we can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves without any interference nothing would annoy brother bartholomew more than any publicity he sit down upon low settee and blink at we inquiringly with his weak watery blue eye "for my part say holmes whatever you may choose to say will go no far "i nod to show my agreement "that be well that be well say he may offer you glass of chianti miss morstan or of tokay keep no other wine shall open flask no well then trust that you have no objection to tobacco smoke to the mild balsamic odor of the eastern tobacco be little nervous and find my hookah an invaluable sedative he apply taper to the great bowl and the smoke bubble merrily through the rose water we sit all three in semicircle with our head advanced and our chin upon our hand while the strange jerky little fellow with his high shine head puff uneasily in the centre "when first determine to make this communication to you say he might have give you my address but fear that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you take the liberty therefore of make an appointment in such way that my man williams might be able to see you first have complete confidence in his discretion and he have order if he be dissatisfied to proceed no far in the matter you will excuse these precaution but be man of somewhat retire and might even say refine taste and there be nothing more unaesthetic than policeman have natural shrinking from all form of rough materialism seldom come in contact with the rough crowd live as you see with some little atmosphere of elegance around i may call myself patron of the art it be my weakness the landscape be genuine corot and though connoisseur might perhaps throw doubt upon that salvator rosa there can not be the least question about the bouguereau be partial to the modern french school ""you will excuse i mr. sholto say miss morstan but be here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell i it be very late and should desire the interview to be as short as possible ""at the good it must take some time he answer for we shall certainly have to go to norwood and see brother bartholomew we shall all go and try if we can get the well of brother bartholomew he be very angry with i for take the course which have seem right to i have quite high word with he last night you can not imagine what terrible fellow he be when he be angry ""if we be to go to norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once venture to remark he laugh until his ear be quite red that would hardly do he cry do n't know what he would say if bring you in that sudden way no must prepare you by show you how we all stand to each other in the first place must tell you that there be several point in the story of which be myself ignorant can only lay the fact before you as far as know they myself "my father be as you may have guess major john sholto once of the indian army he retire some eleven year ago and come to live at pondicherry lodge in upper norwood he have prosper in india and bring back with he considerable sum of money large collection of valuable curiosity and staff of native servant with these advantage he buy himself house and live in great luxury my twin brother bartholomew and be the only child "i very well remember the sensation which be cause by the disappearance of captain morstan we read the detail in the paper and know that he have be friend of our father 's we discuss the case freely in his presence he use to join in our speculation as to what could have happen never for an instant do we suspect that he have the whole secret hide in his own breast that of all man he alone know the fate of arthur morstan "we do know however that some mystery some positive danger overhang our father he be very fearful of go out alone and he always employ two prize fighter to act as porter at pondicherry lodge williams who drive you to night be one of they he be once light weight champion of england our father would never tell we what it be he fear but he have most marked aversion to man with wooden leg on one occasion he actually fire his revolver at wooden

towards the end of april we be inform that he be beyond all hope and that he wish to make last communication to we "when we enter his room he be prop up with pillow and breathe heavily he beseech we to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed then grasp our hand he make remarkable statement to we in voice which be break as much by emotion as by pain shall try and give it to you in his own very word "'i have only one thing he say which weigh upon my mind at this supreme moment it be my treatment of poor morstan 's orphan the cursed greed which have be my beset sin through life
