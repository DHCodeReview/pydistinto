above the ear "it look like thorn say i."it be thorn you may pick it out but be careful for it be poison "i take it up between my finger and thumb it come away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark be leave behind one tiny speck of blood show where the puncture have be "this be all an insoluble mystery to i say i. it grow dark instead of clear ""on the contrary he answer it clear every instant only require few miss link to have an entirely connected case "we have almost forget our companion 's presence since we enter the chamber he be still stand in the door way the very picture of terror wring his hand and moan to himself suddenly however he break out into sharp querulous cry "the treasure be go he say they have rob he of the treasure there be the hole through which we lower it help he to do it be the last person who see he leave he here last night and hear he lock the door as come down stair ""what time be that?""it be ten o'clock and now he be dead and the police will be call in and shall be suspect of having have hand in it oh yes be sure shall but you do n't think so gentleman surely you do n't think that it be be it likely that would have bring you here if it be oh dear oh dear know that shall go mad he jerk his arm and stamp his foot in kind of convulsive frenzy "you have no reason for fear mr. sholto say holmes kindly put his hand upon his shoulder take my advice and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police offer to assist they in every way we shall wait here until your return "the little man obey in half stupefied fashion and we hear he stumble down the stair in the dark "now watson say holmes rub his hand we have half an hour to ourselves let we make good use of it my case be as have tell you almost complete but we must not err on the side of over confidence simple as the case seem now there may be something deep underlie it ""simple ejaculate "surely say he with something of the air of clinical professor expound to his class just sit in the corner there that your footprint may not complicate matter now to work in the first place how do these folk come and how do they go the door have not be open since last night how of the window he carry the lamp across to it mutter his observation aloud the while but address they to himself rather than to i window be snibbe on the inner side framework be solid no hinge at the side let we open it no water pipe near roof quite out of reach yet man have mount by the window it rain little last night here be the print of foot in mould upon the sill and here be circular muddy mark and here again upon the floor and here again by the table see here watson this be really very pretty demonstration "i look at the round well define muddy disc this be not footmark say i."it be something much more valuable to we it be the impression of wooden stump you see here on the sill be the boot mark heavy boot with the broad metal heel and beside it be the mark of the timber toe ""it be the wooden legged man ""quite so but there have be some one else very able and efficient ally could you scale that wall doctor?"i look out of the open window the moon still shine brightly on that angle of the house we be good sixty foot from the ground and look where would could see no foothold nor as much as crevice in the brick work "it be absolutely impossible answer "without aid it be so but suppose you have friend up here who lower you this good stout rope which see in the corner secure one end of it to this great hook in the wall then think if you be an active man you might swarm up wooden leg and all you would depart of course in the same fashion and your ally would draw up the rope untie it from the hook shut the window snib it on the inside and get away in the way that he originally come as minor point it may be note he continue finger the rope that our wooden legged friend though fair climber be not professional sailor his hand be far from horny my lens disclose more than one blood mark especially towards the end of the rope from which gather that he slip down with such velocity that he take the skin off his hand ""this be all very well say but the thing become more unintelligible than ever how about this mysterious ally how come he into the room?""yes the ally repeat holmes pensively there be feature of interest about this ally he lift the case from the region of the commonplace fancy that this ally break fresh ground in the annal of crime in this country though parallel case suggest themselves from india and if my memory serve i from senegambia ""how come he then reiterate the door be lock the window be inaccessible be it through the chimney?""the grate be much too small he answer have already consider that possibility ""how then persist "you will not apply my precept he say shake his head how often have say to you that when you have eliminate the impossible whatever remain however improbable must be the truth we know that he do not come through the door the window or the chimney we also know that he could not have be conceal in the room as there be no concealment possible whence then do he come?""he come through the hole in the roof cry "of course he do he must have do so if you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for i we shall now extend our research to the room above the secret room in which the treasure be find "he mount the step and seize rafter with either hand he swing himself up into the garret then lie on his face he reach down for the lamp and hold it while follow he the chamber in which we find ourselves be about ten foot one way and six the other the floor be form by the rafter with thin lath and plaster between so that in walk one have to step from beam to beam the roof run up to an apex and be evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house there be no furniture of any sort and the accumulate dust of year lie thick upon the floor "here you be you see say sherlock holmes put his hand against the slope wall this be trap door which lead out on to the roof can press it back and here be the roof itself slope at gentle angle this then be the way by which number one enter let we see if we can find any other trace of his individuality "he hold down the lamp to the floor and as he do so see for the second time that night startled surprised look come over his face for myself as follow his gaze my skin be cold under my clothe the floor be cover thickly with the print of naked foot clear well define perfectly form but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man "holme say in whisper child have do the horrid thing "he have recover his self possession in an instant be stagger for the moment he say but the thing be quite natural my memory fail i or should have be able to foretell it there be nothing more to be learn here let we go down ""what be your theory then as to those footmark ask eagerly when we have regain the low room once more "my dear watson try little analysis yourself say he with touch of impatience you know my method apply they and it will be instructive to compare result ""i can not conceive anything which will cover the fact answer "it will be clear enough to you soon he say in an off hand way think that there be nothing else of importance here but will look he whip out his lens and tape measure and hurry about the room on his knee measure compare examine with his long thin nose only few inch from the plank and his beady eye gleam and deep set like those of bird so swift silent and furtive be his movement like those of train blood hound pick out scent that could not but think what terrible criminal he would have make have he turn his energy and sagacity against the law instead of exert they in its defense as he hunt about he keep mutter to himself and finally he break out into loud crow of delight "we be certainly in luck say he we ought to have very little trouble now number one have have the misfortune to tread in the creosote you can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil smell mess the carboy have be crack you see and the stuff have leak out ""what then ask "why we have get he that be all say he know dog that would follow that scent to the world 's end if pack can track trailed herre across shire how far can specially train hound follow so pungent smell as this it sound like sum in the rule of three the answer should give we the but halloo here be the accredit representative of the law "heavy step and the clamor of loud voice be audible from below and the hall door shut with loud crash "before they come say holmes just put your hand here on this poor fellow 's arm and here on his leg what do you feel?""the muscle be as hard as board answer "quite so they be in state of extreme contraction far exceed the usual rigor mortis couple with this distortion of the face this hippocratic smile or risus sardonicus as the old writer call it what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?""death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid answer some strychnine like substance which would produce tetanus ""that be the idea which occur to i the instant see the draw muscle of the face on get into the room at once look for the mean by which the poison have enter the system as you see discover thorn which have be drive or shoot with no great force into the scalp you observe that the part strike be that which would be turn towards the hole in the ceiling if the man be erect in his chair now examine the thorn "i take it up gingerly and hold it in the light of the lantern it be long sharp and black with glaze look near the point as though some gummy substance have dry upon it the blunt end have be trim and round off with knife "is that an english thorn he ask "no it certainly be not ""with all these datum you should be able to draw some just inference but here be the regular so the auxiliary force may beat retreat "as he speak the step which have be come near sound loudly on the passage and very stout portly man in gray suit stride heavily into the room he be red face burly and plethoric with pair of very small twinkling eye which look keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouch he be closely follow by an inspector in uniform and by the still palpitate thaddeus sholto "here be business he cry in muffled husky voice here be pretty business but who be all these why the house seem to be as full as rabbit warren!""i think you must recollect i mr. athelney jones say holmes quietly "why of course do he wheeze it be mr. sherlock holmes the theorist remember you 'll never forget how you lecture we all on cause and inference and effect in the bishopgate jewel case it be true you set we on the right track but you 'll own now that it be more by good luck than good guidance ""it be piece of very simple reasoning ""oh come now come never be ashamed to own up but what be all this bad business bad business stern fact here no room for theory how lucky that happen to be out at norwood over another case be at the station when the message arrive what d'you think the man die of?""oh this be hardly case for i to theorize over say holmes dryly "no no still we ca n't deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes dear i door lock understand jewel worth half million missing how be the window?""fastened but there be step on the sill ""well well if it be fasten the step could have nothing to do with the matter that be common sense man might have die in fit but then the jewel be miss ha have theory these flash come upon i at time just step outside sergeant and you mr. sholto your friend can remain what do you think of this holmes sholto be on his own confession with his brother last night the brother die in fit on which sholto walk off with the treasure how be that?""on which the dead man very considerately get up and lock the door on the inside ""hum there be flaw there let we apply common sense to the matter this thaddeus sholto be with his brother there be quarrel so much we know the brother be dead and the jewel be go so much also we know no one see the brother from the time thaddeus leave he his bed have not be sleep in thaddeus be evidently in most disturbed state of mind his appearance be well not attractive you see that be weave my web round thaddeus the net begin to close upon he ""you be not quite in possession of the fact yet say holmes this splinter of wood which have every reason to believe to be poison be in the man 's scalp where you still see the mark this card inscribe as you see it be on the table and beside it lie this rather curious stone head instrument how do all that fit into your theory?""confirm it in every respect say the fat detective pompously house be full of indian curiosity thaddeus bring this up and if this splinter be poisonous thaddeus may as well have make murderous use of it as any other man the card be some hocus pocus blind as like as not the only question be how do he depart ah of course here be hole in the roof with great activity consider his bulk he spring up the step and squeeze through into the garret and immediately afterwards we hear his exulting voice proclaim that he have find the trap door "he can find something remark holmes shrug his shoulder he have occasional glimmering of reason il n'y pas des sot si incommode que ceux qui ont de l'esprit you see say athelney jones reappear down the step again fact be well than mere theory after all my view of the case be confirm there be trap door communicating with the roof and it be partly open ""it be who open it ""oh indeed you do notice it then he seem little crestfallen at the discovery well whoever notice it it show how our gentleman get away inspector!""yes sir from the passage "ask mr. sholto to step this way mr. sholto it be my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be use against you arrest you in the queen 's name as be concern in the death of your brother ""there now do n't tell you cry the poor little man throw out his hand and look from one to the other of we "don't trouble yourself about it mr. sholto say holmes think that can engage to clear you of the charge ""don't promise too much mr. theorist do n't promise too much snap the detective you may find it hard matter than you think ""not only will clear he mr. jones but will make you free present of the name and description of one of the two people who be in this room last night his name have every reason to believe be jonathan small he be poorly educate man small active with his right leg off and wear wooden stump which be wear away upon the inner side his left boot have coarse square toe sole with an iron band round the heel he be middle aged man much sunburned and have be convict these few indication may be of some assistance to you couple with the fact that there be good deal of skin miss from the palm of his hand the other man ah the other man ask athelney jones in sneering voice but impress none the less as could easily see by the precision of the other 's manner "is rather curious person say sherlock holmes turn upon his heel hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of they word with you watson "he lead i out to the head of the stair this unexpected occurrence he say have cause we rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey ""i have just be think so answer it be not right that miss morstan should remain in this stricken house ""no you must escort her home she live with mrs. cecil forrester in lower camberwell so it be not very far will wait for you here if you will drive out again or perhaps you be too tired?""by no mean do n't think could rest until know more of this fantastic business have see something of the rough side of life but give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprise to night have shake my nerve completely should like however to see the matter through with you now that have get so far ""your presence will be of great service to i he answer we shall work the case out independently and leave this fellow jones to exult over any mare's nest which he may choose to construct when you have drop miss morstan wish you to go on to no pinchin lane down near the water 's edge at lambeth the third house on the right hand side be bird stuffer 's sherman be the name you will see weasel hold young rabbit in the window knock old sherman up and tell he with my compliment that want toby at once you will bring toby back in the cab with you ""a dog suppose ""yes queer mongrel with most amazing power of scent would rather have toby 's help than that of the whole detective force of london ""i shall bring he then say i. it be one now ought to be back before three if can get fresh horse ""and say holmes shall see what can learn from mrs. bernstone and from the indian servant who mr. thaddeus tell i sleep in the next garret then shall study the great jones 's method and listen to his not too delicate sarcasm wir sind gewohnt das die menschen verhoehnen be sie nicht verstehen goethe be always pithy "the police have bring cab with they and in this escort miss morstan back to her home after the angelic fashion of woman she have bear trouble with calm face as long as there be some one weak than herself to support and have find she bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper in the cab however she first turn faint and then burst into passion of weeping so sorely have she be try by the adventure of the night she have tell i since that she think i cold and distant upon that journey she little guess the struggle within my breast or the effort of self restraint which hold i back my sympathy and my love go out to she even as my hand have in the garden feel that year of the conventionality of life could not teach i to know her sweet brave nature as have this one day of strange experience yet there be two thought which seal the word of affection upon my lip she be weak and helpless shake in mind and nerve it be to take she at disadvantage to obtrude love upon she at such time worse still she be rich if holmes 's research be successful she would be an heiress be it fair be it honorable that half pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance have bring about might she not look upon i as mere vulgar fortune seeker could not bear to risk that such thought should cross her mind this agra treasure intervene like an impassable barrier between we it be nearly two o'clock when we reach mrs. cecil forrester 's the servant have retire hour ago but mrs. forrester have be so interested by the strange message which miss morstan have receive that she have sit up in the hope of her return she open the door herself middle aged graceful woman and it give i joy to see how tenderly her arm steal round the other 's waist and how motherly be the voice in which she greet she she be clearly no mere pay dependant but an honored friend be introduce and mrs. forrester earnestly beg i to step in and tell she our adventure explain however the importance of my errand and promise faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case as we drive away steal glance back and still seem to see that little group on the step the two graceful cling figure the half open door the hall light shine through stained glass the barometer and the bright stair rod it be soothe to catch even that pass glimpse of tranquil english home in the midst of the wild dark business which have absorb we and the more think of what have happen the wilder and dark it grow review the whole extraordinary sequence of event as rattle on through the silent gas light street there be the original problem that at least be pretty clear now the death of captain morstan the sending of the pearl the advertisement the letter we have have light upon all those event they have only lead we however to deep and far more tragic mystery the indian treasure the curious plan find among morstan 's baggage the strange scene at major sholto 's death the rediscovery of the treasure immediately follow by the murder of the discoverer the very singular accompaniment to the crime the footstep the remarkable weapon the word upon the card correspond with those upon captain morstan 's chart here be indeed labyrinth in which man less singularly endowed than my fellow lodger might well despair of ever find
