have be away in the barge 'd ha think nothin' for many time job have take he as far as gravesend and then if there be much doin' there he might ha stay over but what good be steam launch without coals?""he might have buy some at wharf down the river ""he might sir but it be n't his way many time 've hear he call out at the price they charge for few odd bag besides do n't like that wooden legged man wi his ugly face and outlandish talk what do he want always knockin about here for?""a wooden legged man say holmes with bland surprise "yes sir brown monkey face chap that be call more'n once for my old man it be he that rouse he up yesternight and what be more my man know he be comin for he have steam up in the launch tell you straight sir do n't feel easy in my mind about it ""but my dear mrs. smith say holmes shrug his shoulder you be frightening yourself about nothing how could you possibly tell that it be the wooden legged man who come in the night do n't quite understand how you can be so sure ""his voice sir know his voice which be kind thick and foggy he tap at the winder about three it would be show leg matey say he time to turn out guard my old man wake up jim that be my eld and away they go without so much as word to i could hear the wooden leg clackin on the stone ""and be this wooden legged man alone?""couldn't say be sure sir do n't hear no one else ""i be sorry mrs. smith for want steam launch and have hear good report of the let i see what be she name?""the aurora sir ""ah she be not that old green launch with yellow line very broad in the beam?""no indeed she be as trim little thing as any on the river she be be fresh paint black with two red streak ""thanks hope that you will hear soon from mr. smith be go down the river and if should see anything of the aurora shall let he know that you be uneasy black funnel you say?""no sir black with white band ""ah of course it be the side which be black good morning mrs. smith there be boatman here with wherry watson we shall take it and cross the river "the main thing with people of that sort say holmes as we sit in the sheet of the wherry be never to let they think that their information can be of the slight importance to you if you do they will instantly shut up like an oyster if you listen to they under protest as it be you be very likely to get what you want ""our course now seem pretty clear say i."what would you do then?""i would engage launch and go down the river on the track of the aurora ""my dear fellow it would be colossal task she may have touch at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and greenwich below the bridge there be perfect labyrinth of landing place for mile it would take you day and day to exhaust they if you set about it alone ""employ the police then ""no shall probably call athelney jones in at the last moment he be not bad fellow and should not like to do anything which would injure he professionally but have fancy for work it out myself now that we have go so far ""could we advertise then ask for information from wharfingers?""worse and bad our man would know that the chase be hot at their heel and they would be off out of the country as it be they be likely enough to leave but as long as they think they be perfectly safe they will be in no hurry jones 's energy will be of use to we there for his view of the case be sure to push itself into the daily press and the runaway will think that every one be off on the wrong scent ""what be we to do then ask as we land near millbank penitentiary "take this hansom drive home have some breakfast and get an hour 's sleep it be quite on the card that we may be afoot to night again stop at telegraph office cabby we will keep toby for he may be of use to we yet "we pull up at the great peter street post office and holmes despatch his wire whom do you think that be to he ask as we resume our journey "i be sure do n't know ""you remember the baker street division of the detective police force whom employ in the jefferson hope case?""well say laugh "this be just the case where they might be invaluable if they fail have other resource but shall try they first that wire be to my dirty little lieutenant wiggins and expect that he and his gang will be with we before we have finish our breakfast "it be between eight and nine o'clock now and be conscious of strong reaction after the successive excitement of the night be limp and weary befogged in mind and fatigue in body have not the professional enthusiasm which carry my companion on nor could look at the matter as mere abstract intellectual problem as far as the death of bartholomew sholto go have hear little good of he and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderer the treasure however be different matter that or part of it belong rightfully to miss morstan while there be chance of recover it be ready to devote my life to the one object true if find it it would probably put she forever beyond my reach yet it would be petty and selfish love which would be influence by such thought as that if holmes could work to find the criminal have tenfold strong reason to urge i on to find the treasure bath at baker street and complete change freshen i up wonderfully when come down to our room find the breakfast lay and homes pour out the coffee "here it be say he laugh and point to an open newspaper the energetic jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fix it up between they but you have have enough of the case well have your ham and egg first "i take the paper from he and read the short notice which be head mysterious business at upper norwood ""about twelve o'clock last night say the standard mr. bartholomew sholto of pondicherry lodge upper norwood be find dead in his room under circumstance which point to foul play as far as we can learn no actual trace of violence be find upon mr. sholto 's person but valuable collection of indian gem which the deceased gentleman have inherit from his father have be carry off the discovery be first make by mr. sherlock holmes and dr. watson who have call at the house with mr. thaddeus sholto brother of the deceased by singular piece of good fortune mr. athelney jones the well know member of the detective police force happen to be at the norwood police station and be on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm his trained and experienced faculty be at once direct towards the detection of the criminal with the gratifying result that the brother thaddeus sholto have already be arrest together with the housekeeper mrs. bernstone an indian butler name lal rao and porter or gatekeeper name mcmurdo it be quite certain that the thief or thief be well acquaint with the house for mr. jones 's well know technical knowledge and his power of minute observation have enable he to prove conclusively that the miscreant could not have enter by the door or by the window but must have make their way across the roof of the building and so through trap door into room which communicate with that in which the body be find this fact which have be very clearly make out prove conclusively that it be no mere haphazard burglary the prompt and energetic action of the officer of the law show the great advantage of the presence on such occasion of single vigorous and masterful mind we can not but think that it supply an argument to those who would wish to see our detective more decentralize and so bring into close and more effective touch with the case which it be their duty to investigate ""isn't it gorgeous say holmes grin over his coffee cup what do you think of it?""i think that we have have close shave ourselves of be arrest for the crime ""so do i. would n't answer for our safety now if he should happen to have another of his attack of energy "at this moment there be loud ring at the bell and could hear mrs. hudson our landlady raise her voice in wail of expostulation and dismay "by heaven holmes say half rise believe that they be really after we ""no it be not quite so bad as that it be the unofficial force the baker street irregular "as he speak there come swift pattering of naked foot upon the stair clatter of high voice and in rush dozen dirty and ragged little street arabs there be some show of discipline among they despite their tumultuous entry for they instantly draw up in line and stand face we with expectant face one of their number tall and old than the other stand forward with an air of lounge superiority which be very funny in such disreputable little scarecrow "got your message sir say he and bring 'em on sharp three bob and tanner for ticket ""here you be say holmes produce some silver in future they can report to you wiggins and you to i can not have the house invade in this way however it be just as well that you should all hear the instruction want to find the whereabouts of steam launch call the aurora owner mordecai smith black with two red streak funnel black with white band she be down the river somewhere want one boy to be at mordecai smith 's landing stage opposite millbank to say if the boat come back you must divide it out among yourself and do both bank thoroughly let i know the moment you have news be that all clear?""yes guv'nor say wiggins "the old scale of pay and guinea to the boy who find the boat here be day in advance now off you go he hand they shilling each and away they buzz down the stair and see they moment later stream down the street "if the launch be above water they will find she say holmes as he rise from the table and light his pipe they can go everywhere see everything overhear every one expect to hear before evening that they have spot she in the mean while we can do nothing but await result we can not pick up the broken trail until we find either the aurora or mr. mordecai smith ""toby could eat these scrap dare say be you go to bed holmes?""no be not tired have curious constitution never remember feel tired by work though idleness exhaust i completely be go to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client have introduce we if ever man have an easy task this of ours ought to be wooden legge man be not so common but the other man must should think be absolutely unique ""that other man again!""i have no wish to make mystery of he to you anyway but you must have form your own opinion now do consider the datum diminutive footmark toe never fetter by boot naked foot stone head wooden mace great agility small poison dart what do you make of all this?""a savage exclaim perhaps one of those indians who be the associate of jonathan small ""hardly that say he when first see sign of strange weapon be inclined to think so but the remarkable character of the footmark cause i to reconsider my view some of the inhabitant of the indian peninsula be small man but none could have leave such mark as that the hindoo proper have long and thin foot the sandal wear mohammedan have the great toe well separate from the other because the thong be commonly pass between these little dart too could only be shoot in one way they be from blow pipe now then where be we to find our savage?""south american hazard he stretch his hand up and take down bulky volume from the shelf this be the first volume of gazetteer which be now be publish it may be look upon as the

cannibal feast nice amiable people watson if this fellow have be leave to his own unaided device this affair might have take an even more ghastly turn fancy that even as it be jonathan small would give good deal not to have employ he ""but how come he to have so singular companion?""ah that be more than can tell since however we have already determine that small have come from the andamans it be not so very wonderful that this islander should be with he no doubt we shall know all about it in time look here watson you look regularly do lie down there on the sofa and see if can put you to sleep "he take up his violin from the corner and as stretch myself out he begin to play some low dreamy melodious air his own no doubt for he have remarkable gift for improvisation have vague remembrance of his gaunt limb his earnest face and the rise and fall of his bow then seem to be float peacefully away upon soft sea of sound until find myself in dream land with the sweet face of mary morstan look down upon i it be late in the afternoon before wake strengthen and refresh sherlock holmes still sit exactly as have leave he save that he have lay aside his violin and be deep in book he look across at i as stir and notice that his face be dark and troubled "you have sleep soundly he say fear that our talk would wake you ""i hear nothing answer have you have fresh news then?""unfortunately no confess that be surprised and disappointed expect something definite by this time wiggins have just be up to report he say that no trace can be find of the launch it be provoking check for every hour be of importance ""can do anything be perfectly fresh now and quite ready for another night 's outing ""no we can do nothing we can only wait if we go ourselves the message might come in our absence and delay be cause you can do what you will but must remain on guard ""then shall run over to camberwell and call upon mrs. cecil forrester she ask i to yesterday ""on mrs. cecil forrester ask holmes with the twinkle of smile in his eye "well of course miss morstan too they be anxious to hear what happen ""i would not tell they too much say holmes woman be never to be entirely trust not the good of they "i do not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment shall be back in an hour or two remark "all right good luck but say if you be cross the river you may as well return toby for do n't think it be at all likely that we shall have any use for he now "i take our mongrel accordingly and leave he together with half sovereign at the old naturalist be in pinchin lane at camberwell find miss morstan little weary after her night 's adventure but very eager to hear the news mrs. forrester too be full of curiosity tell they all that we have do suppress however the more dreadful part of the tragedy thus although speak of mr. sholto 's death say nothing of the exact manner and method of it with all my omission however there be enough to startle and amaze they "it be romance cry mrs. forrester an injure lady half million in treasure black cannibal and wooden legged ruffian they take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl ""and two knight errant to the rescue add miss morstan with bright glance at i "why mary your fortune depend upon the issue of this search do n't think that you be nearly excited enough just imagine what it must be to be so rich and to have the world at your feet!"it send little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she show no sign of elation at the prospect on the contrary she give toss of her proud head as though the matter be one in which she take small interest "it be for mr. thaddeus sholto that be anxious she say nothing else be of any consequence but think that he have behave most kindly and honorably throughout it be our duty to clear he of this dreadful and unfounded charge "it be evening before leave camberwell and quite dark by the time reach home my companion 's book and pipe lie by his chair but he have disappear look about in the hope of see note but there be none "i suppose that mr. sherlock holmes have go out say to mrs. hudson as she come up to lower the blind "no sir he have go to his room sir do you know sir sink her voice into an impressive whisper be afraid for his health?""why so mrs. hudson?""well he be that strange sir after you be go he walk and he walk up and down and up and down until be weary of the sound of his footstep then hear he talk to himself and mutter and every time the bell ring out he come on the stairhead with what be that mrs. hudson and now he have slam off to his room but can hear he walk away the same as ever hope he be not go to be ill sir venture to say something to he about cool medicine but he turn on i sir with such look that do n't know how ever get out of the room ""i do n't think that you have any cause to be uneasy mrs. hudson answer have see he like this before he have some small matter upon his mind which make he restless try to speak lightly to our worthy landlady but be myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night still from time to time hear the dull sound of his tread and know how his keen spirit be chafe against this involuntary inaction at breakfast time he look worn and haggard with little fleck of feverish color upon either cheek "you be knock yourself up old man remark hear you march about in the night ""no could not sleep he answer this infernal problem be consume i it be too much to be balk by so petty an obstacle when all else have be overcome know the man the launch everything and yet can get no news have set other agency at work and use every mean at my disposal the whole river have be search on either side but there be no news nor have mrs. smith hear of her husband shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttle the craft but there be objection to that ""or that mrs. smith have put we on wrong scent ""no think that may be dismiss have inquiry make and there be launch of that description ""could it have go up the river?""i have consider that possibility too and there be search party who will work up as far as richmond if no news come to day shall start off myself to morrow and go for the man rather than the boat but surely surely we shall hear something "we do not however not word come to we either from wiggins or from the other agency there be article in most of the paper upon the norwood tragedy they all appear to be rather hostile to the unfortunate thaddeus sholto no fresh detail be to be find however in any of they save that an inquest be to be hold upon the following day walk over to camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the lady and on my return find holmes deject and somewhat morose he would hardly reply to my question and busy himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involve much heating of retort and distilling of vapor end at last in smell which fairly drive i out of the apartment up to the small hour of the morning could hear the clinking of his test tube which tell i that he be still engage in his malodorous experiment in the early dawn wake with start and be surprised to find he stand by my bedside clothe in rude sailor dress with pea jacket and coarse red scarf round his neck "i be off down the river watson say he have be turn it over in my mind and can see only one way out of it it be worth try at all event ""surely can come with you then say i."no you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative be loath to go for it be quite on the card that some message may come during the day though wiggins be despondent about it last night want you to open all note and telegram and to act on your own judgment if any news should come can rely upon you?""most certainly ""i be afraid that you will not be able to wire to i for can hardly tell yet where may find myself if be in luck however may not be go so very long shall have news of some sort or other before get back "i have hear nothing of he by breakfast time on open the standard however find that there be fresh allusion to the business with reference
