to the upper norwood tragedy it remark we have reason to believe that the matter promise to be even more complex and mysterious than be originally suppose fresh evidence have show that it be quite impossible that mr. thaddeus sholto could have be in any way concerned in the matter he and the housekeeper mrs. bernstone be both release yesterday evening it be believe however that the police have clue as to the real culprit and that it be be prosecute by mr. athelney jones of scotland yard with all his well know energy and sagacity further arrest may be expect at any moment ""that be satisfactory so far as it go think i. friend sholto be safe at any rate wonder what the fresh clue may be though it seem to be stereotype form whenever the police have make blunder "i toss the paper down upon the table but at that moment my eye catch an advertisement in the agony column it run in this way:"lost whereas mordecai smith boatman and his son jim leave smith 's wharf at or about three o'clock last tuesday morning in the steam launch aurora black with two red stripe funnel black with white band the sum of five pound will be pay to any one who can give information to mrs. smith at smith 's wharf or at 221b baker street as to the whereabouts of the say mordecai smith and the launch aurora "this be clearly holmes 's do the baker street address be enough to prove that it strike i as rather ingenious because it might be read by the fugitive without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of wife for her miss husband it be long day every time that knock come to the door or sharp step pass in the street imagine that it be either holmes return or an answer to his advertisement try to read but my thought would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill assorted and villainous pair whom we be pursue could there be wonder some radical flaw in my companion 's reasoning might he be suffer from some huge self deception be it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind have build up this wild theory upon faulty premise have never know he to be wrong and yet the keen reasoner may occasionally be deceive he be likely think to fall into error through the over refinement of his logic his preference for subtle and bizarre explanation when plainer and more commonplace one lie ready to his hand yet on the other hand have myself see the evidence and have hear the reason for his deduction when look back on the long chain of curious circumstance many of they trivial in themselves but all tend in the same direction could not disguise from myself that even if holmes 's explanation be incorrect the true theory must be equally outre and startling at three o'clock in the afternoon there be loud peal at the bell an authoritative voice in the hall and to my surprise no less person than mr. athelney jones be show up to i very different be he however from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who have take over the case so confidently at upper norwood his expression be downcast and his bearing meek and even apologetic "good day sir good day say he mr. sherlock holmes be out understand ""yes and can not be sure when he will be back but perhaps you would care to wait take that chair and try one of these cigar ""thank you do n't mind if do say he mop his face with red bandanna handkerchief "and whiskey and soda?""well half glass it be very hot for the time of year and have have good deal to worry and try i you know my theory about this norwood case?""i remember that you express one ""well have be oblige to reconsider it have my net draw tightly round mr. sholto sir when pop he go through hole in the middle of it he be able to prove an alibi which could not be shake from the time that he leave his brother 's room he be never out of sight of some one or other so it could not be he who climb over roof and through trap door it be very dark case and my professional credit be at stake should be very glad of little assistance ""we all need help sometimes say i."your friend mr. sherlock holmes be wonderful man sir say he in husky and confidential voice he be man who be not to be beat have know that young man go into good many case but never see the case yet that he could not throw light upon he be irregular in his method and little quick perhaps in jump at theory but on the whole think he would have make most promising officer and do n't care who know it have have wire from he this morning by which understand that he have get some clue to this sholto business here be the message "he take the telegram out of his pocket and hand it to i it be date from poplar at twelve o'clock go to baker street at once it say if have not return wait for i be close on the track of the sholto gang you can come with we to night if you want to be in at the finish ""this sound well he have evidently pick up the scent again say i."ah then he have be at fault too exclaim jones with evident satisfaction even the good of we be throw off sometimes of course this may prove to be false alarm but it be my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip but there be some one at the door perhaps this be he "a heavy step be hear ascend the stair with great wheezing and rattle as from man who be sorely put to it for breath once or twice he stop as though the climb be too much for he but at last he make his way to our door and enter his appearance correspond to the sound which we have hear he be an aged man clothe in seafare garb with an old pea jacket button up to his throat his back be bow his knee be shaky and his breathing be painfully asthmatic as he lean upon thick oaken cudgel his shoulder heave in the effort to draw the air into his lung he have colored scarf round his chin and could see little of his face save pair of keen dark eye overhang by bushy white brow and long gray side whisker altogether he give i the impression of respectable master mariner who have fall into year and poverty "what be it my man ask he look about he in the slow methodical fashion of old age "is mr. sherlock holmes here say he "no but be act for he you can tell i any message you have for he ""it be to he himself be to tell it say he "but tell you that be act for he be it about mordecai smith 's boat?""yes know well where it be an know where the man he be after be an know where the treasure be know all about it ""then tell i and shall let he know ""it be to he be to tell it he repeat with the petulant obstinacy of very old man "well you must wait for he ""no no ai n't goin' to lose whole day to please no one if mr. holmes ai n't here then mr. holmes must find it all out for himself do n't care about the look of either of you and wo n't tell word "he shuffle towards the door but athelney jones get in front of he "wait bit my friend say he you have important information and you must not walk off we shall keep you whether you like or not until our friend return "the old man make little run towards the door but as athelney jones put his broad back up against it he recognize the uselessness of resistance "pretty sort treatment this he cry stamp his stick come here to see gentleman and you two who never see in my life seize i and treat i in this fashion!""you will be none the bad say we shall recompense you for the loss of your time sit over here on the sofa and you will not have long to wait "he come across sullenly enough and seat himself with his face rest on his hand jones and resume our cigar and our talk suddenly however holmes 's voice break in upon we "i think that you might offer i cigar too he say we both start in our chair there be holme sit close to we with an air of quiet amusement "holme exclaim you here but where be the old man?""here be the old man say he hold out heap of white hair here he be wig whisker eyebrow and all think my disguise be pretty good but hardly expect that it would stand that test ""ah you rogue cry jones highly delighted you would have make an actor and rare one you have the proper workhouse cough and those weak leg of your be worth ten pound week think know the glint of your eye though you do n't get away from we so easily you see ""i have be work in that get up all day say he light his cigar you see good many of the criminal class begin to know i especially since our friend here take to publish some of my case so can only go on the war path under some simple disguise like this you get my wire?""yes that be what bring i here ""how have your case prospered?""it have all come to nothing have have to release two of my prisoner and there be no evidence against the other two ""never mind we shall give you two other in the place of they but you must put yourself under my order you be welcome to all the official credit but you must act on the line that point out be that agreed?""entirely if you will help i to the man ""well then in the first place shall want fast police boat steam launch to be at the westminster stairs at seven o'clock ""that be easily manage there be always one about there but can step across the road and telephone to make sure ""then shall want two stanch man in case of resistance ""there will be two or three in the boat what else?""when we secure the man we shall get the treasure think that it would be pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belong let she be the first to open it eh watson?""it would be great pleasure to i ""rather an irregular proceeding say jones shake his head however the whole thing be irregular and suppose we must wink at it the treasure must afterwards be hand over to the authority until after the official investigation ""certainly that be easily manage one other point should much like to have few detail about this matter from the lip of jonathan small himself you know like to work the detail of my case out there be no objection to my have an unofficial interview with he either here in my room or elsewhere as long as he be efficiently guarded?""well you be master of the situation have have no proof yet of the existence of this jonathan small however if you can catch he do n't see how can refuse you an interview with he ""that be understand then?""perfectly be there anything else?""only that insist upon your dining with we it will be ready in half an hour have oyster and brace of grouse with something little choice in white wine watson you have never yet recognize my merit as housekeeper "our meal be merry one holme could talk exceedingly well when he choose and that night he do choose he appear to be in state of nervous exaltation have never know he so brilliant he speak on quick succession of subject on miracle play on medieval pottery on stradivarius violin on the buddhism of ceylon and on the war ship of the future handle each as though he have make special study of it his bright humor mark the reaction from his black depression of the precede day athelney jones prove to be sociable soul in his hour of relaxation and face his dinner with the air of bon vivant for myself feel elated at the thought that we be near the end of our task and catch something of holmes 's gaiety none of we allude during dinner to the cause which have bring we together when the cloth be clear holmes glance at his watch and fill up three glass with port one bumper say he to the success of our little expedition and now it be high time we be off have you pistol watson?""i have my old service revolver in my desk ""you have well take it then it be well to be prepared see that the cab be at the door order it for half past six "it be little past seven before we reach the westminster wharf and find our launch await we holme eye it critically "is there anything to mark it as police boat?""yes that green lamp at the side ""then take it off "the small change be make we step on board and the rope be cast off jones holmes and sit in the stern there be one man at the rudder one to tend the engine and two burly police inspector forward "where to ask jones "to the tower tell they to stop opposite jacobson 's yard "our craft be evidently very fast one we shoot past the long line of loaded barge as though they be stationary holme smile with satisfaction as we overhaul river steamer and leave she behind we "we ought to be able to catch anything on the river he say "well hardly that but there be not many launch to beat we ""we shall have to catch the aurora and she have name for be clipper will tell you how the land lie watson you recollect how annoyed be at be balk by so small thing?""yes ""well give my mind thorough rest by plunge into chemical analysis one of our great statesman have say that change of work be the good rest so it be when have succeed in dissolve the hydrocarbon which be at work at come back to our problem of the sholtos and think the whole matter out again my boy have be up the river and down the river without result the launch be not at any landing stage or wharf nor have it return yet it could hardly have be scuttle to hide their trace though that always remain as possible hypothesis if all else fail know this man small have certain degree of low cunning but do not think he capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse that be usually product of high education then reflect that since he have certainly be in london some time as we have evidence that he maintain continual watch over pondicherry lodge he could hardly leave at moment 's notice but would need some little time if it be only day to arrange his affair that be the balance of probability at any rate ""it seem to i to be little weak say i. it be more probable that he have arrange his affair before ever he set out upon his expedition ""no hardly think so this lair of his would be too valuable retreat in case of need for he to give it up until he be sure that he could do without it but second consideration strike i jonathan small must have feel that the peculiar appearance of his companion however much he may have top coat he would give rise to gossip and possibly be associate with this norwood tragedy he be quite sharp enough to see that they have start from their head quarter under cover of darkness and he would wish to get back before it be broad light now it be past three o'clock accord to mrs. smith when they get the boat it would be quite bright and people would be about in an hour or so therefore argue they do not go very far they pay smith well to hold his tongue reserve his launch for the final escape and hurry to their lodging with the treasure box in couple of night when they have time to see what view the paper take and whether there be any suspicion they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at gravesend or in the downs where no doubt they have already arrange for passage to america or the colonies ""but the launch they could not have take that to their lodging ""quite so argue that the launch must be no great way off in spite of its invisibility then put myself in the place of small and look at it as man of his capacity would he would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at wharf would make pursuit easy if the police do happen to get on his track how then could he conceal the launch and yet have she at hand when want wonder what should do myself if be in his shoe could only think of one way of do it might land the launch over to some boat builder or repairer with direction to make trifling change in she she would then be remove to his shed or yard and so be effectually conceal while at the same time could have she at few hour notice ""that seem simple enough ""it be just these very simple thing which be extremely liable to be overlook however determine to act on the idea start at once in this harmless seaman 's rig and inquire at all the yard down the river draw blank at fifteen but at the sixteenth jacobson 's learn that the aurora have be hand over to they two day ago by wooden legged man with some trivial direction as to her rudder there ai n't naught amiss with her rudder say the foreman there she lie with the red streak at that moment who should come down but mordecai smith the miss owner he be rather the bad for liquor should not of course have know he but he bellow out his name and the name of his launch want she to night at eight o'clock say he eight o'clock sharp mind for have two gentleman who wo n't be keep wait they have evidently pay he well for he be very flush of money chuck shilling about to the man follow he some distance but he subside into an ale house so go back to the yard and happen to pick up one of my boy on the way station he as sentry over the launch he be to stand at water 's edge and wave his handkerchief to we when they start we shall be lie off in the stream and it will be strange thing if we do not take man treasure and all ""you have plan it all very neatly whether they be the right man or not say jones but if the affair be in my hand should have have body of police in jacobson 's yard and arrest they when they come down ""which would have be never this man small be pretty shrewd fellow he would send scout on ahead and if anything make he suspicious lie snug for another week ""but you might have stick to mordecai smith and so be lead to their hiding place say i."in that case should have waste my day think that it be hundred to one against smith know where they live as long as he have liquor and good pay why should he ask question they send he message what to do no think over every possible course and this be the good "while this conversation have be proceed we have be shoot the long series of bridge which span the thames as we pass the city the last ray of the sun be gild the cross upon the summit of st. paul 's it be twilight before we reach the tower "that be jacobson 's yard say holmes point to bristle of mast and rig on the surrey side cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighter he take pair of night glass from his pocket and gaze some time at the shore see my sentry at his post he remark but no sign of handkerchief ""suppose we go down stream short way and lie in wait for they say jones eagerly we be all eager by this time even the policeman and stoker who have very vague idea of what be go forward "we have no right to take anything for grant holme answer it be certainly ten to one that they go down stream but we can not be certain from this point we can see the entrance of the yard and they can hardly see we it will be clear night and plenty of light we must stay where we be see how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight ""they be come from work in the yard ""dirty look rascal but suppose every one have some little immortal spark conceal about he you would not think it to look at they there be no priori probability about it strange enigma be man!""some one call he soul conceal in an animal suggest "winwood reade be good upon the subject say holmes he remark that while the individual man be an insoluble puzzle in the aggregate he become mathematical certainty you can for example never foretell what any one man will do but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to individual vary but percentage remain constant so say the statistician but do see handkerchief surely there be white flutter over yonder ""yes it be your boy cry can see he plainly ""and there be the aurora exclaim holmes and go like the devil full speed ahead engineer make after that launch with the yellow light by heaven shall never forgive myself if she prove to have the heel of us!"she have slip unseen through the yard entrance and pass behind two or three small craft so that she have fairly get her speed up before we see she now she be fly down the stream near in to the shore go at tremendous rate jones look gravely at she and shake his head "she be very fast he say doubt if we shall catch she ""we must catch she cry holmes between his tooth heap it on stoker make she do all she can if we burn the boat we must have them!"we be fairly after she now the furnace roar and the powerful engine whiz and clanked like great metallic heart her sharp steep prow cut through the river water and send two roll wave to right and to left of we with every throb of the engine we spring and quiver like living thing one great yellow lantern in our bow throw long flicker funnel of light in front of we right ahead dark blur upon the water show where the aurora lie and the swirl of white foam behind she speak of the pace at which she be go we flash past barge steamer merchant vessel in and out behind this one and round the other voice hail we out of the darkness
