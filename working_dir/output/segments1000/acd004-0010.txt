see the bearded fellow clean their harness while their wife would come out for gossip with their needlework in their hand and their long black shadow stream across the yard the air be full of the clack of their voice and the merry prattling of child in strange contrast to the flash of arm and constant warlike challenge from the wall above "methinks company of school lad could hold this place
