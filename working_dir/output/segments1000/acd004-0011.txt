stricken with year and slow of speech so that she get small profit from his teaching would have you do what you can with she and with agatha my young tire woman and with dorothy pierpont "and so alleyne find himself not only choose as squire to knight but also as squire to three damosel which be even far from the part which he have think to play in the world yet he could but agree to do what he might and so go forth from the castle hall with his face flush and his head in whirl at the thought of the strange and perilous path which his foot be destine to tread and now there come time of stir and bustle of furbish of arm and clang of hammer from all the southland county fast spread the tiding from thorpe to thorpe and from castle to castle that the old game be afoot once more and the lion and lily to be in the field with the early spring great news this for that fierce old country whose trade for generation have be war her export archer and her import prisoner for six year her son have chafe under an unwonted peace now they fly to their arm as to their birthright the old soldier of crecy of nogent and of poictiers be glad to think that they might hear the war trumpet once more and gladder still be the hot youth who have chafe for year under the martial tale of their sire to pierce the great mountain of the south to fight the tamer of the fiery moors to follow the great captain of the age to find sunny cornfield and vineyard when the marche of picardy and normandy be as rare and bleak as the jedburgh forest here be golden prospect for race of warrior from sea to sea there be string of bow in the cottage and clang of steel in the castle nor do it take long for every stronghold to pour forth its cavalry and every hamlet its footman through the late autumn and the early winter every road and country lane resound with nakir and trumpet with the neigh of the war horse and the clatter of march man from the wrekin in the welsh marche to the cotswolds in the west or butser in the south there be no hill top from which the peasant might not have see the bright shimmer of arm the toss and flutter of plume and of pensil from bye path from woodland clearing or from wind moor side track these little rivulet of steel unite in the large road to form broad stream grow ever full and large as it approach the near or most commodious seaport and there all day and day after day there be bustle and crowding and labor while the great ship load up and one after the other spread their white pinion and dart off to the open sea amid the clash of cymbal and rolling of drum and lusty shout of those who go and of those who wait from orwell to the dart there be no port which do not send forth its little fleet gay with streamer and bunting as for joyous festival thus in the season of the wane day the might of england put forth on to the water in the ancient and populous county of hampshire there be no lack of leader or of soldier for service which promise either honor or profit in the north the saracen 's head of the brocas and the scarlet fish of the de roches be wave over strong body of archer from holt woolmer and harewood forest de borhunte be up in the east and sir john de montague in the west sir luke de ponynges sir thomas west sir maurice de bruin sir arthur lipscombe sir walter ramsey and stout sir oliver buttesthorn be all march south with levy from andover arlesford odiham and winchester while from sussex come sir john clinton sir thomas cheyne and sir john fallislee with troop of pick man at arm make for their port at southampton great of all the muster however be that of twynham castle for the name and the fame of sir nigel loring draw towards he the keen and boldest spirit all eager to serve under so valiant leader archer from the new forest and the forest of bere billman from the pleasant country which be water by the stour the avon and the itchen young cavalier from the ancient hampshire house all be push for christchurch to take service under the banner of the five scarlet rose and now could sir nigel have show the bachelle of land which the law of rank require he might well have cut his fork pennon into square banner and take such following into the field as would have support the dignity of banneret but poverty be heavy upon he his land be scant his coffer empty and the very castle which cover he the holding of another sore be his heart when he see rare bowman and war harden spearman turn away from his gate for the lack of the money which might equip and pay they yet the letter which aylward have bring he give he power which he be not slow to use in it sir claude latour the gascon lieutenant of the white company assure he that there remain in his keep enough to fit out hundred archer and twenty man at arm which join to the three hundred veteran companion already in france would make force which any leader might be proud to command carefully and sagaciously the veteran knight choose out his man from the swarm of volunteer many an anxious consultation he hold with black simon sam aylward and other of his more experienced follower as to who should come and who should stay by all saints day however ere the last leave have flutter to earth in the wilverley and holmesley glade he have fill up his full number and muster under his banner as stout following of hampshire forester as ever twang their war bow twenty man at arm too well mounted and equip form the cavalry of the party while young peter terlake of fareham and walter ford of botley the martial son of martial sire come at their own cost to wait upon sir nigel and to share with alleyne edricson the duty of his squireship yet even after the enrolment there be much to be do ere the party could proceed upon its way for armor sword and lance there be no need to take much forethought for they be to be have both well and cheap in bordeaux than in england with the long bow however it be different yew stave indeed might be get in spain but it be well to take enough and to spare with they then three spare cord should be carry for each bow with great store of arrow head besides the brigandine of chain mail the wad steel cap and the brassart or arm guard which be the proper equipment of the archer above all the woman for mile round be hard at work cut the white surcoat which be the badge of the company and adorn they with the red lion of st. george upon the centre of the breast when all be complete and the muster call in the castle yard the old soldier of the french war be fain to confess that he have never look upon well equipped or more warlike body of man from the old knight with his silk jupon sit his great black war horse in the front of they to hordle john the giant recruit who lean carelessly upon huge black bow stave in the rear of the six score fully half have see service before while fair sprinkling be man who have follow the war all their life and have hand in those battle which have make the whole world ring with the fame and the wonder of the island infantry six long week be take in these preparation and it be close on martinmas ere all be ready for start nigh two month have alleyne edricson be in castle twynham month which be fate to turn the whole current of his life to divert it from that dark and lonely bourne towards which it tend and to guide it into free and more sunlit channel already he have learn to bless his father for that wise provision which have make he seek to know the world ere he have venture to renounce it for it be different place from that which he have picture very different from that which he have heard describe when the master of the novice hold forth to his charge upon the ravening wolf who lurk for they beyond the peaceful fold of beaulieu there be cruelty in it doubtless and lust and sin and sorrow but be there not virtue to atone robust positive virtue which do not shrink from temptation which hold their own in all the rough blast of the work day world how colorless by contrast appear the sinlessness which come from inability to sin the conquest which be attain by fly from the enemy monk breed as he be alleyne have native shrewdness and mind which be young enough to form new conclusion and to outgrow old one he could not fail to see that the man with whom he be throw in contact rough tongue fierce and quarrelsome as they be be yet of deep nature and of more service in the world than the ox eyed brother who rise and eat and sleep from year 's end to year 's end in their own narrow stagnant circle of existence abbot berghersh be good man but how be he well than this kindly knight who live as simple life hold as lofty and inflexible an ideal of duty and do with all his fearless heart whatever come to his hand to do in turn from the service of the one to that of the other alleyne could not feel that he be lower his aim in life true that his gentle and thoughtful nature recoil from the grim work of war yet in those day of martial order and militant brotherhood there be no gulf fix betwixt the priest and the soldier the man of god and the man of the sword might without scandal be unite in the same individual why then should he mere clerk have scruple when so fair chance lie in his way of carry out the spirit as well as the letter of his father 's provision much struggle it cost he anxious spirit questioning and midnight praying with many doubt and misgiving but the issue be that ere he have be three day in castle twynham he have take service under sir nigel and have
