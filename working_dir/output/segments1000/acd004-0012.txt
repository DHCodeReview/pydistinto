worthy knight young supple and active with all the pent energy from year of pure and healthy living it be not long before he could manage his horse and his weapon well enough to earn an approve nod from critical man at arm or to hold his own against terlake and ford his fellow servitor but be there no other consideration which sway he from the cloister towards the world so complex be the human spirit that it can itself scarce discern the deep spring which impel it to action yet to alleyne have be open now side of life of which he have be as innocent as child but one which be of such deep import that it could not fail to influence he in choose his path woman in monkish precept have be the embodiment and concentration of what be dangerous and evil focus whence spread all that be to be dread and avoid so defiling be their presence that true cistercian might not raise his eye to their face or touch their finger tip under ban of church and fear of deadly sin yet here day after day for an hour after none and for an hour before vesper he find himself in close communion with three maiden all young all fair and all therefore doubly dangerous from the monkish standpoint yet he find that in their presence he be conscious of quick sympathy pleasant ease ready response to all that be most gentle and good in himself which fill his soul with vague and new find joy and yet the lady maude loring be no easy pupil to handle an old and more world wise man might have be puzzle by her vary mood her sudden prejudice her quick resentment at all constraint and authority do subject interest she be there space in it for either romance or imagination she would fly through it with her subtle active mind leave she two fellow student and even her teacher toil behind she on the other hand be there dull patience need with steady toil and strain of memory no single fact could by any driving be fix in her mind alleyne might talk to she of the story of old god and hero of gallant deed and lofty aim or he might hold forth upon moon and star and let his fancy wander over the hidden secret of the universe and he would have rapt listener with flushed cheek and eloquent eye who could repeat after he the very word which have fall from his lip but when it come to almagest and astrolabe the counting of figure and reckoning of epicycle away would go her thought to horse and hound and vacant eye and listless face would warn the teacher that he have lose his hold upon his scholar then he have but to bring out the old romance book from the priory with befingered cover of sheepskin and gold letter upon purple ground to entice her wayward mind back to the path of learning at time too when the wild fit be upon she she would break into pertness and rebel openly against alleyne 's gentle firmness yet he would jog quietly on with his teaching take no heed to her mutiny until suddenly she would be conquer by his patience and break into self reviling hundred time strong than her fault demand it chance however that on one of these morning when the evil mood be upon she agatha the young tire woman think to please her mistress begin also to toss her head and make tart rejoinder to the teacher

mother have so order it say alleyne "by our lady and withouten disrespect quoth terlake it be in my mind that her lady mother be more fitted to lead company to storming than to have the upbringing of

behind be the little clump of steel clothe horseman their lance raise with long pensil droop down the oaken shaft so silent and still be they that they might have be metal sheathe statue be it not for the occasional quick impatient stamp of their charger or the rattle of chamfron against neck plate as they toss and strained spear 's length in front of they sit the spare and long limbe figure of black simon the norwich fighting man his fierce deep line face frame in steel and the silk guidon mark with the five scarlet rose slant over his right shoulder all round in the edge of the circle of the light stand the castle servant the soldier who be to form the garrison and little knot of woman who sob in their apron and call shrilly to their name saint to watch over the wat or will or peterkin who have turn his hand to the work of war the young squire be lean forward gaze at the stirring and martial scene when he hear short quick gasp at his shoulder and there be the lady maude with her hand to her heart lean up against the wall slender and fair like half pluck lily her face be turn away from he but he could see by the sharp intake of her breath that she be weep bitterly "alas alas he cry all unnerved at the sight why be it that you be so sad lady?""it be the sight of these brave man she answer and to think how many of they go and how few be like to find their way back have see it before when be little maid in the year of the prince 's great battle remember then how they muster in the bailey even as they do now and my lady mother hold i in her arm at this very window that might see the show ""please god you will see they all back ere another year be out say he she shake her head look round at he with flushed cheek and eye that sparkle in the lamp light oh
