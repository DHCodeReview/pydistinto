kiss and reap the virtue the yellow cog have now shoot out from the narrow water of the solent and be plunge and roll on the long heave of the open channel the wind blow freshly from the east with very keen edge to it and the great sail belly roundly out lay the vessel over until the water hiss beneath her lee bulwark broad and ungainly she flounder from wave to wave dip her round bow deeply into the blue roller and send the white flake of foam in spatter over her deck on her larboard quarter lie the two dark galley which have already hoist sail and be shoot out from freshwater bay in swift pursuit their double line of oar give they vantage which could not fail to bring they up with any vessel which trust to sail alone high and bluff the english cog long black and swift the pirate galley like two fierce lean wolf which have see lordly and unsuspecting stag walk past their forest lair "shall we turn my fair lord or shall we carry on ask the master shipman look behind he with anxious eye "nay we must carry on and play the part of the helpless merchant ""but your pennon they will see that we have two knight with we ""yet it would not be to knight 's honor or good name to lower his pennon let they be and they will think that we be wine ship for gascony or that we bear the wool bale of some mercer of the staple ma foi but they be very swift they swoop upon we like two

limb at every plunge and swoop of the galley "by st. paul say sir nigel and by the help of st. george and our lady it will be very strange thing if our black headed friend do not himself swing thence ere he be many hour old but what be that upon the other galley?""it be the red cross of genoa this spade beard be very noted captain and it be his boast that there be no seaman and no archer in the world who can compare with those who serve the doge boccanegra ""that we shall prove say goodwin hawtayne but it would be well ere they close with we to raise up the mantlet and pavise as screen against their bolt he shout hoarse order and his seamen work swiftly and silently heighten the bulwark and strengthen they the three ship 's anchor be at sir nigel 's command carry into the waist and tie to the mast with twenty foot of cable between each under the care of four seaman eight other be station with leather water bag to quench any fire arrow which might come aboard while other be send up the mast to lie along the yard and drop stone or shoot arrow as the occasion serve "let they be supply with all that be heavy and weighty in the ship say sir nigel "then we must send they up sir

jagged rock which be balance on the spoon shape end of the long wooden lever the other hold the loop of the rope which would release the catch and send the unwieldy missile hurtle through the air so for an instant they stand show hard and clear against the white sail behind they the next redcap have fall across the stone with an arrow between his rib and the other strike in the leg and in the throat be writhe and splutter upon the ground as he topple backwards he have loose the spring and the huge beam of wood swinge round with tremendous force cast the corpse of his comrade so close to the english ship that its mangle and distorted limb graze their very stern as to the stone it glance off obliquely and fall midway between the vessel roar of cheering and of laughter break from the rough archer and seaman at the sight answer by yell of rage from their pursuer "lie low me enfant cry aylward motion with his left hand they will learn wisdom they be bring forward shield and mantlet we shall have some pebble about our ear ere long "the three vessel have be sweep swiftly westward the cog still well to the front although the galley be slowly draw in upon either quarter to the left

bow quarrel stick quiver in the board at the same instant the man stumble forward upon his knee and lie lifeless upon the deck blood stain feather jut out from his back as alleyne stoop to raise he the air seem to be alive with the sharp zip zip of the bolt and he could hear they patter on the deck like apple at tree shake "raise two more mantlet by the poop lanthorn say sir nigel quietly "and another man to the tiller cry the master shipman "keep they in play aylward with ten of your man the knight continue and let ten of sir oliver 's bowman do as much for the genoese have no mind as yet to show they how much they have to fear from we "ten pick shot under aylward stand in line across the broad deck and it be lesson to the young squire who have see nothing of war to note how orderly and how cool be these old soldier how quick the command and how prompt the carrying out ten move like one their comrade crouch beneath the bulwark with many rough jest and many scrap of criticism or advice high wat high put thy body into it will forget not the wind hal so run the muttered chorus while high above it rise the sharp twanging of the string the hiss of the shaft and the short draw your arrow nick your arrow shoot wholly together from the master bowman and now both mangonel be at work from the galley but so cover and protect that save at the moment of discharge no glimpse could be catch of they huge brown rock from the genoese sing over their head and plunge sullenly into the slope of wave another from the norman whiz into the waist break the back of horse and crash its way through the side of the vessel two other fly together tear great gap in the st. christopher upon the sail and brush three of sir oliver 's man at arm from the forecastle the master shipman look at the knight with troubled face "they keep their distance from we say he our archery be over good and they will not close what defence can we make against the stones?""i think may trick they the knight answer cheerfully and pass his order to the archer instantly five of they throw up their hand and fall prostrate upon the deck one have already be slay by bolt so that there be but four upon their foot "that should give they heart say sir nigel eye the galley which creep along on either side with slow measured swing of their great oar the water swirling and foam under their sharp stem "they still hold aloof cry hawtayne "then down with two more shout their leader that will do ma foi but they come to our lure like chick to the fowler to your arm man the pennon behind i and the squire round the pennon stand fast with the anchor in the waist and be ready for cast now blow out the trumpet and may god 's benison be with the honest men!"as he speak roar of voice and roll of drum come from either galley and the water be lash into spray by the hurried beat of hundred oar down they swoop one on the right one on the left the side and shroud black with man and bristle with weapon in heavy cluster they hang upon the forecastle all ready for spring face white face brown face yellow and face black fair norseman swarthy italians fierce rover from the levant and fiery moors from the barbary states of all hue and country and mark solely by the common stamp of wild beast ferocity rasp up on either side with oar trail to save they from snap they pour in live torrent with horrid yell and shrill whoop upon the defenceless merchantman but wilder yet be the cry and shriller still the scream when there rise up from the shadow of those silent bulwark the long line of the english bowman and the arrow whiz in deadly sleet among the unprepared masse upon the pirate deck from the high side of the cog the bowman could shoot straight down at range which be so short as to enable cloth yard shaft to pierce through mail coat or to transfix shield though it be an inch thick of toughen wood one moment alleyne see the galley 's poop crowd with rush figure wave arm exultant face the next it be blood smear shamble with body pile three deep upon each other the living cowering behind the dead to shelter themselves from that sudden storm blast of death on either side the seaman whom sir nigel have choose for the purpose have cast their anchor over the side of the galley so that the three vessel lock in an iron grip lurch heavily forward upon the swell and now set in fell and fierce fight one of thousand of which no chronicler have speak and no poet sing through all the century and over all those southern water nameless man have fight in nameless place their sole monument protect coast and an unravaged country side fore and aft the archer have clear the galley deck but from either side the rover have pour down into the waist where the seaman and bowman be push back and so mingle with their foe that it be impossible for their comrade above to draw string to help they it be wild chaos where axe and sword rise and fall while englishman norman and italian stagger and reel on deck which be cumber with body and slippery with blood the clang of blow the cry of the stricken the short deep shout of the islander and the fierce whoop of the rover rise together in deafening tumult while the breath of the pant man go up in the wintry air like the smoke from furnace the giant tete noire tower above his fellow and clothe from head to foot in plate of proof lead on his boarder wave huge mace in the air with which he strike to the deck every man who approach he on the other side spade beard dwarf in height but of great breadth of shoulder and length of arm have cut road almost to the mast with three score genoese man at arm close at his heel between these two formidable assailant the seaman be be slowly wedge more closely together until they stand back to back under the mast with the rover rage upon every side of they but help be close at hand sir oliver buttesthorn with his man at arm have swarm down from the forecastle while sir nigel with his three squire black simon aylward hordle john and score more throw themselves from the poop and hurl themselves into the thickest of the fight alleyne as in duty bind keep his eye fix ever on his lord and press forward close at his heel often have he hear of sir nigel 's prowess and skill with all knightly weapon but all the tale that have reach his ear fall far short of the real quickness and coolness of the man it be as if the devil be in he for he spring here and spring there now thrust and now cut catch blow on his shield turn they with his blade stoop under the swing of an axe spring over the sweep of sword so swift and so erratic that the man who brace himself for blow at he might find he six pace off ere he could bring it down three pirate have fall before he and he have wound spade beard in the neck when the norman giant spring at he from the side with slash blow from his deadly mace sir nigel stoop to avoid it and at the same instant turn thrust from the genoese swordsman but his foot slip in pool of blood he fall heavily to the ground alleyne spring in front of the norman but his sword be shatter and he himself beat to the ground by second blow from the ponderous weapon ere the pirate chief could repeat it however john 's iron grip fall upon his wrist and he find that for once he be in the hand of strong man than himself fiercely he strove to disengage his weapon but hordle john bend his arm slowly back until with sharp crack like breaking stave it turn limp in his grasp and the mace drop from the nerveless finger in vain he try to pluck it up with the other hand back and back still his foeman bend he until with roar of pain and of fury the giant clang his full length upon the board while the glimmer of knife before the bar of his helmet warn he that short would be his shrift if he move cow and dishearten by the loss of their leader the normans have give back and be now stream over the bulwark on to their own galley drop dozen at time on to her deck but the anchor still hold they in its crooked claw and sir oliver with fifty man be hard upon their heel now too the archer have room to draw their bow once more and great stone from the yard of the cog come thunder and crash among the fly rover here and there they rush with wild scream and curse dive under the sail crouch behind boom huddle into corner like rabbit when the ferret be upon they as helpless and as hopeless they be stern day and if the honest soldier too poor for ransom have no prospect of mercy upon the battle field what ruth be there for sea robber the enemy of humankind take in the very deed with proof of their crime still swinge upon their yard arm but the fight have take new and strange turn upon the other side spade beard and his man have give slowly back hard press by sir nigel aylward black simon and the poop guard foot by foot the italian have retreat his armor run blood at every joint his shield split his crest shorn his voice fall away to mere gasping and croaking yet he face his foeman with dauntless courage dash in spring back sure footed steady handed with point which seem to menace three at once beat back on to the deck of his own vessel and closely follow by dozen englishmen he disengage himself from they run swiftly down the deck spring back into the cog once more cut the rope which hold the anchor and be back in an instant among his crossbow man at the same time the genoese sailor thrust with their oar against the side of the cog and rapidly widen rift appear between the two vessel "by st. george cry ford we be cut off from sir nigel ""he be lose gasp terlake come let we spring for it the two youth jump with all their strength to reach the depart galley ford 's foot reach the edge of the bulwark and his hand clutch rope he swing himself on board terlake fall short crash in among the oar and bound off into the sea alleyne stagger to the side be about to hurl himself after he but hordle john drag he back by the girdle "you can scarce stand lad far less jump say he see how the blood rip from your bassinet ""my place be by the flag cry alleyne vainly struggle to break from the other 's hold "bide here man you would need wing ere you could reach sir nigel 's side "the vessel be indeed so far apart now that the genoese could use the full sweep of their oar and draw away rapidly from the cog "my god but it be noble fight shout big john clap his hand they have clear the poop and they spring into the waist well strike my lord well strike aylward see to black simon how he storm among the shipman but this spade beard be gallant warrior he rally his man upon the forecastle he hath slay an archer ha my lord be upon he look to it alleyne see to the whirl and glitter of it!""by heaven sir nigel be down cry the squire "up roar john it be but feint he bear he back he drive he to the side ah by our lady his sword be through he they cry for mercy down go the red cross and up spring simon with the scarlet roses!"the death of the genoese leader do indeed bring the resistance to an end amid thunder of cheer from cog and from galley the fork pennon flutter upon the forecastle and the galley sweeping round come slowly back as the slave who row it learn the wish of their new master the two knight have come aboard the cog and the grappling having be throw off the three vessel now move abreast through all the storm and rush of the fight alleyne have be aware of the voice of goodwin hawtayne the master shipman with his constant hale the bowline veer the sheet and strange it be to he to see how swiftly the blood stain sailor turn from the strife to the rope and back now the cog 's head be turn francewards and the shipman walk the deck peaceful master mariner once more "there be sad scath do to the cog sir nigel say he here be hole in the side two ell across the sail split through the centre and the wood as bare as friar 's poll in good sooth know not what shall say to master witherton when see the itchen once more ""by st. paul it would be very sorry thing if we suffer you to be the bad of this day 's work say sir nigel you shall take these galley back with you and master witherton may sell
