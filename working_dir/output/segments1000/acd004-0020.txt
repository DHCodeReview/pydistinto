""how chance it at poictiers good master aylward ask one of the young archer lean upon his elbow with his eye fix respectfully upon the old bowman 's rugged face "aye aylward tell we of it cry hordle john "here be to old samkin aylward shout several at the further end of the room wave their blackjack in the air "ask he say aylward modestly nod towards black simon he see more than do and yet by the
