will scarce be light for these course pray you gentleman to take your place that we may see whether this stranger 's deed be as bold as his word "the unknown knight have sit like statue of steel look neither to the right nor to the left during these preliminary he have change from the horse upon which he have ride and bestrode the black charger which his squire have lead beside he his immense breadth his stern compose appearance and the mode in which he handle his shield and his lance be enough in themselves to convince the thousand of critical spectator that he be dangerous opponent aylward who stand in the front row of the archer with simon big john and other of the company have be criticise the proceeding from the commencement with the ease and freedom of man who have spend his life under arm and have learn in hard school to know at glance the point of horse and his rider he stare now at the stranger with wrinkle brow and the air of man who be strive to stir his memory "by my hilt have see the thick body of he before to day yet can not call to mind where it could have be at nogent belike or be it at auray mark i lad this man will prove to be one of the good lance of france and there be no well in the world ""it be but child 's play this poking game say john would fain try my hand at it for by the black rood think that it might be amend ""what then would you do john ask several "there be many thing which might be do say the forester thoughtfully methink that would begin by break my spear ""so they all strive to do ""nay but not upon another man 's shield would break it over my own knee ""and what the well for that old beef and bone ask black simon "so would turn what be but lady 's bodkin of weapon into very handsome club ""and then john?""then would take the other 's spear into my arm or my leg or where it please he well to put it and would dash out his brain with my club ""by my ten finger bone old john say aylward would give my feather bed to see you at spear running this be most courtly and gentle sport which you have devise ""so it seem to i say john seriously or again one might seize the other round the middle pluck he off his horse and bear he to the pavilion there to hold he to ransom ""good cry simon amid roar of laughter from all the archer round by thomas of kent we shall make camp marshal of thee and thou shalt draw up rule for our jousting but john who be it that you would uphold in this knightly and pleasing fashion?""what mean you?""why john so strong and strange tilter must fight for the brightness of his lady 's eye or the curve of her eyelash even as sir nigel do for the lady loring ""i know not about that say the big archer scratch his head in perplexity since mary hath play i false can scarce fight for she ""yet any woman will serve ""there be my mother then say john she be at much pain at my upbringing and by my soul will uphold the curve of her eyelash for it tickleth my very heart root to think of she but who be here?""it be sir william beauchamp he be valiant man but fear that he be scarce firm enough upon the saddle to bear the thrust of such tilter as this stranger promise to be "aylward 's word be speedily justify for even as he speak the two knight meet in the centre of the list beauchamp strike his opponent shrewd blow upon the helmet but be meet with so frightful thrust that he whirl out of his saddle and roll over and over upon the ground sir thomas percy meet with little well success for his shield be split his vambrace tear and he himself wound slightly in the side lord audley and the unknown knight strike each other fairly upon the helmet but while the stranger sit as firm and rigid as ever upon his charger the englishman be bent back to his horse 's cropper by the weight of the blow and have gallop half way down the list ere he could recover himself sir thomas wake be beat to the ground with battle axe that be the weapon which he have select and have to be carry to his pavilion these rapid success gain one after the other over four celebrated warrior work the crowd up to pitch of wonder and admiration thunder of applause from the english soldier as well as from the citizen and peasant show how far the love of brave and knightly deed could rise above the rivalry of race "by my soul john cry the prince with his cheek flush and his eye shine this be man of good courage and great hardiness could not have think that there be any single arm upon earth which could have overthrow these four champion ""he be indeed as have say sire knight from whom much honor be to be gain but the low edge of the sun be wet and it will be beneath the sea ere long ""here be sir nigel loring on foot and with his sword say the prince have hear that he be fine swordsman ""the fine in your army sire chando answer yet doubt not that he will need all his skill this day "as he speak the two combatant advance from either end in full armor with their two handed sword slope over their shoulder the stranger walk heavily and with measured stride while the english knight advance as briskly as though there be no iron shell to weigh down the freedom of his limb at four pace distance they stop eye each other for moment and then in an instant fall to work with clatter and clang as though two sturdy smith be busy upon their anvil up and down go the long shine blade round and round they circle in curve of glimmer light crossing meeting disengage with flash of spark at every parry here and there bound sir nigel his head erect his jaunty plume flutter in the air while his dark opponent send in crash blow upon blow follow fiercely up with cut and with thrust but never once get past the practise blade of the skilled swordsman the crowd roar with delight as sir nigel would stoop his head to avoid blow or by some slight movement of his body allow some terrible thrust to glance harmlessly past he suddenly however his time come the frenchman whirl up his sword show for an instant chink betwixt his shoulder piece and the rerebrace which guard his upper arm in dash sir nigel and out again so swiftly that the eye could not follow the quick play of his blade but trickle of blood from the stranger 's shoulder and rapidly widen red smudge upon his white surcoat show where the thrust have take effect the wound be however but slight one and the frenchman be about to renew his onset when at sign from the prince chandos throw down his baton and the marshal of the list strike up the weapon and bring the contest to an end "it be time to check it say the prince smile for sir nigel be too good man for i to lose and by the five holy wound if one of those cut come home should have fear for our champion what think you pedro?""i think edward that the little man be very well able to take care of himself for my part should wish to see so well match pair fight on while drop of blood remain in their vein ""we must have speech with he such man must not go from my court without rest or sup bring he hither chandos and certe if the lord loring hath resign his claim upon this goblet it be right and proper that this cavali should carry it to france with he as sign of the prowess that he have show this day "as he speak the knight errant who have remount his warhorse gallop forward to the royal stand with silken kerchief bind round his wound arm the set sun cast ruddy glare upon his burnish arm and send his long black shadow streaming behind he up the level clearing pull up his steed he slightly incline his head and sit in the stern and composed fashion with which he have bear himself throughout heedless of the applauding shout and the flutter of kerchief from the long line of brave man and of fair woman who be look down upon he "sir knight say the prince we have all marvel this day at this great skill and valor with which god have be pleased to endow you would fain that you should tarry at our court for time at least until your hurt be heal and your horse rest ""my hurt be nothing sire nor be my horse weary return the stranger in deep stern voice "will you not at least hie back to bordeaux with we that you may drain cup of muscadine and sup at our table?""i will neither drink your wine nor sit at your table return the other bear no love for you or for your race and there be nought that wish at your hand until the day when see the last sail which bear you back to your island vanish away against the western sky ""these be bitter word sir knight say prince edward with an angry frown "and they come from bitter heart answer the unknown knight how long be it since there have be peace in my hapless country where be the steading and orchard and vineyard which make france fair where be the city which make she great from providence to burgundy we be beset by every prowling hireling in christendom who rend and tear the country which you have leave too weak to guard her own marche be it not by word that man may ride all day in that unhappy land without see thatch upon roof or hear the crow of cock do not one fair kingdom content you that you should strive so for this other one which have no love for you pardieu true frenchman 's word may well be bitter for bitter be his lot and bitter his thought as he ride through his thrice unhappy country ""sir knight say the prince you speak like brave man and our cousin of france be happy in have cavalier who be so fit to uphold his cause either with tongue or with sword but if you think such evil of we how come it that you have trust yourself to we without warranty or safe conduct?""because know that you would be here sire have the man who sit upon your right be ruler of this land have indeed think twice before look to he for aught that be knightly or generous with soldierly salute he wheel round his horse and gallop down the list disappear amid the dense crowd of footman and of horseman who be stream away from the scene of the tournament "the insolent villain cry pedro glare furiously after he have see man 's tongue tear from his jaw for less would it not be well even now edward to send horseman to hale he back bethink you that it may be one of the royal house of france or at least some knight whose loss would be heavy blow to his master sir william felton you be well mounted gallop after the caitiff pray you ""do so sir william say the prince and give he this purse of hundred noble as sign of the respect which bear for he for by st. george he have serve his master this day even as would wish liegeman of mine to serve i so say the prince turn

master 's chamber to wait upon he in his dressing and to curl his hair he find he already up and very busily at work he sit at table by the window deer hound on one side of he and lurcher on the other his foot tuck away under the trestle on which he sit and his tongue in his cheek with the air of man who be much perplexed sheet of vellum lie upon the board in front of he and he hold pen in his hand with which he have be scribble in rude schoolboy hand so many be the blot however and so numerous the scratch and erasure that he have at last give it up in despair and sit with his single uncovered eye cock upwards at the ceiling as one who wait upon inspiration "by saint paul he cry as alleyne enter you be the man who will stand by i in this matter have be in sore need of you alleyne ""god be with you my fair lord the squire answer trust that you have take no hurt from all that you have go through yesterday ""nay feel the fresher for it alleyne it have ease my joint which be somewhat stiff
