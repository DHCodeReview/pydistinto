circle of red flickering light which play over the little group of wayfarer and show up every line and shadow upon their face sir nigel sit with elbow upon knee and chin upon hand his patch still cover one eye but his other shine like star while the ruddy light gleam upon his smooth white head ford be seat at his left his lip part his eye stare and fleck of deep color on either cheek his limb all rigid as one who fear to move on the other side the famous french captain lean back in his chair litter of nut shell upon his lap his huge head half bury in cushion while his eye wander with an amused gleam from his dame to the staring enrapture englishmen then last of all that pale clear cut face that sweet clear voice with its high thrilling talk of the deathlessness of glory of the worthlessness of life of the pain of ignoble joy and of the joy which lie in all pain which lead to noble end still as the shadow deepen she speak of valor and virtue of loyalty honor and fame and still they sit drink in her word while the fire burn down and the red ash turn to gray "by the sainted ives cry du guesclin at last it be time that we speak of what we be to do this night for can not think that in this wayside auberge there be fit quarter for an honorable company "sir nigel give long sigh as he come back from the dream of chivalry and hardihood into which this strange woman 's word have waft he care not where sleep say he but these be indeed somewhat rude lodging for this fair lady ""what content my lord content i quoth she perceive sir nigel that you be under vow she add glance at his covered eye "it be my purpose to attempt some small deed he answer "and the glove be it your lady's?""it be indeed my sweet wife's ""who be doubtless proud of you ""say rather of she quoth he quickly god he know that be not worthy to be her humble servant it be easy lady for man to ride forth in the light of day and do his devoir when all man have eye for he but in woman 's heart there be strength and truth which ask no praise and can but be know to he whose treasure it be "the lady tiphaine smile across at her husband you have often tell i bertrand that there be very gentle

marche ""by the virgin when he learn that you have come to draw away these rascal he will be very blithe to look upon your face inn keeper here be ten gold piece what be over and above your reckoning you may take off from your charge to the next needy knight who come this way come then for it grow late and the horse be stamp in the roadway "the lady tiphaine and her spouse spring upon their steed without set foot to stirrup and away they jingle down the white moonlit highway with sir nigel at the lady 's bridle arm and ford spear 's length behind they alleyne have linger for an instant in the passage and as he do so there come wild outcry from chamber upon the left and out there run aylward and john laugh together like two schoolboy who be bent upon prank at sight of alleyne they slunk past he with somewhat of shame face air and spring upon their horse gallop after their party the hubbub within the chamber do not cease however but rather increase with yell of moi me amis moi camarade moi l'honorable champion de l'eveque de montaubon la recousse de l'eglise sainte so shrill be the outcry that both the inn keeper and alleyne with every varlet within hearing rush wildly to the scene of the uproar it be indeed singular scene which meet their eye the room be long and lofty one stone floor and bare with fire at the further end upon which great pot be boil deal table run down the centre with wooden wine pitcher upon it and two horn cup some way from it be small table with single beaker and break wine bottle from the heavy wooden rafter which form the roof there hang row of hook which hold up side of bacon joint of smoked beef and string of onion for winter use in the very centre of all these upon the large hook of all there hang fat little red face man with enormous whisker kick madly in the air and claw at rafter ham and all else that be within hand grasp the huge steel hook have be pass through the collar of his leather jerkin and there he hang like fish on line writhe twisting and scream but utterly unable to free himself from his extraordinary position it be not until alleyne and the landlord have mount on the table that they be able to lift he down when he sink gasp with rage into seat and roll his eye round in every direction "has he go quoth he "gone who?""he the man with the red head the giant man ""yes say alleyne he hath go ""and come not back?""no ""the well for he cry the little man with long sigh of relief mon dieu what be not the champion of the bishop of montaubon ah could have descend could have come down ere he flee then you would have see you would have behold spectacle then there would have be one rascal the less upon earth ma foi yes!""good master pelligny say the landlord these gentleman have not go very fast and have horse in the stable at your disposal for would rather have such bloody doing as you threaten outside the four wall of mine auberge ""i hurt my leg and can not ride quoth the bishop 's champion strain sinew on the day that slay the three man at castelnau ""god save you master pelligny cry the landlord it must be an awesome thing to have so much blood upon one 's soul and yet do not wish to see so valiant man mishandle and so will for friendship 's sake ride after this englishman and bring he back to you ""you shall not stir cry the champion seize the inn keeper in convulsive grasp have love for you gaston and would not bring your house into ill repute nor do such scath to these wall and chattel as must befall if two such man as this englishman and fall to work here ""nay think not of i

mind shall not know he by his great paw and his red head ma foi yes!""and may ask sir say alleyne why it be that you call yourself champion of the bishop of montaubon?""you may ask aught which it be become to i to answer the bishop hath need of champion because if any cause be set to test of combat it would scarce become his office to go down into the list with leather and shield and cudgel to exchange blow with any varlet he look around he then for some try fight man some honest smiter who can give blow or take one it be not for i to say how far he hath succeed but it be sooth that he who think that he hath but to do with the bishop of montaubon find himself face to face with francois poursuivant d'amour pelligny "at this moment there be clatter of hoofs upon the road and varlet by the door cry out that one of the englishmen be come back the champion look wildly about for some corner of safety and be clamber up towards the window when ford 's voice sound from without call upon alleyne to hasten or he might scarce find his way bid adieu to landlord and to champion therefore he set off at gallop and soon overtook the two archer "a pretty thing this john say he thou wilt have holy church upon you if you hang her champion upon iron hook in an inn kitchen ""it be do without think he answer apologetically while aylward burst into shout of laughter "by my hilt mon petit say he you would have laugh also could you have see it for this man be so swollen with pride that he would neither drink with we nor sit at the same table with we nor as much as answer question but must need talk to the varlet all the time that it be well there be peace and that he have slay more englishman than there be tag to his doublet our good old john could scarce lay his tongue to french enough to answer he so he must need reach out his great hand to he and place he very gently where you see he but we must on for can scarce hear their hoofs upon the road ""i think that can see they yet say ford peer down the moonlit road "pardieu yes now they ride forth from the shadow and yonder dark clump be the castle of villefranche en avant camarade or sir nigel may reach the gate before we but hark me amis what sound be that?"as he speak the hoarse blast of horn be hear from some wood upon the right an answer call ring forth upon their left and hard upon it two other from behind they "they be the horn of swine herd quoth aylward though why they blow they so late can not tell ""let we on then say ford and the whole party set their spur to their horse soon find themselves at the castle of villefranche where the drawbridge have already be lower and the portculli raise in response to the summon of du guesclin sir tristram de rochefort seneschal of auvergne and lord of villefranche be

life be spend in raid and outfall upon the brabanters late comer flayer free companion and rove archer who wander over his province at time he would come back in triumph and dozen corpse swinge from the summit of his keep would warn evil doer that there be still law in the land at other his venture be not so happy and he and his troop would spur it over the drawbridge with clatter of hoofs hard at their heel and whistle of arrow about their ear hard he be of hand and hard of heart hate by his foe and yet not love by those whom he protect for twice he have be take prisoner and twice his ransom have be wring by dint of blow and torture out of the starve peasant and ruin farmer wolf or watch dog it be hard to say from which the sheep have most to fear the castle of villefranche be harsh and stern as its master broad moat high outer wall turrete at the corner with great black keep tower above all so it lie before they in the moonlight by the light of two flambeaux protrude through the narrow slit shape opening at either side of the ponderous gate they catch glimpse of the glitter of fierce eye and of the gleam of the weapon of the guard the sight of the two head eagle of du guesclin however be passport into any fortalice in france and ere they have pass the gate the old border knight came run forwards with hand out throw to greet his famous countryman nor be he less glad to see sir nigel when the englishman 's errand be explain to he for these archer have be sore thorn in his side and have route two expedition which he have send against they happy day it

from time to time and pass his broad brown finger through his crisp curly black hair with the air of man who be perplex in his mind "these folk here say the knight of bohemia they do not seem too well fed ""ah canaille cry the lord of villefranche you would scarce credit it and yet it be sooth that when be take at poictier it be all that my wife and foster brother could do to raise the money from
