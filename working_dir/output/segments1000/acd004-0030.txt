side of it over which peep the lofty mountain the distant peak of the south and the vast altabisca which tower high above they and cast its black shadow from left to right across the valley from where they now stand they could look forward down long vista of beech wood and jagged rock strew wilderness all white with snow to where the pass open out upon the upland beyond behind they they could still catch glimpse of the gray plain of gascony and could see her river gleam like coil of silver in the sunshine as far as eye could see from among the rocky gorge and the bristle of the pine wood there come the quick twinkle and glitter of steel while the wind bring with it sudden distant burst of martial music from the great host which roll by every road and by path towards the narrow pass of roncesvalles on the cliff on either side might also be see the flash of arm and the waving of pennon where the force of navarre look down upon the army of stranger who pass through their territory "by saint paul say sir nigel blink up at they think that we have much to hope for from these cavalier for they cluster very thickly upon our flank pass word to the man aylward that they unsle their bow for have no doubt that there be some very worthy gentleman yonder who may give we some opportunity for honorable advancement ""i hear that the prince hath the king of navarre as hostage say alleyne and it be say that he hath swear to put he to death if there be any attack upon we ""it be not so that war be make when good king edward first turn his hand to it say sir nigel sadly ah alleyne fear that you will never live to see such thing for the mind of man be more set upon money and gain than of old by saint paul it be noble sight when two great army would draw together upon certain day and all who have vow would ride forth to discharge themselves of it what noble spear running have not see and even in an humble way have part in when cavalier would run course for the easing of their soul and for the love of their lady never bad word have for the french for though have ride twenty time up to their array have never yet fail to find some very gentle and worthy knight or squire who be willing to do what he might to enable i to attempt some small feat of arm then when all cavalier have be satisfied the two army would come to hand stroke and fight right merrily until one or other have the vantage by saint paul it be not our wo nt in those day to pay gold for the opening of pass nor would we hold king as hostage lest his people come to thrust with we in good sooth if the war be to be carry out in such fashion then it be grief to i that ever come away from castle twynham for would not have leave my sweet lady have not think that there be deed of arm to be do ""but surely my fair lord say alleyne you have do some great feat of arm since we leave the lady loring ""i can not call any to mind answer sir nigel "there be the taking of the sea rover and the holding of the keep against the jacks ""nay nay say the knight these be not feat of arm but mere wayside venture and the chance of travel by saint paul if it be not that these hill be over steep for pommers would ride to these cavalier of navarre and see if there be not some among they who would help i to take this patch from mine eye it be sad sight to see this very fine pass which my own company here could hold against an army and yet to ride through it with as little profit as though it be the lane from my kennel to the avon "all morning sir nigel ride in very ill humor with his company tramp behind he it be toilsome march over broken ground and through snow which come often as high as the knee yet ere the sun have begin to sink they have reach the spot where the gorge open out on to the upland of navarre and could see the tower of pampeluna jut up against the southern sky line here the company be quarter in scatter mountain hamlet and alleyne spend the day look down upon the swarming army which pour with gleam of spear and flaunt of standard through the narrow pass "hola mon gar say aylward seat himself upon boulder by his side this be indeed fine sight upon which it be good to look and man might go far ere he would see so many brave man and fine horse by my hilt our little lord be wroth because we have come peacefully through the pass but will warrant he that we have fight enow ere we turn our face northward again it be say that there be four score thousand man behind the king of spain with du guesclin and all the good lance of france who have swear to shed their heart 's blood ere this pedro come again to the throne ""yet our own army be great one say alleyne "nay there be but seven and twenty thousand man chando hath persuade the prince to leave many behind and indeed think that he be right for there be little food and less water in these part for which we be bind man without his meat or horse without his fodder be like wet bow string fit for little but voila mon petit here come chandos and his company and there be many pensil and banderole among yonder squadron which show that the good blood of england be ride under his banner "whilst aylward have be speak strong column of archer have defile through the pass beneath they they be follow by banner bearer who hold high the scarlet wedge upon silver field which proclaim the presence of the famous warrior he ride himself within spear's length of his standard clothe from neck to foot in steel but drape in the long linen gown or parement which be destine to be the cause of his death his plume helmet be carry behind he by his body squire and his head be cover by small purple cap from under which his snow white hair curl downward to his shoulder with his long beak like nose and his single gleaming eye which shine brightly from under thick tuft of grizzle brow he seem to alleyne to have something of the look of some fierce old bird of prey for moment he smile as his eye light upon the banner of the five rose wave from the hamlet but his course lie for pampeluna and he ride on after the archer close at his heel come sixteen squire all choose from the high family and behind they ride twelve hundred english knight with gleam of steel and tossing of plume their harness jingling their long straight sword clank against their stirrup iron and the beat of their charger hoofs like the low deep roar of the sea upon the shore behind they march six hundred cheshire and lancashire archer bear the badge of the audleys follow by the famous lord audley himself with the four valiant squire dutton of dutton delves of doddington fowlehurst of crewe and hawkestone of wainehill who have all win such glory at poictiers two hundred heavily armed cavalry ride behind the audley standard while close at their heel come the duke of lancaster with glitter train herald tabarde with the royal arm ride three deep upon cream colored charger in front of he on either side of the young prince ride the two seneschal of aquitaine sir guiscard d'angle and sir stephen cossington the one bear the banner of the province and the other that of saint george away behind he as far as eye could reach roll the far stretch unbroken river of steel rank after rank and column after column with wave of plume glitter of arm tossing of guidon and flash and flutter of countless armorial device all day alleyne look down upon the change scene and all day the old bowman stand by his elbow point out the crest of famous warrior and the arm of noble house here be the gold mullet of the pakingtons the sable and ermine of the mackworths the scarlet bar of the wakes the gold and blue of the grosvenors the cinque foil of the cliftons the annulet of the musgraves the silver pinion of the beauchamps the crosse of the molineaux the bloody chevron of the woodhouses the red and silver of the worsleys the sword of the clarks the boars'-head of the lucies the crescent of the boyntons and the wolf and dagger of the lipscomb so through the sunny winter day the chivalry of england pour down through the dark pass of roncesvalles to the plain of spain it be on monday that the duke of lancaster 's division pass safely through the pyrenees on the tuesday there be bitter frost and the ground ring like iron beneath the foot of the horse yet ere evening the prince himself with the main battle of his army have pass the gorge and unite with his vanguard at pampeluna with he ride the king of majorca the hostage king of navarre and the fierce don pedro of spain whose pale blue eye gleam with sinister light as they rest once more upon the distant peak of the land which have disown he under the royal banner ride many bold gascon baron and many hot blooded islander here be the high steward of aquitaine of saintonge of la rochelle of quercy of limousin of agenois of poitou and of bigorre with the banner and muster of their province here also be the valiant earl of angus sir thomas banaster with his garter over his greave sir nele loring second cousin to sir nigel and long column of welsh footman who march under the red banner of merlin from dawn to sundown the long train wound through the pass their breath reek up upon the frosty air like the steam from cauldron the weather be less keen upon the wednesday and the rear guard make good their passage with the bombard and the wagon train free companion and gascon make up this portion of the army to the number of ten thousand man the fierce sir hugh calverley with his yellow mane and the rugged sir robert knolles with their war harden and veteran company of english bowman head the long column while behind they come the turbulent band of the bastard of breteuil nandon de bagerant one eyed camus black ortingo la nuit and other whose very name seem to smack of hard hand and ruthless deed with they also be the pick of the gascon chivalry the old duc d'armagnac his nephew lord d'albret brood and scowl over his wrong the giant oliver de clisson the captal de buch pink of knighthood the sprightly sir perducas d'albret the red bearded lord d'esparre and long train of needy and grasp border noble with long pedigree and short purse who have come down from their hill side stronghold all hunger for the spoil and the ransom of spain by the thursday morning the whole army be encamp in the vale of pampeluna and the prince have call his council to meet he in the old palace of the ancient city of navarre whilst the council be sit in pampeluna the white company having encamp in neighboring valley close to the company of la nuit and of black ortingo be amuse themselves with sword play wrestling and shoot at the shield which they have place upon the hillside to serve they as butts the young archer with their coat of mail throw aside their brown or flaxen hair toss in the wind and their jerkin turn back to give free play to their brawny chest and arm stand in line each loose his shaft in turn while johnston aylward black simon and half score of the elder lounge up and down with critical eye and word of rough praise or of curt censure for the marksman behind stand knot of gascon and brabant crossbowman from the company of ortingo and of la nuit lean upon their unsightly weapon and watch the practice of the englishmen "a good shot hewett good shot say old johnston to young bowman who stand with his bow in his left hand gaze with parted lip after his fly shaft you see she find the ring as know she would from the moment that your string twang ""loose it easy steady and yet sharp say aylward by my hilt mon gar it be very well when you do but shoot at shield but when there be man behind the shield and he ride at you with wave of sword and glint of eye from behind his vizor you may find he less easy mark ""it be mark that have find before now answer the young bowman "and shall again camarade doubt not but hola johnston who be this who hold his bow like crow keeper?""it be silas peterson of horsham do not wink with one eye and look with the other silas and do not hop and dance after you shoot with your tongue out for that will not speed it upon its way stand straight and firm as god make you move not the bow arm and steady with the draw hand!""i faith say black simon be spearman myself and be more fit for hand stroke than for such work as this yet have spend my day among bowman and have see many brave shaft speed will not say but that we have some good marksman here and that this company would be account fine body of archer at any time or place yet do not see any man who bend so strong bow or shoot as true shaft as those whom have know ""you say sooth say johnston turn his seam and grizzle face upon the man at arm see yonder he add point to bombard which lie within the camp there be what hath do scath to good bowmanship with its filthy soot and foolish roar mouth wonder that true knight like our prince should carry such scurvy thing in his train robin thou red head lurden how oft must tell thee not to shoot straight with quarter wind blow across the mark?""by these ten finger bone there be some fine bowman at the intaking of calais say aylward well remember that on occasion of an outfall genoan raise his arm over his mantlet and shake it at we hundred pace from our line there be twenty who loose shaft at he and when the man be afterwards slay it be find that he have take eighteen through his forearm ""and can call to mind remark johnston that when the great cog christopher which the french have take from we be moor two hundred pace from the shore two archer little robin withstaff and elias baddlesmere in four shot each cut every strand of her hempen anchor cord so that she well nigh come upon the rock ""good shooting faith rare shooting say black simon but have see you johnston and you samkin aylward and one or two other who be still with we shoot as well as the good be it not you johnston who take the fat ox at finsbury butt against the pick of london town?"a sunburnt and black eyed brabanter have stand near the old archer lean upon large crossbow and listen to their talk which have be carry on in that hybrid camp dialect which both nation could understand he be squat bull necked man clothe in the iron helmet mail tunic and woollen gambesson of his class jacket with hang sleeve slash with velvet at the neck and wrist show that he be man of some consideration an under officer or file leader of his company "i can not think say he why you english should be so fond of your six foot stick if it amuse you to bend it well and good but why should strain and pull when my little moulinet will do all for i and well than can do it for myself?""i have see good shooting with the prod and with the latch say aylward but by my hilt camarade with all respect to you and to your bow think that be but woman 's weapon which woman can point and loose as easily as man ""i know not about that answer the brabanter but this know that though have serve for fourteen year have never yet see an englishman do aught with the long bow which could not do well with my arbalest by the three king would even go far and say that have do thing with my arbalest which no englishman could do with his long bow ""well say mon gar cry aylward good cock have ever brave call now have shoot little of late but there be johnston here who will try round with you for the honor of the company ""and will lay gallon of jurancon wine upon the long bow say black simon though have rather for my own drinking that it be quart of twynham ale ""i take both your challenge and your wager say the man of brabant throw off his jacket and glancing keenly about he with his black twinkle eye can not see any fitting mark for care not to waste bolt upon these shield which drunken boor could not miss at village kermesse ""this be perilous man whisper an english man at arm pluck at aylward 's sleeve he be the good marksman of all the crossbow company and it be he who bring down the constable de bourbon at brignais fear that your man will come by little honor with he ""yet have see johnston shoot these twenty year and will not flinch from it how say you old war hound will you not have flight shot or two with this springald?""tut tut aylward say the old bowman my day be past and it be for the young one to hold what we have gain take it unkindly of thee samkin that thou shouldst call all eye thus upon break bowman who could once shoot fair shaft let i feel that bow wilkins it be scotch bow see for the upper nock be without and the low within by the black rood it be good piece of yew well nocked well string well waxed and very joyful to the feel think even now that might hit any large and goodly mark with bow like this turn thy quiver to i aylward love an ash arrow pierce with cornel wood for roving shaft ""by my hilt and so do cry aylward these three gander wing shaft be such ""so see comrade it have be my wo nt to choose saddle back feather for dead shaft and swine back for smooth flier will take the two of they ah samkin lad the eye grow dim and the hand less firm as the year pass ""come then be you not ready say the brabanter who have watch with ill conceal impatience the slow and methodic movement of his antagonist "i will venture rover with you or try long butts or hoyle say old johnston to my mind the long bow be well weapon than the arbal but it may be ill for i to prove it ""so think quoth the other with sneer he draw his moulinet from his girdle and fix it to the windlass he draw back the powerful double cord until it have click into the catch then from his quiver he draw short thick quarrel which he place with the utmost care upon the groove word have spread of what be go forward and the rival be already surround not only by the english archer of the company but by hundred of arbalestier and man at arm from the band of ortingo and la nuit to the latter of which the brabanter belong "there be mark yonder on the hill say he mayhap you can discern it ""i see something answer johnston shade his eye with his hand but it be very long shoot ""a fair shoot fair shoot stand aside arnaud lest you find bolt through your gizzard now comrade take no flight shot and give you the vantage of watch my shaft "as he speak he raise his arbalest to his shoulder and be about to pull the trigger when large gray stork flap heavily into view skim over the brow of the hill and then soar up into the air to pass the valley its shrill and pierce cry draw all eye upon it and as it come near dark spot which circle above it resolve itself into peregrine falcon which hover over its head poise itself from time to time and watch its chance of close with its clumsy quarry nearer and nearer come the two bird all absorb in their own contest the stork wheel upwards the hawk still flutter above it until they be not hundred pace from the camp the brabanter raise his weapon to the sky and there come the short deep twang of his powerful string his bolt strike the stork just where its wing meet the body and the bird whirl aloft in last convulsive flutter before fall wound and flap to the earth roar of applause burst from the crossbowman but at the instant that the bolt strike its mark old johnston who have stand listlessly with arrow on string bend his bow and speed shaft through the body of the falcon whip the other from his belt he send it skim some few foot from the earth with so true an aim that it strike and transfix the stork for the second time ere it could reach the ground deep cheste shout of delight burst from the archer at the sight of this double feat and aylward dance with joy throw his arm round the old marksman and embrace he with such vigor that their mail tunic clang again "ah camarade he cry you shall have stoup with i for this what then old dog would not the hawk please thee but thou must have the stork as well oh to my heart again!""it be pretty piece of yew and well string say johnston with twinkle in his deep set gray eye even an old broken bowman might find the clout with bow like this ""you have do very well remark the brabanter in surly voice but it seem to i that you have not yet show yourself to be well marksman than for have strike that at which aim and by the three king no man can do more ""it would ill beseem i to claim to be well marksman answer johnston for have hear great thing of your skill do but wish to show that the long bow could do that which an arbal could not do for you could not with your moulinet have your string ready to speed another shaft ere the bird drop to the earth ""in that you have vantage say the crossbowman by saint james it be now my turn to show you where my weapon have the well of you pray you to draw flight shaft with all your strength down the valley that we may see the length of your shoot ""that be very strong prod of yours say johnston shake his grizzle head as he glance at the thick arch and powerful string of his rival 's arbal have little doubt that you can overshoot i and yet have see bowman who could send cloth yard arrow far than you could speed quarrel ""so have hear remark the brabanter and yet it be strange thing that these wondrous bowman be never where chance to be pace out the distance with wand at every five score and do you arnaud stand at the fifth wand to carry back my bolt to i "a line be measure down the valley
