which if reduce from its former size be still ample to preserve the dignity of his family far he have become man of experience be count brave among brave man have win the esteem and confidence of her father and above all have be listen to by he when he tell he the secret of his love as to the gaining of knighthood in such stir time it be no great matter for brave squire of gentle birth to aspire to that honor he would leave his bone among these spanish ravine or he would do some deed which would call the eye of man upon he alleyne be still seat on the rock his grief and his joy drift swiftly over his mind like the shadow of cloud upon sunlit meadow when of sudden he become conscious of low deep sound which came boom up to he through the fog close behind he he could hear the murmur of the bowman the occasional burst of hoarse laughter and the champing and stamp of their horse behind it all however come that low pitch deep toned hum which seem to come from every quarter and to fill the whole air in the old monastic day he remember to have hear such sound when he have walk out one windy night at bucklershard and have listen to the long wave break upon the shingly shore here however be neither wind nor sea and yet the dull murmur rise ever louder and strong out of the heart of the rolling sea of vapor he turn and run to the camp shout an alarm at the top of his voice it be but hundred pace and yet ere he have cross it every bowman be ready at his horse 's head and the group of knight be out and listen intently to the ominous sound "it be great body of horse say sir william felton and they be ride very swiftly hitherward ""yet they must be from the prince 's army remark sir richard causton for they come from the north ""nay say the earl of angus it be not so certain for the peasant with whom we speak last night say that it be rumor that don tello the spanish king 's brother have ride with six thousand choose man to beat up the prince 's camp it may be that on their backward road they have come this way ""by st. paul cry sir nigel think that it be even as you say for that same peasant have sour face and shift eye as one who bear we little good will doubt not that he have bring these cavalier upon we ""but the mist cover we say sir simon burley we have yet time to ride through the further end of the pass ""were we troop of mountain goat we might do so answer sir william felton but it be not to be pass by company of horseman if these be indeed don tello and his man then we must bide where we be and do what we can to make they rue the day that they find we in their path ""well spoken william cry sir nigel in high delight if there be so many as have be say then there will be much honor to be gain from they and every hope of advancement but the sound have cease and fear that they have go some other way ""or mayhap they have come to the mouth of the gorge and be marshal their rank hush and hearken for they be no great way from we "the company stand peer into the dense fog wreath amidst silence so profound that the dripping of the water from the rock and the breathing of the horse grow loud upon the ear suddenly from out the sea of mist come the shrill sound of neigh follow by long blast upon bugle "it be spanish call my fair lord say black simon it be use by their pricker and huntsman when the beast hath not flee but be still in its lair ""by my faith say sir nigel smile if they be in humor for venerie we may promise they some sport ere they sound the mort over we but there be hill in the centre of the gorge on which we might take our stand ""i mark it yester night say felton and no well spot could be find for our purpose for it be very steep at the back it be but bow shot to the left and indeed can see the shadow of it "the whole company lead their horse pass across to the small hill which loom in front of they out of the mist it be indeed admirably design for defence for it slope down in front all jagged and boulder strew while it fall away in sheer cliff of hundred foot or more on the summit be small uneven plateau with stretch across of hundred pace and depth of half as much again "unloose the horse say sir nigel we have no space for they and if we hold our own we shall have horse and to spare when this day 's work be do nay keep yours my fair sir for we may have work for they aylward johnston let your man form harrow on either side of the ridge sir oliver and you my lord angus give you the right wing and the left to you sir simon and to you sir richard causton and sir william felton will hold the centre with our man at arm now order the rank and fle wide the banner for our soul be god 's and our body the king 's and our sword for saint george and for england!"sir nigel have scarcely speak when the mist seem to thin in the valley and to shred away into long ragged cloud which trail from the edge of the cliff the gorge in which they have camp be mere wedge shape cleft among the hill three quarter of mile deep with the small rugged rise upon which they stand at the further end and the brown crag wall it in on three side as the mist part and the sun break through it gleam and shimmer with dazzle brightness upon the armor and headpiece of vast body of horseman who stretch across the barranca from one cliff to the other and extend backwards until their rear guard be far out upon the plain beyond line after line and rank after rank they choke the neck of the valley with long vista of tossing pennon twinkle lance wave plume and streaming banderole while the curvet and gambade of the charger lend constant motion and shimmer to the glittering many color mass yell of exultation and forest of wave steel through the length and breadth of their column announce that they could at last see their entrap enemy while the swell note of hundred bugle and drum mix with the clash of moorish cymbal break forth into proud peal of martial triumph strange it be to these gallant and sparkling cavalier of spain to look upon this handful of man upon the hill the thin line of bowman the knot of knight and man at arm with armor rust and discolor from long service and to learn that these be indeed the soldier whose fame and prowess have be the camp fire talk of every army in christendom very still and silent they stand lean upon their bow while their leader take counsel together in front of they no clang of bugle rise from their stern rank but in the centre wave the leopard of england on the right the ensign of their company with the rose of loring and on the left over three score of welsh bowman there float the red banner of merlin with the boars'-head of the buttesthorns gravely and sedately they stand beneath the morning sun wait for the onslaught of their foeman "by saint paul say sir nigel gaze with pucker eye down the valley there appear to be some very worthy people among they what be this golden banner which wave upon the left?""it be the ensign of the knights of calatrava answer felton "and the other upon the right?""it mark the knights of santiago and see by his flag that their grand master ride at their head there too be the banner of castile amid yonder sparkle squadron which head the main battle there be six thousand man at arm with ten squadron of slinger as far as may judge their number ""there be frenchmen among they my fair lord remark black simon can see the pennon of de couvette de brieux saint pol and many other who strike in against we for charles of blois ""you be right say sir william for can also see they there be much spanish blazonry also if could but read it don diego you know the arm of your own land who be they who have do we this honor?"the spanish prisoner look with exultant eye upon the deep and serrie rank of his countryman "by saint james say he if ye fall this day ye fall by no mean hand for the flower of the knighthood of castile ride under the banner of don tello with the chivalry of asturias toledo leon cordova galicia and seville see the guidon of albornez cacorla rodriguez tavora with the two great order and the knight of france and of aragon if you will take my rede you will come to composition with they for they will give you such term as you have give i ""nay by saint paul it be pity if so many brave man be draw together and no little deed of arm to come of it ha william they advance upon we and by my soul it be sight that be worth come over the sea to see "as he speak the two wing of the spanish host consist of the knights of calatrava on the one side and of santiago upon the other came swoop swiftly down the valley while the main body follow more slowly behind five hundred pace from the english the two great body of horse cross each other and sweeping round in curve retire in feign confusion towards their centre often in bygone war have the moors tempt the hot blooded spaniards from their place of strength by such pretended flight but there be man upon the hill to whom every ruse and trick of war be as their daily trade and practice again and even near come the rally spaniards and again with cry of fear and stoop body they swerve off to right and leave but the english still stand stolid and observant among their rock the vanguard halt long bow shoot from the hill and with wave spear and vaunt shout challenge their enemy to come forth while two cavalier prick forward from the glitter rank walk their horse slowly between the two array with target brace and lance in rest like the challenger in tourney "by saint paul cry sir nigel with his one eye glow like an ember these appear to be two very worthy and debonair gentleman do not call to mind when have see any people who seem of so great heart and so high of enterprise we have our horse sir william shall we not relieve they of any vow which they may have upon their souls?"felton 's reply be to bind upon his charger and to urge it down the slope while sir nigel follow not three spears'-length behind he it be rugged course rocky and uneven yet the two knight choose their man dash onwards at the top of their speed while the gallant spaniards fly as swiftly to meet they the one to whom felton find himself oppose be tall stripling with stag 's head upon his shield while sir nigel 's man be broad and squat with plain steel harness and pink and white torse bind round his helmet the first strike felton on the target with such force as to split it from side to side but sir william 's lance crash through the camail which shield the spaniard 's throat and he fall scream hoarsely to the ground carry away by the heat and madness of fight the english knight never draw rein but charge straight on into the array of the knight of calatrava long time the silent rank upon the hill could see swirl and eddy deep down in the heart of the spanish column with circle of rear charger and flash blade here and there toss the white plume of the english helmet rise and fall like the foam upon wave with the fierce gleam and sparkle ever circle round it until at last it have sink from view and another brave man have turn from war to peace sir nigel meanwhile have find foeman worthy of his steel for his opponent be none other than sebastian gomez the pick lance of the monkish knights of santiago who have win fame in hundred bloody combat with the moors of andalusia so fierce be their meeting that their spear shiver up to the very grasp and the horse rear backwards until it seem that they must crash down upon their rider yet with consummate horsemanship they both swing round in long curvet and then pluck out their sword they lash at each other like two lusty smith hammer upon an anvil the charger spin round each other bite and striking while the two blade wheel and whiz and circle in gleam of dazzle light cut parry and thrust follow so swiftly upon each other that the eye could not follow they until at last come thigh to thigh they cast their arm around each other and roll off their saddle to the ground the heavy spaniard throw himself upon his enemy and pin he down beneath he raise his sword to slay he while shout of triumph rise from the rank of his countryman but the fatal blow never fall for even as his arm quiver before descend the spaniard give shudder and stiffen himself roll heavily over upon his side with the blood gush from his armpit and from the slit of his vizor sir nigel spring to his foot with his bloody dagger in his left hand and gaze down upon his adversary but that fatal and sudden stab in the vital spot which the spaniard have expose by raise his arm have prove instantly mortal the englishman leap upon his horse and make for the hill at the very instant that yell of rage from thousand voice and the clang of score of bugle announce the spanish onset but the islander be ready and eager for the encounter with foot firmly plant their sleeve roll back to give free play to their muscle their long yellow bow stave in their left hand and their quiver sling to the front they have wait in the four deep harrow formation which give strength to their array and yet permit every man to draw his arrow freely without harm to those in front aylward and johnston have be engage in throw light tuft of grass into the air to gauge the wind force and hoarse whisper pass down the rank from the file leader to the man with scrap of advice and admonition "do not shoot outside the fifteen score pace cry johnston we may need all our shaft ere we have do with they ""better to overshoot than to undershoot add aylward well to strike the rear guard than to feather shaft in the earth ""loose quick and sharp when they come add another let it be the eye to the string the string to the shaft and the shaft to the mark by our lady their banner advance and we must hold our ground now if ever we be to see southampton water again "alleyne stand with his sword draw amidst the archer see long toss and heave of the glitter squadron then the front rank begin to surge slowly forward to trot to canter to gallop and in an instant the whole vast array be hurtle onward line after line the air full of the thunder of their cry the ground shake with the beat of their hoofs the valley choke with the rush torrent of steel top by the wave plume the slant spear and the flutter banderole on they sweep over the level and up to the slope ere they meet the blind storm of the english arrow down go the whole rank in whirl of mad confusion horse plunge and kicking bewildered man fall rise stagger on or back while ever new line of horseman come spur through the gap and urge their charger up the fatal slope all around he alleyne could hear the stern short order of the master bowman while the air be fill with the keen twanging of the string and the swish and patter of the shaft right across the foot of the hill there have spring up long wall of struggle horse and stricken man which ever grow and heighten as fresh squadron pour on the attack one young knight on gray jennet leap over his fall comrade and gallop swiftly up the hill shriek loudly upon saint james ere he fall within spear length of the english line with the feather of arrow thrust out from every crevice and joint of his armor so for five long minute the gallant horseman of spain and of france strove ever and again to force passage until the wail note of bugle call they back and they ride slowly out of bow shot leave their good and their brave in the ghastly blood mottle heap behind they but there be little rest for the victor whilst the knight have charge they in front the slinger have creep round upon either flank and have gain footing upon the cliff and behind the outlying rock storm of stone break suddenly upon the defender who draw up in line upon the expose summit offer fair mark to their hidden foe johnston the old archer be strike upon the temple and fall dead without groan while fifteen of his bowman and six of the man at arm be strike down at the same moment the other lie on their face to avoid the deadly hail while at each side of the plateau fringe of bowman exchange shot with the slinger and crossbowman among the rock aim mainly at those who have swarm up the cliff and burst into laughter and cheer when well aim shaft bring one of their opponent topple down from his lofty perch "i think nigel say sir oliver stride across to the little knight that we should all acquit ourselves well have we our none meat for the sun be high in the heaven ""by saint paul quoth sir nigel pluck the patch from his eye think that be now clear of my vow for this spanish knight be person from whom much honor might be win indeed he be very worthy gentleman of good courage and great hardiness and it grieve i that he should have come by such hurt as to what you say of food oliver it be not to be think of for we have nothing with we upon the hill ""nigel cry sir simon burley hurry up with consternation upon his face aylward tell i that there be not ten score arrow leave in all their sheaf see they be spring from their horse and cut their solleret that they may rush upon we might we not even now make retreat?""my soul will retreat from my body first cry the little knight here be and here bide while god give i strength to lift sword ""and so say shout sir oliver throw his mace high into the air and catch it again by the handle "to your arm man roar sir nigel shoot while you may and then out sword and let we live or die together!"then up rise from the hill in the rugged cantabrian valley sound such as have not be hear in those part before nor be again until the stream which ripple amid the rock have be freeze by over four hundred winter and thaw by as many return spring deep and full and strong it thunder down the ravine the fierce battle call of warrior race the last stern welcome to whoso should join with they in that world old game where the stake be death thrice it swell forth and thrice it sink away echo and reverberate amidst the crag then with set face the company rise up among the storm of stone and look down upon the thousand who speed swiftly up the slope against they horse and spear have be set aside but on foot with sword and battle axe their broad shield sling in front of they the chivalry of spain rush to the attack and now arise struggle so fall so long so evenly sustain that even now the memory of it be hand down amongst the cantabrian mountaineer and the ill omen knoll be still point out by father to their child as the altura de los inglesos where the man from across the sea fight the great fight with the knight of the south the last arrow be quickly shoot nor could the slinger hurl their stone so close be friend and foe from side to side stretch the thin line of the english lightly armed and quick footed while against it storm and rage the press throng of fiery spaniards and of gallant bretons the clink of cross sword blade the dull thudding of heavy blow the panting and gasping of weary and wound man all rise together in wild long draw note which swell upwards to the ear of the wonder peasant who look down from the edge of the cliff upon the sway turmoil of the battle beneath they back and forward reel the leopard banner now bear up the slope by the rush and weight of the onslaught now push downward again as sir nigel burley and black simon with their veteran man at arm fling themselves madly into the fray alleyne at his lord 's right hand find himself sweep hither and thither in the desperate struggle exchange savage thrust one instant with spanish cavalier and the next tear away by the whirl of man and dash up against some new antagonist to the right sir oliver aylward hordle john and the bowman of the company fight furiously against the monkish knights of santiago who be lead up the hill by their prior great deep cheste man who wear brown monastic habit over his suit of mail three archer he slay in three giant stroke but sir oliver fling his arm round he and the two staggering and strain reel backwards and fall lock in each other 's grasp over the edge of the steep cliff which flank the hill in vain his knight storm and rave against the thin line which bar their path the sword of aylward and the great axe of john gleam in the forefront of the battle and huge jagged piece of rock hurl by the strong arm of the bowman crash and hurtle amid their rank slowly they give back down the hill the archer still hang upon their skirt with long litter of writhing and twisted figure to mark the course which they have take at the same instant the welshmen upon the left lead on by the scotch earl have charge out from among the rock which shelter they and by the fury of their outfall have drive the spaniards in front of they in headlong flight down the hill in the centre only thing seem to be go ill with the defender black simon be down die as he would wish to have die like grim old wolf in its lair with ring of his slain
