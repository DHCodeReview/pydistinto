dress of black silk with slash of gold at the neck and sleeve as the pair face the king there be sufficient resemblance between the three face to show that they be of one blood and to enable stranger to guess that the old be monsieur the young brother of the king while the other be louis the dauphin his only legitimate child and heir to throne to which in the strange working of providence neither he nor his son be destine to ascend strong as be the likeness between the three face each with the curve bourbon nose the large full eye and the thick hapsburg under lip their common heritage from anne of austria there be still vast difference of temperament and character stamp upon their feature the king be now in his six and fortieth year and the cropped black head be already thin little on the top and shade away to gray over the temple he still however retain much of the beauty of his youth temper by the dignity and sternness which increase with his year his dark eye be full of expression and his clear cut feature be the delight of the sculptor and the painter his firm and yet sensitive mouth and his thick well arched brow give an air of authority and power to his face while the more subdue expression which be habitual to his brother mark the man whose whole life have be spend in one long exercise of deference and self effacement the dauphin on the other hand with more regular face than his father have none of that quick play of feature when excited or that kingly serenity when compose which have make shrewd observer say that louis if he be not the great monarch that ever live be at least the well fit to act the part behind the king
