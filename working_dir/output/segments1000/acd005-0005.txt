""then would it not be well to be without him?"the guardsman shrug his epaulette in despair we shall both wind up in the bastille or vincennes at this rate say he you must know that it be in serve the country that he have make these enemy it be but five year since he make peace at nimeguen by which he tear away sixteen fortress from the spanish lowlands then also he have lay his hand upon strassburg and upon luxembourg and have chastise the genoans so that there be many who would fall upon he if they think that he be weak ""and why have he do all this?""because he be great king and for the glory of france "the stranger ponder over this answer for some time as they ride on between the high thin poplar which throw bar across the sunlit road "there be great man in schenectady once say he at last they be simple folk up yonder and they all have great trust in each other but after this man come among they they begin to miss one beaver skin and one bag of ginseng and one belt of wampum until at last old pete hendricks lose his chestnut three year old then there be search and fuss until they find all that have be lose in the stable of the new comer so we take he and some other and we hang he up on tree without ever think what great man he have be "de catinat shoot an angry glance at his companion your parable my friend be scarce polite say he if you and be to travel in peace you must keep close guard upon your tongue ""i would not give you offence and it may be that be wrong answer the american but speak as the matter seem to i and it be the right of free man to do that "de catinat 's frown relax as the other turn his earnest blue eye upon he by my soul where would the court be if every man do that say he but what in the name of heaven be amiss now?"his companion have hurl himself off his horse and be stoop low over the ground with his eye bend upon the dust then with quick noiseless step he zigzag along the road run swiftly across grassy bank and stand peer at the gap of fence with his nostril dilate his eye shine and his whole face aglow with eagerness "the fellow 's brain be go mutter de catinat as he catch at the bridle of the riderless horse the sight of paris have shake his wit what in the name of the devil ail you that you should stand glaring there?""a deer have pass whisper the other point down at the grass its trail lie along there and into the wood it could not have be long ago and there be no slur to the track so that it be not go fast have we but fetch my gun we might have follow it and bring the old man back side of venison ""for god 's sake get on your horse again cry de catinat distractedly "i fear that some evil will come upon you ere get you safe to the ruest martin again!""and what be wrong now ask amos green swinge himself into the saddle "why man these wood be the king 's preserve and you speak as coolly of slay his deer as though you be on the shore of michigan!""preserve they be tame deer an expression of deep disgust pass over his face and spur his horse he gallop onwards at such pace that de catinat after vainly endeavour to keep up have to shriek to he to stop "it be not usual in this country to ride so madly along the road he pant "it be very strange country cry the stranger in perplexity maybe it would be easy for i to remember what be allow it be but this morning that take my gun to shoot pigeon that be fly over the roof in yonder street and old pierre catch my arm with face as though it be the minister that be aim at and then there be that old man why they will not even let he say his prayer "de catinat laugh you will come to know our way soon say he this be crowded land and if all man ride and shoot as they list much harm would come from it but let we talk rather of your own country you have live much in the wood from what you tell i ""i be but ten when first journey with my uncle to sault la marie where the three great lake meet to trade with the chippewas and the tribe of the west ""i know not what la salle or de frontenac would have say to that the trade in those part belong to france ""we be take prisoner and so it be that come to see montreal and afterwards quebec in the end we be send back because they do not know what they could do with we ""it be good journey for first ""and ever since have be trade first on the kennebec with the abenaquis in the great forest of maine and with the micmac fish eater over the penobscot then later with the iroquois as far west as the country of the senecas at albany and schenectady we store our pelt and so on to new york where my father ship they over the sea ""but he could ill spare you surely?""very ill but as he be rich he think it well that should learn some thing that be not to be find in the wood and so he send i in thegolden rod under the care of ephraim savage ""who be also of new york?""nay he be the first man that ever be bear at boston ""i can not remember the name of all these village ""and yet there may come day when their name shall be as well know as that of paris "de catinat laugh heartily the wood may have give you much but not the gift of prophecy my friend well my heart be often over the water even as yours be and would ask nothing well than to see the palisade of point levi again even if all the five nations be rave upon the other side of they but now if you will look there in the gap of the tree you will see the king 's new palace "the two young man pull up their horse and look down at the wide spread building in all the beauty of its dazzle whiteness and at the lovely ground dot with fountain and with statue and bar with hedge and with walk stretch away to the dense wood which cluster round they it amuse de catinat to watch the swift play of wonder and admiration which flash over his companion 's feature "well what do you think of it he ask at last "i think that god 's good work be in america and man be in europe ""ay and in all europe there be no such palace as that even as there be no such king as he who dwell within it ""can see he think you?""who the king no no fear that you be scarce make for court ""nay should show he all honour ""how then what greeting would you give him?""i would shake he respectfully by the hand and ask as to his health and that of his family ""on my word think that such greeting might please he more than the bent knee and the rounded back and yet think my son of the wood that it be good not to lead you into path where you would be lose as would any of the courtier if you drop they in the gorge of the saguenay buthola what come here it look like one of the carriage of the court "a white cloud of dust which have roll towards they down the road be now so near that the glint of gilding and the red coat of the coachman could be see break out through it as the two cavalier rein their horse aside to leave the roadway clear the coach rumble heavily past they draw by two dapple gray and the horsemen catch glimpse as it pass of beautiful but haughty face which look out at they an instant afterwards sharp cry have cause the driver to pull up his horse and white hand beckon to they through the carriage window "it be madame de montespan the proud woman in france whisperedde catinat she would speak with we so do as do "he touch his horse with the spur give agambadewhich take he across to the carriage and then sweep off his hat he bow to his horse 's neck salute in which he be imitate though in somewhat ungainly fashion by his companion "ha captain say the lady with no very pleasant face we meet again ""fortune have ever be good to i madame ""it be not so this morning ""you say truly it give i hateful duty to perform ""and you perform it in hateful fashion ""nay madame what could do more?"the lady sneered and her beautiful face turn as bitter as it could upon occasion "you think that have no more power with the king you think that my day be past no doubt it seem to you that you might reap favour with the new by be the first to cast slight upon the old ""but madame you may spare your protestation be one who judge by deed and not by word do you then think that my charm have so fade that any beauty which ever have have be so withered?""nay madame be blind to think that ""blind as noontide owl say amos green with emphasis madame de montespan arch her eyebrow and glance at her singular admirer your friend at least speak that which he really feel say she at four o'clock to day we shall see whether other be of the same mind and if they be then it may be ill for those who mistook what be but pass shadow for last cloud she cast another vindictive glance at the young guardsman and rattle on once more upon her way "come on cry de catinat curtly for his companion be stare open mouthed after the carriage have you never see woman before?""never such one as that ""never one with so rail tongue dare swear say de catinat "never one with so lovely face and yet there be lovely face at therue st. martin also ""you seem to have nice taste in beauty for all your woodland training ""yes for have be cut away from woman so much that when stand before one feel that she be something tender and sweet and holy ""you may find dame at the court who be both tender and sweet but you will look long my friend before you find the holy one this one would ruin i if she can and only because have do what it be my duty to do to keep oneself in this court be like come down the la chine rapids where there be rock to right and rock to left and another perchance in front and if you so much as graze one where be you and your birch canoe but our rock be woman and in our canoe we bear all our worldly fortune now here be another who would sway i over to her side and indeed think it may prove to be the well side too "they have pass through the gateway of the palace and the broad sweeping drive lie in front of they dot with carriage and horseman on the gravel walk be many gaily dress lady who stroll among the flower bed or watch the fountain with the sunlight glint upon their high water spray one of these who have keep her eye turn upon the gate come hasten forward the instant that de catinat appear it be mademoiselle nanon theconfidanteof madame de maintenon "i be so pleased to see you captain she cry and have wait so patiently madame would speak with you the king come to she at three and we have but twenty minute hear that you have go to paris and so station myself here madame have something which she would ask you ""then will come at once ah de brissac it be well met!"a tall burly officer be pass in the same uniform which de catinat wear he turn at once and came smile towards his comrade "ah amory you have cover league or two from the dust on your coat!""we be fresh from paris but be call on business this be my friend monsieur amos green leave he in your hand for he be stranger from america and would fain see all that you can show he stay with i at my quarter and my horse too de brissac you can give it to the groom "throwe the bridle to his brother officer and press the hand of amos green de catinat spring from his horse and follow at the top of his speed in the direction which the young lady have already take the room which be inhabit by the lady who have already take so mark position at the court of france be as humble as be her fortune at the time when they be allot to she but with that rare tact and self restraint which be the lead feature in her remarkable character she have make no change in she live with the increase of her prosperity and forbore from provoke envy and jealousy by any display of wealth or of power in side wing of the palace far from the centralsalon and only to be reach by long corridor and stair be the two or three small chamber upon which the eye first of the court then of france and finally of the world be destine to be turn in such room have the destitute widow of the poet scarron be house when she have first be bring to court by madame de montespan as the governess of the royal child and in such room she still dwelt now that she have add to her maiden francoise d'aubigny the title of marquise de maintenon with the pension and estate which the king 's favour have award she here it be that every day the king would lounge find in the conversation of clever and virtuous woman charm and pleasure which none of the profess wit of his sparkle court have ever be able to give to he and here too the more sagacious of the courtier be begin to understand be the point formerly to be find in the magnificentsalonsof de montespan whence flow those impulse and tendency which be so eagerly study and so keenly follow up by all who wish to keep the favour of the king it be simple creed that of the court be the king pious then let all turn to their missal and their rosary be he rakish then who so rakish as his devoted follower but woe to the man who be rakish when he should be pray or who pull long face when the king wear laugh one and thus it be that keen eye be ever fix upon he and upon every influence that come near he so that the wary courtier watch the first subtle sign of come change might so order his conduct as to seem to lead rather than to follow the young guardsman have scarce ever exchange word with this powerful lady for it be her taste to isolate herself and to appear with the court only at the hour of devotion it be therefore with some feeling both of nervousness and of curiosity that he follow his guide down the gorgeous corridor where art and wealth have be strew with so lavish hand the lady pause in front of the chamber door and turn to her companion "madame wish to speak to you of what occur this morning say she should advise you to say nothing to madame about your creed for it be the only thing upon which her heart can be hard she raise her finger to emphasise the warning and tap at the door she push it open have bring captain de catinat madame say she "then let the captain step in the voice be firm and yet sweetly musical obey the command de catinat find himself in room which be no large and but little well furnished than that which be allot to his own use yet though simple everything in the chamber be scrupulously neat and clean betray the dainty taste of refined woman the stamp leather furniture the la savonniere carpet the picture of sacred subject exquisite from an artist 's point of view the plain but tasteful curtain all leave an impression half religious and half feminine but wholly soothing indeed the soft light the high white statue of the virgin in canopied niche with perfumed red lamp burn before it and the woodenprie dieuwith the red edge prayer book upon the top of it make the apartment look more like private chapel than fair lady 's boudoir on each side of the empty fireplace be little green cover arm chair the one for madame and the other reserve for the use of the king small three legged stool between they be heap with her work basket and her tapestry on the chair which be furth from the door with her back turn to the light madame be sit as the young officer enter it be her favourite position and yet there be few woman of her year who have so little reason to fear the sun for healthy life and active habit have leave she with clear skin and delicate bloom which any young beauty of the court might have envy her figure be graceful and queenly her gesture and pose full of natural dignity and her voice as he have already remark most sweet and melodious her face be handsome rather than beautiful set in statuesque classical mould with broad white forehead firm delicately sensitive mouth and pair of large serene gray eye earnest and placid in repose but capable of reflect the whole play of her soul from the merry gleam of humour to the quick flash of righteous anger an elevate serenity be however the lead expression of her feature and in that she present the strong contrast to her rival whose beautiful face be ever sweep by the emotion of the moment and who gleam one hour and shadow over the next like corn field in the wind in wit and quickness of tongue it be true that de montespan have the advantage but the strong common sense and the deep nature of the eld woman might prove in the end to be the well weapon de catinat at the moment without have time to notice detail be simply conscious that he be in the presence of very handsome woman and that her large pensive eye be fix critically upon he and seem to be read his thought as they have never be read before "i think that have already see you sir have not?""yes madame have once or twice have the honour of attend upon you though it may not have be my good fortune to address you ""my life be so quiet and retire that fear that much of what be good and worthy at the court be unknown to i it be the curse of such place that evil flaunt itself before the eye and can not be overlook while the good retire in its modesty so that at time we scarce dare hope that it be there you have serve monsieur?""yes madame in the lowlands on the rhine and in canada ""in canada ah what nobler ambition could woman have than to be member of that sweet sisterhood which be found by the holy marie de l'incarnation and the sainted jeanne le ber at montreal it be but the other day that have an account of they from father godet des marais what joy to be one of such body and to turn from the bless work of convert the heathen to the even more precious task of nursing back health and strength into those of god 's warrior who have be strike down in the fight with satan!"it be strange to de catinat who know well the sordid and dreadful existence lead by these same sister threaten ever with misery hunger and the scalping knife to hear this lady at whose foot lay all the good thing of this earth speak enviously of their lot "they be very good woman say he shortly remember mademoisellenanon 's warning and fear to trench upon the dangerous subject "and doubtless you have have the privilege also of see the holy bishoplaval?""yes madame have see bishop laval and trust that the sulpitians still hold their own against thejesuits?""i have hear madame that the jesuits be the strong at quebec and the other at montreal ""and who be your own director monsieur?"de catinat feel that the bad have come upon he have none madame ""ah it be too common to dispense with director and yet know not how could guide my step in the difficult path which tread if it be not for mine who be your confessor then?""i have none be of the reformed church madame "the lady give gesture of horror and sudden hardening show itself in mouth and eye what in the court itself she cry and in the neighbourhood of the king 's own person!"de catinat be lax enough in matter of faith and hold his creed rather as family tradition than from any strong conviction but it hurt his self esteem to see himself regard as though he have confess to something that be loathsome and unclean you will find madame say he sternly that member of my faith have not only stand around the throne of france but have even seat themselves upon it ""god have for his own all wise purpose permit it and none should know it well than whose grandsire theodore d'aubigny do so much to place crown upon the head of the great henry but henry 's eye be open ere his end come and pray oh from my heart pray that your may be also "she rise and throw herself down upon theprie dieusunk her face in her hand for some few minute during which the object of her devotion stand in some perplexity in the middle of the room hardly know whether such an attention should be regard as an insult or as favour tap at the door bring the lady back to this world again and her devoted attendant answer her summon to enter "the king be in the hall of victory madame say she he will be here in five minute ""very well stand outside and let i know when he come now sir she continue when they be alone once more you give note of mine to the king this morning?""i do madame ""and as understand madame de montespan be refuse admittance to thegrand lever she be madame ""but she wait for the king in the passage?""she do ""and wring from he promise that he would see she to day?""yes madame ""i would not have you tell i that which it may seem to you breach of your duty to tell but be fight now against terrible foe and for great stake do you understand me?"de catinat bow "then what do mean?""i presume that what madame mean be that she be fight for the king 's favour with the lady you mention ""as heaven be my judge have no thought of myself be fight with the devil for the king 's soul ""'tis the same thing madame "the lady smile if the king 's body be in peril could call on the aid of his faithful guard and not less so now surely when so much more be at stake tell i then at what hour be the king to meet the marquise in she room?""at four madame ""i thank you you have do i service and shall not forget it ""the king come madame say mademoiselle nanon again protrude her head "then you must go captain pass through the other room and so intothe outer passage and take this it be bossuet 's statement of thecatholic faith it have soften the heart of other and may yours now adieu!"de catinat pass out through another door and as he do so he glance back the lady have she back to he and her hand be raise to the mantel piece at
