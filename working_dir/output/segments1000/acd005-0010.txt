groom peer through the darkness after they with sardonic smile upon his face you wo n't draw rein wo n't you he mutter as he turn away well we shall see about that my captain we shall see about that "for mile or more the comrade gallop along neck to neck and knee to knee wind have spring up from the westward and the heavens be cover with heavy gray cloud which drift swiftly across crescent moon peep fitfully from time to time between the rift even during these moment of brightness the road shadow as it be by heavy tree be very dark but when the light be shut off it be hard but for the loom upon either side to tell where it lie de catinat at least find it so and he peer anxiously over his horse 's ear and stoop his face to the mane in his effort to see his way "what do you make of the road he ask at last "it look as if good many carriage wheel have pass over it to day ""what!mon dieu!do you mean to say that you can see carriage wheel there?""certainly why not?""why man can not see the road at all "amos green laugh heartily when you have travel in the wood by night as often as have say he when to show light may mean to lose your hair one come to learn to use one 's eye ""then you have good ride on and shall keep just behind you so!hola!what be the matter now?"there have be the sudden sharp snap of something break and theamerican have reel for an instant in the saddle "it 's one of my stirrup leather it have fall ""can you find it?""yes but can ride as well without it let we push on ""very good can just see you now "they have gallop for about five minute in this fashion de catinat 's horse 's head within few foot of the other 's tail when there be second snap and the guardsman roll out of the saddle on to the ground he keep his grip of the rein however and be up in an instant at his horse 's head sputter out oath as only an angry frenchman can "a thousand thunder of heaven he cry what be it that happen then?""your leather have go too ""two stirrup leather in five minute it be not possible ""it be not possible that it should be chance say the american gravely swinge himself off his horse why what be this my other leather be cut and hang only by thread ""and so do mine can feel it when pass my hand along have you tinder box let we strike light ""no no the man who be in the dark be in safety let the other folk strike light we can see all that be needful to we ""my rein be cut also ""and so be mine ""and the girth of my saddle ""it be wonder that we come so far with whole bone now who have play we this little trick?""who could it be but that rogue jacques he have have the horse in his charge by my faith he shall know what the strappado mean when see versailles again ""but why should he do it?""ah he have be set on to it he have be tool in the hand of those who wish to hinder our journey ""very like but they must have have some reason behind they know well that to cut our strap would not prevent we from reach paris since we could ride bareback or for that matter could run it if need be ""they hope to break our neck ""one neck they might break but scarce those of two since the fate of the one would warn the other ""well then what do you think that they mean cry de catinat impatiently for heaven 's sake let we come to some conclusion for every minute be of importance "but the other be not to be hurry out of his cool methodical fashion of speech and of thought "they could not have think to stop we say he "what do they mean then they could only have mean to delay we and why should they wish to delay we what could it matter to they ifwe give our message an hour or two soon or an hour or two later?it could not matter ""for heaven 's sake break in de catinat impetuously but amos green go on hammer the matter slowly out "why should they wish to delay we then there be only one reason that can see in order to give other folk time to get in front of we and stop we that be it captain 'd lay you beaver skin to rabbit pelt that be on the track there be be party of dozen horseman along this ground since the dew begin to fall if they be delay they would have time to form their plan before we come ""by my faith you may be right say de catinat thoughtfully what would you propose?""that we ride back and go by some less direct way ""it be impossible we should have to ride back to meudon cross road and then it would add ten mile to our journey ""it be well to get there an hour later than not to get there at all ""pshaw we be surely not to be turn from our path by mere guess there be the st. germain cross road about mile below when we reach it we can strike to the right along the south side of the river and so change our course ""but we may not reach it ""if anyone bar our way we shall know how to treat with they ""you would fight then?""yes ""what with dozen of them?""a hundred if we be on the king 's errand "amos green shrug his shoulder "you be surely not afraid?""yes be mighty afraid fight 's good enough when there be no help for it but call it fool 's plan to ride straight into trap when you might go round it ""you may do what you like say de catinat angrily "my father be gentleman the owner of thousand arpent of land and his son be not go to flinch in the king 's service ""my father answer amos green be merchant the owner of thousand skunk skin and his son know fool when he see one ""you be insolent sir cry the guardsman we can settle this matter at some more fitting opportunity at present continue my mission and you be very welcome to turn back to versailles if you be so inclined he raise his hat with punctilious politeness spring on to his horse and ride on down the road amos green hesitate little and then mount he soon overtake his companion the latter however be still in no very sweet temper and ride with rigid neck without glance or word for his comrade suddenly his eye catch something in the gloom which bring smile back to his face away in front of they between two dark tree clump lie vast number of shimmering glitter yellow point as thick as flower in garden they be the light of paris "see he cry point there be the city and close here must be the st. germain road we shall take it so as to avoid any danger ""very good but you should not ride too fast when your girth may break at any moment ""nay come on we be close to our journey 's end the st. germain road open just round this corner and then we shall see our way for the light will guide we "he cut his horse with his whip and they gallop together round the curve next instant they be both down in one wild heap of toss head and struggle hoofs de catinat partly cover by his horse and his comrade hurl twenty pace where he lie silent and motionless in the centre of the road monsieur de vivonne have lay his ambuscade with discretion with closed carriage and band of choose ruffian he have leave the palace good half hour before the king 's messenger and by the aid of his sister 's gold he have manage that their journey should not be very rapid one on reach the branch road he have order the coachman to drive some little distance along it and have tether all the horse to fence under his charge he have

wayside sapling and on receive the signal the other end be tie to gate post upon the further side the two cavalier could not possibly see it come as it do at the very curve of the road and as consequence their horse fall heavily to the ground and bring they down with they in an instant the dozen ruffian who have lurk in the shadow of the tree spring out upon they sword in hand but there be no movement from either of their victim de catinat lie breathe heavily one leg under his horse 's neck and the blood trickle in thin stream down his pale face and fall drop by drop on to his silver shoulder strap amos green be unwounded but his injure girth have give way in the fall and he have be hurl from his horse on to the hard road with violence which have drive every particle of breath from his body monsieur de vivonne light lantern and flash it upon the face of the two unconscious man this be bad business major despard say he to the man next he believe that they be both go ""tut
