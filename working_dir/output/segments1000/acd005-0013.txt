characteristic if he have say that he would be marry by the archbishop then the archbishop it must be to night at least there should be no marriage to morrow be new day and if it do not shake the king 's plan then indeed she must have lose her wit as well as her beauty she dress herself with care in the morning put on her powder her little touch of rouge her one patch near the dimple of her cheek

of her soul that to day at least his spirit be strong than her own "you be angry with i again she cry he have come with every intention of begin the interview by tell she bluntly of his marriage but now as he look upon her beauty and her love he feel that it would have be less brutal to strike she down at his foot let some one else tell she then she would know soon enough besides there would be less chance then of scene which be thing abhorrent to his soul his task be in any case quite difficult enough all this run swiftly through his mind and she as swiftly read it off in the brown eye which gaze at she "you have something you come to say and now you have not the heart to say it god bless the kindly heart which check the cruel tongue ""no no madame say louis would not be cruel can not forget that my life have be brighten and my court make brilliant during all these year by your wit and your beauty but time change madame and owe duty to the world which override my own personal inclination for every reason think that it be good that we should arrange in the way
