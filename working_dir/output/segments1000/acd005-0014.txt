gather together and put back into the open cupboard all the jewel which be scatter about the carpet having lock it and place the key on the table where its owner 's eye would readily fall upon it she strike gong which summon the little black page "your mistress be indispose say she go and bring her maid to she and so having do all that lie with she to do she turn away from the great silent room where amid the velvet and the gilding her beautiful rival lie like crush flower helpless and hopeless helpless enough for what could she do and hopeless too for how could fortune aid she the instant that her sense have come back to she she have send away her wait woman and lie with clasped hand and draw face plan out her own weary future she must go that be certain not merely because it be the king 's order but because only misery and mockery remain for she now in the palace where she have reign supreme it be true that she have hold her position against the queen before but all her hatred could not blind she to the fact that her rival be very different woman to poor meek little maria theresa no her spirit be break at last she must accept defeat and she must go she rise from the couch feel that she have age ten year in an hour there be much to be do and little time in which to do it she have cast down her jewel when the king have speak as though they would atone for the loss of his love but now that the love be go there be no reason why the jewel should be lose too if she have cease to be the most powerful she might still be the rich woman in france there be her pension of course that would be munificent one for louis be always generous and then there be all the spoil which she have collect during these long year the jewel the pearl the gold the vase the picture the crucifix the watch the trinket together they represent many million of livre with her own hand she pack away the more precious and portable of they while she arrange with her brother for the safe keeping of the other all day she be at work in mood of feverish energy do anything and everything which might distract her thought from her own defeat and her rival 's victory by evening all be ready and she have arrange that her property should be send after she to petit bourg to which castle she intend to retire it want half an hour of the time fix for her departure when young cavalier whose face be strange to she be usher into the room he come with message from her brother "monsieur de vivonne regret madame that the rumour of your departure have get abroad among the court ""what do care for that monsieur she retort with all her old spirit "he say madame that the courtier may assemble at the west gate to see you go that madame de neuilly will be there and the duchesse de chambord and mademoiselle de rohan and the lady shrink with horror at the thought of such an ordeal to drive away from the palace where she have be more than queen under the scornful eye and bitter gibe of so many personal enemy after all the humiliation of the day that would be the crown cup of sorrow her nerve be break she could not face it "tell my brother monsieur that should be much oblige if he would make fresh arrangement by which my departure might be private ""he bid i say that he have do so madame ""ah at what hour then?""now as soon as possible ""i be ready at the west gate then?""no at the east the carriage wait ""and where be my brother?""we be to pick he up at the park gate ""and why that?""because he be watch and be he see beside the carriage all would be know ""very good then monsieur if you will take my cloak and this casket we may start at once "they make their way by circuitous route through the less use corridor she hurry on like guilty creature hood draw over her face and her heart in flutter at every stray footfall but fortune stand her friend she meet no one and soon find herself at the eastern postern gate couple of phlegmatic swiss guardsman lean upon their musket upon either side and the lamp above shine upon the carriage which await she the door be open and tall cavalier swathe in black cloak hand she into it he then take the seat opposite to she slam the door and the caleche rattle away down the main drive it have not surprise she that this man should join she inside the coach for it be usual to have guard there and he be doubtless take the place which her brother would afterwards occupy that be all natural enough but when ten minute pass by and he have neither move nor speak she peer at he through the gloom with some curiosity in the glance which she have of he as he hand she in she have see that he be dress like gentleman and there be that in his bow and wave as he do it which tell her experienced sense that he be man of courtly manner but courtier as she have know they be gallant and garrulous and this man be so very quiet and still again she strain her eye through the gloom his hat be pull down and his cloak be still draw across his mouth but from out of the shadow she seem to get glimpse of two eye which peer at she even as she do at he at last the silence impress she with vague uneasiness it be time to bring it to an end "surely monsieur we have pass the park gate where we be to pick up my brother "her companion neither answer nor move she think that perhaps the rumble of the heavy caleche have drown her voice "i say monsieur she repeat lean forwards that we have pass the place where we be to meet monsieur de vivonne "he take no notice "monsieur she cry again remark that we have pass the gate "there be no answer thrill run through her nerve who or what could he be this silent man then suddenly it strike she that he might be dumb "perhap monsieur be afflict she say perhaps monsieur can not speak if that be the cause of your silence will you raise your hand and shall understand he sit rigid and silent then sudden mad fear come upon she shut up in the dark with this dreadful voiceless thing she scream in her terror and strove to pull down the window and open the door but grip of steel close suddenly round her wrist and force she back into her seat and yet the man 's body have not move and there be no sound save the lurch and rasp of the carriage and the clatter of the fly horse they be already out on the country road far beyond versailles it be dark than before heavy cloud have bank over the heavens and the rumbling of thunder be hear low down on the horizon the lady lie back pant upon the leather cushion of the carriage she be brave woman and yet this sudden strange horror come upon she at the moment when she be weak have shake she to the soul she crouch in the corner stare across with eye which be dilate with terror at the figure on the other side if he would but say something any revelation any menace be well than this silence it be so dark now that she could hardly see his vague outline and every instant as the storm gather it become still dark the wind be blow in little short angry puff and still there be that far off rattle and rumble again the strain of the silence be unbearable she must break it at any cost "sir say she there be some mistake here do not know by what right you prevent i from pull down the window and give my direction to the coachman "he say nothing "i repeat sir that there be some mistake this be the carriage of my brother monsieur de vivonne and he be not man who will allow his
