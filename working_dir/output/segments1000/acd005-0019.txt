have swear by the eternal listen to that the clear call of military bugle ring out in the morning air with cry of amazement they all three crane forward and peer over the edge large ship be lie under the very shadow of the iceberg they look straight down upon her snow white deck fringe with shine brass cannon and dot with seaman little clump of soldier stand upon the poop go through the manual exercise and it be from they that the call have come which have sound so unexpectedly in the ear of the castaway stand back from the edge they have not only look over the top mast of this welcome neighbour but they have themselves be invisible from her deck now the discovery be mutual as be show by chorus of shout and cry from beneath they but the three do not wait an instant slide and scramble down the wet slippery incline they rush shout through the crack and into the cave where their comrade have just be startle by the bugle call while in the middle of their cheerless breakfast few hurried word and the leaky long boat have be launch their possession have be bundle in and they be afloat once more pull round promontory of the berg they find themselves under the stern of fine corvette the side of which be line with friendly face while from the peak there droop huge white banner mottle over with the golden lily of france in very few minute their boat have be haul up and they find themselves on board thest christopheman of war convey marquis de denonville the new governor general of canada to take over his duty singular colony it be of which the shipwreck party find themselves now to be member thest christophehad leave rochelle three week before with four small consort convey five hundred soldier to help the struggle colony on the st. lawrence the squadron have

puritan of boston and three huguenot to such gathering be indeed to bring fire brand and powder barrel together and yet all aboard be so busy with their own concern that the castaway be leave very much to themselves thirty of the soldier be down with fever and scurvy and both priest and nun be fully take up in nurse they denonville the governor pious minded dragoon walk the deck all day read the psalms of david and sit up half the night with map and chart lay out before he plan out the destruction of the iroquois who be ravage his dominion the gallant and the lady flirt the maiden of anjou make eye at the soldier of quercy and the bishop saint vallier read his office and lecture his clergy ephraim savage use to stand all day glare at the good man as he pace the deck with his red edge missal in his hand and mutter about the abomination of desolation but his little way be put down to his exposure upon the iceberg and to the fix idea in the french mind that man of the anglo saxon stock be not to be hold accountable for their action there be peace between england and france at present though feeling run high between canada and new york the french believing and with some justice that the english colonist be whoop on the demon who attack they ephraim and his man be therefore receive hospitably on board though the ship be so crowded that they have to sleep wherever they could find cover and space for their body the catinats too have be treat in an even more kindly fashion the weak old man and the beauty of his daughter arouse the interest of the governor himself de catinat have during the voyage exchange his uniform for plain sombre suit so that except for his military bearing there be nothing to show that he be fugitive from the army old catinat be now so weak that he be past the answering of question his daughter be forever at his side and the soldier be diplomatist enough after training at versailles to say much without say anything and so their secret be still preserve de catinat have know what it be to be huguenot in canada before the law be alter he have no wish to try it after on the day after the rescue they sight cape breton in the south and soon run swiftly before an easterly wind see the loom of the east end of anticosti then they sail up the mighty river though from mid channel the bank upon either side be hardly to be see as the shore narrow in they see the wild gorge of the saguenay river upon the right with the smoke from the little fishing and trading station of tadousac stream up above the pine tree naked indians with their face daub with red clay algonquins and abenakis cluster round the ship in their birchen canoe with fruit and vegetable from the land which bring fresh life to the scurvy stricken soldier thence the ship tack on up the river past mal bay the ravine of the eboulements and the bay of st. paul with its broad valley and woode mountain all in blaze with their beautiful autumn dress their scarlet their purple and their gold from the maple the ash the young oak and the sapling of the birch amos green lean on the bulwark stare with long eye at these vast expanse of virgin woodland hardly traversed save by an occasional wandering savage or hardycoureur de bois then the bold outline of cape tourmente loom up in front of they they pass the rich placid meadow of laval 's seigneury of beaupre and skirt the settlement of the island of orleans they see the broad pool stretch out in front of they the fall of montmorenci the high palisade of cape levi the cluster of vessel and upon the right that wonderful rock with its diadem of tower and its township huddle round its base the centre and stronghold of french power in america cannon thunder from the bastion above and be echo back by the warship while ensign dip hat wave and swarm of boat and canoe shoot out to welcome the new governor and to convey the soldier and passenger to shore the old merchant have pine away since he have leave french soil like plant which have be pluck from its root the shock of the shipwreck and the night spend in their bleak refuge upon the iceberg have be too much for his year and strength since they have be pick up he have lain amid the scurvy stricken soldier with hardly sign of life save for his thin breathing and the twitching of his scraggy throat now however at the sound of the cannon and the shouting he open his eye and raise himself slowly and painfully upon his pillow what be it father what can we do for you cry adele we be in america and here be amory and here be your child "but the old man shake his head the lord have bring i to the promise land but he have not will that should enter into it say he may his will be do and bless be his name forever but at least should wish like moses to gaze upon it if can not set foot upon it think you amory that you could lend i your arm and lead i on to the deck?""if have another to help i say de catinat and ascend to the deck he bring amos green back with he now father if you will lay hand upon the shoulder of each you need scarce put your foot to the board "a minute later the old merchant be on the deck and the two young man have seat he upon coil of rope with his back against the mast where he should be away from the crush the soldier be already crowd down into the boat and all be so busy over their own affair that they pay no heed to the little group of refugee who gather round the stricken man he turn his head painfully from side to side but his eye brighten as they fall upon the broad blue stretch of water the flash of the distant fall the high castle and the long line of purple mountain away to the north west "it be not like france say he it be not green and peaceful and smile but it be grand and strong and stern like he who make it as have weaken adele my soul have be less clogged by my body and have see clearly much that have be dim to i and it have seem to i my child that all this country of america not canada alone but the land where you be bear also amos green and all that stretch away towards yonder set sun will be the good gift of god to man for this have he hold it conceal through all the age that now his own high purpose may be work upon it for here be land which be innocent which have no past guilt to atone for no feud nor ill custom nor evil of any kind and as the year roll on all the weary and homeless one all who be stricken and landless and wrong will turn their face to it even as we have do and hence will come nation which will surely take all that be good and leave all that be bad moulding and fashion itself into the high do not see such mighty people people who will care more to raise their low than to exalt their rich who will understand that there be more bravery in peace than in war who will see that all man be brother and whose heart will not narrow themselves down to their own frontier but will warm in sympathy with every noble cause the whole world through that be what see adele as lie here beside shore upon which shall never set my foot and say to you that if you and amory go to the building of such nation then indeed your life be not misspent it will come and when it come may god guard it may god watch over it and direct it his head have sink gradually low upon his breast and his lid have fall slowly over his eye which have be look away out past point levi at the rolling wood and the far off mountain adele give quick cry of despair and throw her arm round the old man 's neck "he be die amory he be die she cry stern franciscan friar who have be tell his bead within few pace of they hear the cry and be beside they in an instant "he be indeed die he say as he gaze down at the ashen face "has the old man have the sacrament of the church?""i do not think that he need they answer de catinat evasively "which of we do not need they young man say the friar sternly and how can man hope for salvation without they shall myself administer they without delay "but the old huguenot have open his eye and with last flicker of strength he push away the gray hooded figure which bend over he "i leave all that love rather than yield to you he cry and think you that you can overcome i now?"the franciscan start back at the word and his hard suspicious eye shoot from de catinat to the weep girl "so say he you be huguenot then!""hush do not wrangle before man who be die cry de catinat in voice as fierce as his own "before man who be dead say amos green solemnly as he speak the old man 's face have relax his thousand wrinkle have be smooth suddenly out as though an invisible hand have pass over they and his head fall back against the mast adele remain motionless with her arm still clasp round his neck and her cheek press against his shoulder she have faint de catinat raise his wife and bear she down to the cabin of one of the lady who have already show they some kindness death be no new thing aboard the ship for they have lose ten soldier upon the outward passage so that amid the joy and bustle of the disembarking there be few who have thought to spare upon the dead pilgrim and the less so when it be whisper abroad that he have be huguenot brief order be give that he should be bury in the river that very night and then save for sailmaker who fasten the canvas round he mankind have do its last for theophile catinat with the survivor however it be different and when the troop be all disembark they be muster in little group upon the deck and an officer of the governor 's suite decide upon what should be do with they he be portly good humoured ruddy cheek man but de catinat see with apprehension that the friar walk by his side as he advance along the deck and exchange few whispered remark with he there be bitter smile upon the monk 's dark face which bode little good for the heretic "it shall be see to good father it shall be see to say the officer impatiently in answer to one of these whispered injunction be as zealous servant of holy church as you be ""i trust that you be monsieur de bonneville with so devout governor as monsieur de denonville it might be an ill thing even in this world for the officer of his household to be lax "the soldier glance angrily at his companion for he see the threat which lurk under the word "i would have you remember father say he that if faith be virtue charity be no less so then speak in english which be captain savage?""ephraim savage of boston ""and master amos green?""amos green of new york ""and master tomlinson?""john tomlinson of salem ""and master mariner hiram jefferson joseph cooper seek grace spalding and paul cushing all of massachusetts bay?""we be all here ""it be the governor 's order that all whom have name shall be convey at once to the trading brighope which be yonder ship with the white paint line she sail within the hour for the english province "a buzz of joy break from the castaway mariner at the prospect of be so speedily restore to their home and they hurry away to gather together the few possession which they have save from the wreck the officer put his list in his pocket and step across to where de catinat lean moodily against the bulwark "surely you remember i he say could not forget your face even though you have exchange blue coat for black one "de catinat grasp the hand which be hold out to he "i remember you well de bonneville and the journey that we make together to fort frontenac but it be not for i to claim your friendship now that thing have go amiss with i ""tut man once my friend always my friend ""i fear too that my acquaintance would do you little good with yonder dark cowl friar who be glower behind you ""well well you know how it be with we here frontenac could keep they in their place but de la barre be as clay in their hand and this new one promise to follow in his step what with the sulpitians at montreal and the jesuits here we poor devil be between the upper and the nether stone but be grieve from my heart to give such welcome as this to an old comrade and still more to his wife ""what be to be do then?""you be to be confine to the ship until she sail which will be in week at the furth ""and then?""you be to be carry home in she and hand over to the governor of rochelle to be send back to paris those be monsieur de denonville 's order and if they be not carry out to the letter then we shall have the whole hornet 's nest about our ear "de catinat groan as he listen after all their striving and trial and effort to return to paris the scorn of his enemy and an object of pity to his friend be too deep humiliation he flush with shame at the very thought to be lead back like the home sick peasant who have desert from his regiment well one spring into the broad blue river beneath he be it not for little pale faced adele who have none but he to look to it be so tame so ignominious and yet in this float prison with woman whose fate be link with his own what hope be there of escape?de bonneville have leave he with few blunt word of sympathy but the friar still pace the deck with furtive glance at he from time to time and two soldier who be station upon the poop pass and repasse within few yard of he they have order evidently to mark his movement heart sick he lean over the side watch the indians in their paint and feather shoot backwards and forwards in their canoe and stare across at the town where the gaunt gable end of house and char wall mark the effect of the terrible fire which few year before have completely destroy the low part as he stand gaze his attention be draw away by the swish of oar and large boat full of man pass immediately underneath where he stand it hold the new englanders who be be convey to the ship which be to take they home there be the four seaman huddle together and there in the sheet be captain ephraim savage and amos green converse together and point to the shipping the grizzle face of the old puritan and the bold feature of the woodsman be turn more than once in his direction but no word of farewell and no kindly wave of the hand come back to the lonely exile they be so full of their own future and their own happiness that they have not thought to spare upon his misery he could have bear anything from his enemy but this sudden neglect from his friend come too heavily after his other trouble he stoop his face to his arm and burst in an instant into passion of sob before he raise his eye again the brig have hoist her anchor and be tack under full canvas out of the quebec basin that night old theophile catinat be bury from the ship 's side his sole mourner the two who bear his own blood in their vein the next day de catinat spend upon deck amid the bustle and confusion of the unlading endeavour to cheer adele by light chatter which come from heavy heart he point out to she the place which he have know so well the citadel where he have be quarter the college of the jesuits the cathedral of bishop laval the magazine of the old company dismantle by the great fire and the house of aubert de la chesnaye the only private one which have remained stand in the low part from where they lay they could see not only the place of interest but something also of that motley population which make the town so different to all other save only its young sister montreal pass and repasse along the steep path with the picket fence which connect the two quarter they see the whole panorama of canadian life move before their eye the soldier with their slouch hat their plume and their bandoleer habitant from the rivercotesin their rude peasant dress little change from their forefather of brittany or normandy and young ruffler from france or from the seigneury who cock their hat and swagger in what they think to be the true versailles fashion there too might be see little knot of the man of the wood coureur de boisorvoyageur with leathern hunt tunic fringe legging and fur cap with eagle feather who come back once year to the city leave their indian wife and child in some up country wigwam redskin too be there leather face algonquin fisher and hunter wild micmacs from the east and savage abenakis from the south while everywhere be the dark habit of the franciscans and the black cassock and broad hat of the recollets and jesuit the move spirit of the whole such be the folk who crowd the street of the capital of this strange offshoot of france which have be plant along the line of the great river thousand league from the parent country and it be singular settlement the most singular perhaps that have ever be make for long twelve hundred mile it extend from tadousac in the east away to the trading station upon the border of the great lake limit itself for the most part to narrow cultivate strip upon the margin of the river bank in behind by wild forest and unexplored mountain which forever tempt the peasant from his hoe and his plough to the free life of the paddle and the musket thin scattered clearing alternate with little palisaded clump of log hew house mark the line where civilisation be force itself in upon the huge continent and barely hold its own against the rigour of northern climate and the ferocity of merciless enemy the whole white population of this mighty district include soldier priest and woodman with all woman and child be very far short of twenty thousand soul and yet so great be their energy and such the advantage of the central government under which they live that they have leave their trace upon the whole continent when the prosperous english settler be content to live upon their acre and when no axe have ring upon the further side of the alleghanies the french have push their daring pioneer some in the black robe of the missionary and some in the fringed tunic of the hunter to the uttermost end of the continent they have map out the lake and have barter with the fierce sioux on the great plain where the wooden wigwam give place to the hide tee pee marquette have follow the illinois down to the mississippi and have trace the course of the great river until first of all white man he look upon the turbid flood of the rush missouri la salle have venture even far and have pass the ohio and have make his way to the mexican gulf raise the french arm where the city of new orleans be afterwards to stand other have push on to the rocky mountains and to the huge wilderness of the north west preach bartering cheating baptise sway by many motive and hold only in common courage which never falter and fertility of resource which take they in safety past every danger frenchman be to the north of the british settlement frenchmen be to the west of they and frenchmen be to the south of they and if all the continent be not now french the fault assuredly do not rest with that iron race of early canadians all this de catinat explain to adele during the autumn day try to draw her thought away from the trouble of the past and from the long dreary voyage which lie before she she fresh from the staid life of the parisian street and from the tame scenery of the seine gaze with amazement at the river the wood and the mountain and clutch her husband 's arm in horror when canoeful of wild skin clothe algonquins their face stripe with white and red paint came fly past with the foam dashing from their paddle again the river turn from blue to pink again the old citadel be bathe in the evening glow and again the two exile descend to their cabin with cheer word for each other and heavy thought in their own heart de catinat 's bunk be next to port hole and it be his custom to keep this open as the caboose be close to he in which the cooking be do for the crew and the air be hot and heavy that night he find it impossible to sleep and he lie toss under his blanket
