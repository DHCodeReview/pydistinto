man have change it into hell and that nameless horror lurk behind all the beauty of the fade leave and of the woodland flower often as he lie at night beside the smoulder fire upon his couch of spruce and look at the little figure muffle in the blanket and slumber peacefully by his side he feel that he have no right to expose she to such peril and that in the morning they should turn the canoe eastward again and take what fate might bring they at quebec but ever with the daybreak there come the thought of the humiliation the dreary homeward voyage the separation which would await they in galley and dungeon to turn he from his purpose on the seventh day they rest at point but few mile from the mouth of the richelieu river where large blockhouse fort richelieu have be build by m. de saurel once past this they have no great distance to go to reach the seigneury of de catinat 's friend of thenoblessewho would help they upon their way they have spend the night upon little island in midstream and at early dawn they be about to thrust the canoe out again from the sand line cove in which she lie when ephraim savage growl in his throat and point out across the water large canoe be come up the river fly along as quick as dozen arm could drive it in the stern sit dark figure which bend forward with every swing of the paddle as though consume by eagerness to push onwards even at that distance there be no mistaking it it be the fanatical monk whom they have leave behind they conceal among the brushwood they watch their pursuer fly past and vanish round curve in the stream then they look at one another in perplexity "we'd have do well either to put he overboard or to take he as ballast say ephraim he be hull down in front of we now and draw full ""well we ca n't take the back track anyhow remark amos "and yet how can we go on say de catinat despondently this vindictive devil will give word at the fort and at every other point along the river he have be back to quebec it be one of the governor 's own canoe and go three pace to our two ""let i cipher it out amos green sit on fallen maple with his head sink upon his hand well say he presently if it be no good go on and no good go back there be only one way and that be to go to one side that be so ephraim be it not?""ay ay lad if you ca n't run you must tack but it seem shoal water on either bow ""we ca n't go to the north so it follow that we must go to the south ""leave the canoe?""it be our only chance we can cut through the wood and come out near this friendly house on the richelieu the friar will lose our trail then and we 'll have no more trouble with he if he stay on the st. lawrence ""there be nothing else for it say captain ephraim ruefully it be not my way to go by land if can get by water and have not be fathom deep in wood since king philip come down on the province so you must lay the course and keep she straight amos ""it be not far and it will not take we long let we get over to the southern bank and we shall make start if madame tire de catinat we shall take turn to carry she ""ah monsieur you can not think what good walker be in this splendid air one might go on forever ""we will cross then "in very few minute they be at the other side and have land at the edge of the forest there the gun and ammunition be allot to each man and his share of the provision and of the scanty baggage then having pay the indians and having instruct they to say nothing of their movement they turn their back upon the river and plunge into the silent wood all day they push on through the woodland walk in single file amos green first then the seaman then the lady and de catinat bring up the rear the young woodsman advance cautiously see and hear much that be lose to his companion stop continually and examine the sign of leaf and moss and twig their route lie for the most part through open glade amid huge pine forest with green sward beneath their foot make beautiful by the white euphorbia the golden rod and the purple aster sometimes however the great trunk close in upon they and they have to grope their way in dim twilight or push path through the tangled brushwood of green sassafra or scarlet sumach and then again the wood would shred suddenly away in front of they and they would skirt marsh overgrown with wild rice and dot with little dark clump of alder bush or make their way past silent woodland lake all streaked and bar with the tree shadow which throw their crimson and claret and bronze upon the fringe of the deep blue sheet of water there be stream too some clear and ripple where the trout flash and the king fisher gleam other dark and poisonous from the tamarack swamp where the wanderer have to wade over their knee and carry adele in their arm so all day they journey mid the great forest with never hint or token of their fellow man but if man be absent there be at least no want of life it buzz and chirp and chatter all round they from marsh and stream and brushwood sometimes it be the dun coat of deer which glance between the distant trunk sometimes the badger which scuttle for its hole at their approach once the long in toed track of bear lie mark in the soft earth before they and once amos pick great horn from amid the bush which some moose have shed the month before little red squirrel dance and clatter above their head and every oak be choir with hundred tiny voice pipe from the shadow of its foliage as they pass the lake the heavy gray stork flap up in front of they and they see the wild duck whir off in long against the blue sky or hear the quaver cry of the loon from amid the reed that night they sleep in the wood amos green light dry wood fire in thick copse where at dozen pace it be invisible few drop of rain have fall so with the quick skill of the practise woodsman he make two little shed of elm and basswood bark one to shelter the two refugee and the other for ephraim and himself he have shoot wild goose and this with the remain of their biscuit serve they both for supper and for breakfast next day at noon they pass little clearing in the centre of which be the char ember of fire amos spend half an hour in read all that stick and ground could tell he then as they resume their way he explain to his companion that the fire have be light three week before that white man and two indians have camp there that they have be journey from west to east and that one of the indians have be squaw no other trace of their fellow mortal do they come across until late in the afternoon amos halt suddenly in the heart of thick grove and raise his hand to his ear "listen he cry "i hear nothing say ephraim "nor add de catinat "ah but do cry adele gleefully it be bell and at the very time of day when the bell all sound in paris!""you be right madame it be what they call the angelus bell ""ah yes hear it now cry de catinat it be drown by the chirping of the bird but whence come bell in the heart of canadian forest?""we be near the settlement on the richelieu it must be the bell of the chapel at the fort ""fort st. louis ah then we be no great way from my friend 's seigneury ""then we may sleep there to night if you think that he be indeed to be trust ""yes he be strange man with way of his own but would trust he with my life ""very good we shall keep to the south of the fort and make for his house but something be put up the bird over yonder ah hear the sound of step crouch down here among the sumach until we see who it be who walk so boldly through the wood "they stoop all four among the brushwood peep out between the tree trunk at little glade towards which amos be look for long time the sound which the quick ear of the woodsman have detect be inaudible to the other but at last they too hear the sharp snapping of twig as some one force his passage through the undergrowth moment later man push his way into the open whose appearance be so strange and so ill suit to the spot that even amos gaze upon he with amazement he be very small man so dark and weather stain that he might have pass for an indian be it not that he walk and be clothe as no indian have ever be he wear broad brim hat fray at the edge and so discolour that it be hard to say what its original tint have be his dress be of skin rudely cut and dangle loosely from his body and he wear the high boot of dragoon as tattered and stain as the rest of his raiment on his back he bear huge bundle of canvas with two long stick project from it and under each arm he carry what appear to be large square painting "he be no injun whisper amos and he be no woodsman either bless if ever see the match of him!""he 's neithervoyageur nor soldier norcoureur de bois say decatinat "'pear to i to have jurymast rig upon his back and fore and main staysail set under each of his arm say captain ephraim "well he seem to have no consort so we may hail he without fear "they rise from their ambush and as they do so the stranger catch sight of they instead of show the uneasiness which any man might be expect to feel at suddenly find himself in the presence of stranger in such country he promptly alter his course and come towards they as he cross the glade however the sound of the distant bell fall upon his ear and he instantly whip off his hat and sink his head in prayer cry of horror rise not only from adele but from everyone of the party at the sight which meet their eye the top of the man 's head be go not vestige of hair or of white skin remain but in place of it be dreadful crinkle discolour surface with sharp red line run across his brow and round over his ear "by the eternal cry amos the man have lose his scalp!""my god say de catinat look at his hands!"he have raise they in prayer two or three little stump project upwards show where the finger have be "i've see some queer figure head in my life but never one like that say captain ephraim it be indeed most extraordinary face which confront they as they advance it be that of man who might have be of any age and of any nation for the feature be so distorted that nothing could be learn from they one eyelid be droop with puckering and flatness which show that the ball be go the other however shoot as bright and merry and kindly glance as ever come from choose favourite of fortune his face be fleck over with peculiar brown spot which have most hideous appearance and his nose have be burst and shatter by some terrific blow and yet in spite of this dreadful appearance there be something so noble in the carriage of the man in the pose of his head and in the expression which still hang like the scent from crush flower round his distorted feature that even the blunt puritan seaman be awe by it "good evening my child say the stranger pick up his picture again and advance towards they presume that you be from the fort though may be permit to observe that the wood be not very safe for lady at present ""we be go to the manor house of charles de la noue at sainte marie say de catinat and we hope soon to be in place of safety but grieve sir to see how terribly you have be mishandle ""ah you have observe my little injury then they know no well poor soul they be but mischievous child merry hearted but mischievous tut tut it be laughable indeed that man 's vile body should ever clog his spirit and yet here be full of the will to push forward and yet must even seat myself on this log and rest myself for the rogue have blow the calf of my leg off ""my god blown they off the devils!""ah but they be not to be blame no no it would be uncharitable to blame they they be ignorant poor folk and the prince of darkness be behind they to urge they on they sink little charge of powder into my leg and then they explode they which make i slow walker than ever though be never very brisk the snail be what be call at school in tours yes and afterwards at the seminary be always the snail '""who be you then sir and who be it who have use you so shamefully ask de catinat "oh be very humble person be ignatius morat of the society of jesus and as to the people who have use i little roughly why if you be send upon the iroquois mission of course you know what to expect have nothing at all to complain of why they have use i very much well than they do father jogues father breboeuf and good many other whom could mention there be time it be true when be quite hopeful of martyrdom especially when they think my tonsure be too small which be their merry way of put it but suppose be not worthy of it indeed know that be not so it only end in just little roughness ""where be you go then ask amos who have listen in amazement to the man 's word "i be go to quebec you see be such useless person that until have see the bishop can really do no good at all ""you mean that you will resign your mission into the bishop 's hand say de catinat "oh no that would be quite the sort of thing which should do if be leave to myself for it be incredible how cowardly be you would not think it possible that priest of god could be so frightened as be sometimes the mere sight of fire make i shrink all into myself ever since go through the ordeal of the light pine splinter which have leave all these ugly stain upon my face but then of course there be the order to be think of and member of the order do not leave their post for trifling cause but it be against the rule of holy church that maim man should perform the rite and so until have see the bishop and have his dispensation shall be even more useless than ever ""and what will you do then?""oh then of course will go back to my flock ""to the iroquois!""that be where be station ""amos say de catinat have spend my life among brave man but think that this be the brave man that have ever met!""on my word say amos have see some good man too but never one that think be well than this you be weary father have some of our cold goose and there be still drop of cognac in my flask ""tut tut my son if take anything but the very simple living it make i so lazy that become snail indeed ""but you have no gun and no food how do you live?""oh the good god have place plenty of food in these forest for traveller who dare not eat very much have have wild plum and wild grape and nut and cranberry and nice little dish oftripe de merefrom the rock "the woodsman make wry face at the mention of this delicacy "i have as soon eat pot of glue say he but what be this which you carry on your back?""it be my church ah have everything here tent altar surplice everything can not venture to celebrate service myself without the dispensation but surely this venerable man be himself in order and will solemnise the most bless function "amos with sly twinkle of the eye translate the proposal to ephraim who stand with his huge red hand clench mumble about the saltless pottage of papacy de catinat reply briefly however that they be all of the laity and that if they be to reach their destination before nightfall it be necessary that they should push on "you be right my son say the little jesuit these poor people have already leave their village and in few day the wood will be full of they though do not think that any have cross the richelieu yet there be one thing however which would have you do for i ""and what be that?""it be but to remember that have leave with father lamberville at onondaga the dictionary which have make of the iroquois and french language there also be my account of the copper mine of the great lakes which visit two year ago and also an orrery which have make to show the northern heaven with the star of each month as they be see from this meridian if aught be to go amiss with father lamberville or with i and we do not live very long on the iroquois mission it would be well that some one else should profit from my work ""i will tell my friend to night but what be these great picture father and why do you bear they through the wood he turn they over as he speak and the whole party gather round they stare in amazement they be very rough daub crudely coloured and gaudy in the first red man be repose serenely upon what appear to be range of mountain with musical instrument in his hand crown upon his head and smile upon his face in the second similar man be scream at the pitch of his lung while half dozen black creature be batter he with pole and prod he with lance "it be damned soul and saved soul say father ignatius morat look at his picture with some satisfaction these be cloud upon which the bless spirit recline bask in all the joy of paradise it be well do this picture but it have have no good effect because there be no beaver in it and they have not paint in tobacco pipe you see they have little reason these poor folk and so we have to teach they as well we can through their eye and their foolish sense this other be well it have convert several squaw and more than one indian shall not bring back the saved soul when come in the spring but shall bring five damned soul which will be one for each nation we must fight satan with such weapon as we can get you see and now my child if you must go let i first call down blessing upon you!"and then occur strange thing for the beauty of this man 's soul shine through all the wretched cloud of sect and as he raise his hand to bless they down go those protestant knee to earth and even old ephraim find himself with softened heart and bent head listen to the half understand word of this crippled half blind little stranger "farewell then say he when they have rise may the sunshine of saint eulalie be upon you and may saint anne of beaupre shield you at the moment of your danger "and so they leave he grotesque and yet heroic figure stagger along through the wood with his tent his picture and his mutilation if the church of rome should ever be wreck it may come from her weakness in high place where all church be at their weak or it may be because with what be very narrow she try to explain that which be very broad but assuredly it will never be through the fault of her rank and file for never upon earth have man and woman spend themselves more lavishly and more splendidly than in her service leave fort st. louis whence the bell have sound upon their right they push onwards as swiftly as they could for the sun be so low in the heaven that the bush in the clearing throw shadow like tree then suddenly as they peer in front of they between the trunk the green of the sward turn to the blue of the water and they see broad river run swiftly before they in france it would have seem mighty stream but come fresh from the vastness of the st. lawrence their eye be use to great sheet of water but amos and de catinat have both be upon the bosom of the richelieu before and their heart bound as they look upon it for they know that this be the straight path which lead they the one to home and the other to peace and freedom few day journey down there few more along the lovely island stud lake of champlain and saint sacrament under the shadow of the tree clothe adirondacks and they would be at the headquarters of the hudson and their toil and their danger be but thing of gossip for the winter evening across the river be the terrible iroquois country and at two point they could see the smoke of fire curl up into the evening air they have the jesuit 's word for it that none of the war party have cross yet so they follow the track which lead down the eastern bank as they push onwards however stern military challenge suddenly bring they to stand and they see the gleam of two musket barrel which cover they from thicket overlook the path "we be friend cry de catinat "whence come you then ask an invisible sentinel "from quebec ""and whither be you going?""to visit monsieur charles de la noue seigneur of sainte marie ""very good it be quite safe du lhut they have lady with they too greet you madame in the name of my father "two man have emerge from the bush one of whom might have pass as full blooded indian have it not be for these courteous word which he utter in excellent french he be tall slight young man very dark with pierce black eye and grim square relentless mouth which could only have come with indian descent his coarse flow hair be gather up into scalp lock and the eagle feather which he wear in it be his only headgear rude suit of fringe hide with caribou skin mocassin might have be the fellow to the one which amos green be wear but the gleam of gold chain from his belt the sparkle of costly ring upon his finger and the delicate richly inlay musket which he carry all give touch of grace to his equipment broad band of yellow ochre across his forehead and tomahawk at his belt add to the strange inconsistency of his appearance the other be undoubtedly pure frenchman elderly dark and wiry with bristle black beard and fierce eager face he too be clothe in hunter 's dress but he wear gaudy stripe sash round his waist into which brace of long pistol have be thrust his buckskin tunic have be ornament over the front with dye porcupine quill and indian bead work while his legging be scarlet with fringe of raccoon tail hang down from they lean upon his long brown gun he stand watch the party while his companion advance towards they "you will excuse our precaution say he
