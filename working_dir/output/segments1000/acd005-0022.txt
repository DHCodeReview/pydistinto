and they know how suddenly the ice and snow come in those northern land and how impossible it would be to finish their journey if winter be once fairly upon they the old nobleman have send his scout by land and by water but there be no sign of the iroquois upon the eastern bank so that it be clear that de lhut have be mistaken over on the other side however the high gray plume of smoke still stream up above the tree as sign that their enemy be not very far off all day from the manor house window and from the stockade they could see those danger signal which remind they that horrible death lurk ever at their elbow the refugee be rest now and refresh and of one mind about push on "if the snow come it will be thousand time more dangerous saidamos for we shall leave track then that papoose
