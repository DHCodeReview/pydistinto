ask the little professor hand small round object to the candidate "it be an echinus sea urchin tom say triumphantly "have they any circulation ask the other examiner "a water vascular system ""describe it "tom start off fluently but it be no part of the policy of the examiner to allow he to waste the fifteen minute allot they in expatiate upon what he know well they interrupt he after few sentence "how do this creature walk ask the crab like one "by mean of long tube which it project at pleasure ""how do the tube enable the creature to walk?""they have sucker on they ""what be the sucker like?""they be round hollow disc ""are you sure they be round ask the other sharply "yes say tom stoutly though his idea on the subject be rather vague ""and how do this sucker act ask the tall examiner tom begin to feel that these two man be exhibit very unseemly curiosity there seem to be no satiate their desire for information it create vacuum he cry desperately "how do it create vacuum?""by the contraction of muscular pimple in the centre say tom in moment of inspiration "and what make this pimple contract?"tom lose his head and be about to say electricity when he happily check himself and substitute muscular action ""very good say the examiner and the student breathe again the tall one return to the charge however with and this muscle be it compose of stripe fibre or non striped?""non stripe shriek tom at venture and both examiner rub their hand and murmur very good indeed at which tom 's hair begin to lie little flat and he cease to feel as if he be in turkish bath "how many tooth have rabbit the tall man ask suddenly "i do n't know the student answer with candour the two look triumphantly at one another "he do n't know cry the goggle eye one decisively "i should recommend you to count they the next time you have one for dinner the other remark as this be evidently mean for joke tom have the tact to laugh and very gruesome and awe inspire laugh it be too then the candidate be badger about the pterodactyl and concern the difference in anatomy between bat and bird and about the lamprey and the cartilaginous fish and the amphioxus all these question he answer more or less to the satisfaction of the examiner generally less when at last the little bell tinkle which be the sign for candidate to move on to other table the tall man lean over list in front of he and mark down upon it the follow hieroglyphic s. b. ."this tom 's sharp eye at once detect and he depart well pleased for he know that the s. b. meantsatis bene and as to the minus sign after it it matter little to he whether he have do rather more than well or rather less he have pass in zoology and that be all which concern he at present but there be pitfall ahead as he move to the botany table grey bearded examiner wave his hand in the direction of the row of microscope as an intimation that the student be to look through they and pronounce upon what he see tom seem to compress his whole soul into his one eye as he glare hopelessly through the tube at what appear to he to resemble nothing so much as sheet of ice with the mark of skate upon it "come along come along the examiner growl impatiently courtesy be conspicuous by its absence in most of the edinburgh examination you must pass on to the next one unless you can offer an opinion "this venerable teacher of botany though naturally kind hearted man be well know as one of the most malignant specie of examiner one of the school which consider such an ordeal in the light of trial of strength between their pupil and themselves in his eye the candidate be endeavour to pass and his duty be to endeavour to prevent he result which in large proportion of case he successfully accomplish "hurry on hurry on he reiterate fussily "it be section of leaf say the student "it 's nothing of the sort the examiner shout exultantly you 've make bad mistake sir very bad one indeed it be the spirilloe of water plant move on to the next "tom in much perturbation of mind shuffle down the line and look through the next brazen tube this be preparation of stomata he say recognize it from print in his book on botany the professor shake his head despondingly you be right he say pass on to the next "the third preparation be as puzzle to the student as the first have be and he be steel himself to meet the inevitable when an unexpected circumstance turn the scale in his favour it chance that the other examiner be somewhat less of fossil than hisconfrere and have still vitality enough to take an interest in thing which be foreign to his subject have recognize the student as be the young hero who have damage himself in uphold the honour of his country be an ardent patriot himself his heart warm towards tom and perceive the imminent peril in which he stand he interfere in his behalf and by few lead question get he on safe ground and manage to keep he there until the little bell tinkle once more the young examiner show remarkable tact in feel his way and keep within the very limited area of the student 's knowledge he succeed so well however that although his colleague shake his hoary head and intimate in other way his poor opinion of the candidate 's acquirement he be force to put down another s. b. upon the paper in front of he the student draw long breath when he see it and march across to the other table with mixture of trepidation and confidence like jockey riding at the last and high hurdle in steeple chase alas it be the last hurdle which often floor the rider and thomas too be doom to find the final ordeal an insurmountable one as he cross the room some evil chance make he think of the gossip outside and of his allusion to the abstruse substance know as cacodyl once let candidate 's mind hit upon such an idea as this and nothing will ever get it out of his thought tom feel his head buzz round and he pass his hand over his forehead and through his curly yellow hair to steady himself he feel frenzied impulse as he sit down to inform the examiner that he know very well what they be go to ask he and that it be hopeless for he to attempt to answer it the lead professor be ruddy face benevolent old gentleman with spectacle and kindly manner he make few commonplace remark to his colleague with the good natured intention of give the confused look student before he time to compose himself then turn blandly towards he he say in the mild of tone have you ever row in pond?"tom acknowledge that he have "perhap on those occasion the examiner continue you may have chance to touch the mud at the bottom with your oar "tom agree that it be possible "in that case you may have observe that large bubble or succession of they have rise from the bottom to the surface now of what gas be that bubble composed?"the unhappy student with the one idea always ferment on his brain feel that the bad have come upon he without moment 's hesitation or think he express his conviction that the compound be cacodyl never do two man look more surprised and never do two generally gravesavantslaugh more heartily than do the two examiner when they realize what the candidate have answer their mirth speedily bring he back to his sense he see with feeling of despair that it be marsh gas which they have expect one of the simple and commonest of chemical combination alas it be too late now he know full well that nothing could save he with poor mark in botany and zoology such an error in chemistry be irreparable he do what be perhaps the good thing under the circumstance rise from his chair he make respectful bow to the examiner and walk straight out of the room to the great astonishment of the janitor who have never before witness such breach of decorum as the student close the door behind he he look back and see that the other professor have leave their respective table and be listen to an account of the incident from one of the chemist and roar of laughter the moment afterwards show that they appreciate the humour of it his fellow student gather round tom outside in the hope of share in the joke but he push they angrily aside and stride through the midst of they and down the university step he know that the story would spread fast enough without his assistance his mind be busy too in shape certain resolution which he have often think over during the last few month the two old people and miss kate harston wait long and anxiously in their sitting room at the hotel for some news of the absentee the doctor have at first attempt lofty cynicism and general assumption of indifference which rapidly break down as the time go by until at last he be wander round the room drum upon the furniture with his finger and show every other sign of acute impatience the window be on the first floor and kate have be station there as sentinel to watch the pass crowd and signal the first sign of tiding "can't you see he yet the doctor ask for the twentieth time "no dear do n't she answer glance up and down the street "he must be out now he should have come straight to we come away from the window my dear we must not let the young monkey see how anxious we be about he "kate sit down by the old man and stroke his broad brown hand with her tender white one do n't be uneasy dear she say it be sure to be all right ""yes he be sure to pass the doctor answer but bless my soul who be this?"the individual who cause this exclamation be very broad faced and rosy cheek little girl coarsely clothe with pile of book and slate under her arm who have suddenly enter the apartment "please sir say this apparition with bob be sarah jane ""are you indeed say the doctor with mild irony and what d'ye want here sarah jane?""please sir my mithar mrs. mctavish ask i if wudna gie ye this letter frae the gentleman what be lodgin wi she with these word the little mite deliver her missive and having give another bob depart upon her way "why the doctor cry in astonishment it be direct to i and intom 's writing what can be the meaning of this?""oh dear oh dear mrs. dimsdale cry with the quick perception of womanhood it mean that he have fail ""impossible say the doctor fumble with nervous finger at the envelope by jove though he continue as he glance over the content you be right he have poor lad he be more cut up about it than we can be so we must not blame he "the good physician read the letter over several time before he finally put it away in his note book and he do so with thoughtful face which show that it be of importance as it have an influence upon the future course of our story we can not end the chapter well than by exercise our literary privilege and peep over the doctor 's shoulder before he have fold it up this be the epistlein extenso my dear father,"you will be sorry to hear that have fail in my exam be very cut up about it because fear that it will cause you grief and disappointment and you deserve neither the one nor the other at my hand ""it be not an unmixed misfortune to i because it help i to make request which have long have in my mind wish you to allow i to give up the study of medicine and to go in for commerce you have never make secret of our money affair to i and know that if take my degree there would never be any necessity for i to practise should therefore have spend five year of my life in acquire knowledge which would not be of any immediate use to i have no personal inclination towards medicine while have very strong objection to simply live in the world upon money which other man have earn must therefore turn to some fresh pursuit for my future career and surely it would be good that should do so at once what that fresh pursuit be to be leave to your judgment personally think that if embark my capital in some commercial undertaking might by stick to my work do well feel too much cast down at my own failure to see you to night but to morrow hope to hear what you think from your own lip tom.""perhap this failure will do no harm after all the doctor mutter thoughtfully as he fold up the letter and gaze out at the cold glare of the northern sunset the residence of major tobias clutterbuck late of the 119th light infantry be not know to any of his friend it be true that at time he allude in modest way to his little place and even go to the length of remark airily to new acquaintance that he hope they would look he up any time they happen to be in his direction as he carefully refrain however from ever give the slight indication of which direction that might be his invitation never lead to any practical result still they have the effect of fill the recipient with vague sense of proffer hospitality and occasionally lead to more substantial kindness in return the gallant major 's figure be familiar one in the card room of therag and bobtail at the bow window of the jeunesse doree tall and pompous with portly frame and puffy clean shaven face which peer over an abnormally high collar and old fashioned linen cravat he stand as very type and emblem of staid middle aged respectability the major 's hat be always of the glossy the major 's coat be without wrinkle and in short from the summit of the major 's bald head to his bulbous finger tip and his gouty toe there be not flaw which the most severe critic of deportment even the illustrious turveydrop himself could have detect let we add that the conversation of the major be as irreproachable as his person that he be distinguished soldier and an accomplished traveller with retentive memory and mind stuff with the good thing of lifetime combine all these quality and one would naturally regard the major as most desirable acquaintance it be painful to have to remark however that self evident as this proposition might appear it be vehemently contradict by some of the initiate there be rumour concern the major which seriously compromise his private character indeed such pitch have they reach that when that gallant officer put himself forward as candidate for certain select club he have although propose by lord and second by baronet be most ignominiously pille in public the major affect to laugh over this social failure and to regard it as somewhat in the nature of practical joke but privately he be deeply incense one day he momentarily drop his veil of unconcern while play billiard with the honourable fungus brown who be generally credit with having have some hand in the major 's exclusion be ged sir the veteran suddenly exclaim inflate his chest and turn his apoplectic face upon his companion in the old day would have call the lot of you out sir every demne one begin with the committee and work down would be george at which savage attack the honourable fungus 's face grow as white as the major 's be red and he begin to wish that he have be more reserved in his confidence to some of his acquaintance respect the exclusiveness of the club in question or at least refrain from hold up the major 's pilling as proof thereof the cause of this vague feeling of distrust which have go abroad concern the old soldier be no very easy matter to define it be true that he be know to have book on every race and to have secret mean of information from stud groom and jockey which occasionally stand he in good stead but this be no uncommon thing among the man with whom he consort again it be true that major clutterbuck be much addicted to whist with guinea point and to billiard match for substantial sum but these stimulate recreation be also habitual to many man who have lead eventful life and require strong seasoning to make ordinary existence endurable perhaps one reason may have be that the major 's billiard play in public varied to an extraordinary degree so that on different occasion he have appear to be aim at the process term by the initiate get on the money the warm friendship too which the old soldier have contract with sundry vacuous and sappy youth who be kindly pilot by he into quasi fashionable life and show how and when to spend their money have be most uncharitably comment upon perhaps the vagueness about the major 's private residence and the mystery which hang over he outside his club may also have excite prejudice against he still however his detractor might malign he they could not attempt to deny the fact that tobias clutterbuck be the third son of the honourable charles clutterbuck who again be the second son of the earl of dunross one of the most ancient of hibernian family this pedigree the old soldier take care to explain to every one about he more particularly to the sappy youth aforementione it chance that on the afternoon of which we speak the major be engross by this very subject stand at the head of the broad stone step which lead up to the palatial edifice which its occupier irreverently term therag and bobtail he be explain to bull necked olive complexion young man the series of marriage and inter marriage which have culminate in the production of his own portly stiff back figure his companion who be none other than ezra girdlestone of the great african firm of that name lean against one of the pillar of the portico and listen gloomily to the major 's family reminiscence give an occasional yawn which he make no attempt to conceal "it be as plain as the finger of i hand the old soldier say in wheezy muffled brogue as if he be speak from under feather bed see here now girdlestone this be miss letitia snackles of snackleton cousin of old sir joseph the major tap his thumb with the silver head of
