would have strike the old merchant see it now you have be speculate on your own hook you curse ass what have you do with it he seize his father by the collar and shake he furiously in his wrath "keep

they might imagine that we be suffer from some temporary depression of trade but no one could possibly know the sad truth for heaven 's sake do n't you let it out!"his son break into an impatient oath flush come into girdlestone 's sallow cheek and his eye sparkle angrily "be careful how you speak ezra there be limit to what will endure from you though make every allowance for your feeling at this sudden catastrophe for which acknowledge myself responsible "the young man shrug his shoulder and drum his heel against the ground impatiently "i have more than one plan in my head the merchant say by which our affair may be re establish on their old footing if we can once get sufficient money to satisfy our present creditor and so tide over this run of bad luck the current will set in the other way and all will go well and first of all there be one question my boy which should like to ask you what do you think of john harston 's daughter?""she be right enough the young man answer brusquely "she be good girl ezra thoroughly good girl and rich girl too though her money be small thing in my eye compare to her virtue "young girdlestone sneer of course he say impatiently well go on what about her?""just this ezra that there be no girl in the world whom should like well to receive as my daughter in law ah you rogue you could come round she you know you could the old man poke his long bony finger in the direction of his son 's rib with grim playfulness "oh that be the idea be it remark the junior partner with very unpleasant smile "yes that be one way out of our difficulty she have forty thousand pound which would be more than enough to save the firm at the same time you would gain charming wife ""yes there be good many girl about who might make charming wife his son remark dubiously no matrimony for i yet awhile ""but it be absolutely necessary his father urge "a very fine necessity ezra break in savagely be to tie myself up for life and you be to use all the money in rectify your blunder it be very pretty division of labour be that ""the business be yours as well as mine it be your interest to invest the money in it for if it fail you be as completely ruin as should be you think you could win she if you tried?"ezra stroke his dark moustache complacently and take momentary glance at his own bold handsome feature in the mirror above the fire place if we be reduce to such an expedient think can answer for the result he say the girl be not bad look one but you say you have several plan let we hear some of the other one if the bad come to the bad might consent to that on condition of course that should have the whole management of the money ""quite so quite so his father say hurriedly that be dear good lad as you say when all other thing fail we can always fall back upon that at present intend to raise as much money as can upon our credit and invest it in such manner as to bring in large and immediate profit ""and how do you intend to do this his son ask doubtfully "i intend say john girdlestone solemnly rise up and lean his elbow against the mantelpiece intend to make corner in diamond "john girdlestone propound his intention with such dignity and emphasis that he evidently expect the announcement to come as surprise upon his son if so he be not disappointed for the young man stare open eyed "a corner in diamond he repeat how will you do that?""you know what corner be his father explain if you buy up all the cotton say or sugar in the market so as to have the whole of it in your own hand and to be able to put your own price on it in sell it again that be call make corner in sugar or cotton intend to make corner in diamond ""of course know what corner be ezra say impatiently but how on earth be you go to buy all the diamond in you would want the capital of rothschild?""not so much as you think my boy for there be not any great amount of diamond in the market at any one time the yield of the south african field regulate the price have have this idea in my head for some time and have study the detail of course should not attempt to buy in all the diamond that be in the market small portion of they would yield profit enough to float the firm off again ""but if you have only part of the supply in your hand how be you to regulate the market value you must come down to the price at which other holder be sell ""ha ha very good very good the old merchant say shake his head good humouredly but you do n't quite see my plan yet you have not altogether grasp it allow i to explain it to you "his son lie back upon the sofa with look of resignation upon his face girdlestone continue to stand upon the hearth rug and speak very slowly and deliberately as though give vent to thought which have be long and carefully consider "you see ezra he say diamond be commodity of great value of which there be never very much in the market at one time be extremely sensitive to all sort of influence the value of they vary greatly from time to time very little thing serve to depreciate their price and an equally small thing will send it up again "ezra girdlestone grunt to show that he follow his father 's remark "i do some business in diamond myself when be young man and so have an opportunity of observe their fluctuation in the market now there be one thing which invariably depreciate the price of diamond that be the rumour of fresh discovery of mine in other part of the world the instant such thing get wind the value of the stone go down wonderfully the discovery of diamond in central india not long ago have that effect very markedly and they have never recover their value since do you follow me?"an expression of interest have come over ezra 's face and he nod to show that he be listen "now suppose continue the senior partner with smile on his thin lip that such report get about suppose too that we be at this time when the market be in depressed condition to invest considerable capital in they if these rumour of an alleged discovery turn out to be entirely unfounded of course the value of the stone which we hold would go up once more and we might very well sell out for double or treble the sum that we invest do n't you see the sequence of events?""there seem to i to be rather too much of the suppose in it remark ezra how do we know that such rumour will get about and if they do how do we know that they will prove to be unfounded?""how be we to know the merchant cry wriggle his long lank body with amusement why my lad if we spread the rumour ourselves we shall have pretty good reason to believe that they be unfounded eh ezra ha ha you see there be some brain in the old man yet "ezra look at his father in considerable surprise and some admiration why damn it he exclaim it be dishonest be not sure that it be not actionable ""dishonest pooh the merchant snap his finger it be finesse my boy commercial finesse who be to trace it should like to know have n't work out all the detail want your co operation over that but here be rough sketch of my plan we send man we can depend upon to some distant part of the world chimborazo for example or the ural mountains it do n't matter where as long as it be out of the way on arrive at this place our agent start report that he have discover diamond mine we should even go the length if he consider it necessary of hide few rough stone in the earth which he can dig up to give colour to his story of course the local press would be full of this he might present one of the diamond to the editor of the near paper in course of time pretty coloured description of the new diamond field would find its way to london and thence to the cape 'll answer for it that the immediate effect be great drop in the price of stone we should have second agent at the cape diamond field and he would lay our money out by buy in all that he could while the panic last then the original scare having prove to be all mistake the price naturally go up once more and we get long figure for all that we hold that be what mean by make corner in diamond there be no room in it for any miscalculation it be as certain as proposition of euclid and as easily work out ""it sound very nice his son remark thoughtfully be not so sure about its working though ""it must work well as far as human calculation can go there be no possibility of failure besides my boy never lose sight of the fact that we shall be speculate with other people 's money we ourselves have nothing to lose absolutely nothing ""i be not likely to lose sight of it say ezra angrily his mind come back to his grievance "i reckon that we can raise from forty to fifty thousand pound without much difficulty my name be as you know as good as that of any firm in the city for nearly forty year it have be above stain or suspicion if we carry on our plan at once and lie this money out judiciously all may come right ""it 's hobson 's choice the young man remark we must try some boldstroke of the sort have you choose the right sort of man for agents?you should have man of some standing to set such report go they would have more weight then "john girdlestone shake his head despondingly how be to get man of any standing to do such piece of business he say "nothing easy answer ezra with cynical laugh could pick out score of impecunious fellow from the club who would be only too glad to earn hundred or two in any way you can mention all their talk about honour and so forth be very pretty and edify but it be not mean for every day use of course we should have to pay he ""them you mean?""no we should only want one man ""how about our purchaser at the diamond fields?""you do n't mean to say ezra say roughly that you would be so absurd as to trust any man with our money why would n't let the archbishop of canterbury out of my sight with forty thousand pound of mine no shall go myself to the diamond field that is if can trust you here alone ""that be unkind ezra say his father your idea be an excellent one should have propose it myself but for the discomfort and hardship of such journey ""there be no use do thing by half the young man remark as to our other agent have the very man major tobias clutterbuck he be shrewd clever fellow and he be always hard up last week he want to borrow tenner from i the job would be godsend to he and his social rank would be great help to our plan 'll answer for his jumping at the idea ""sound he on the subject then ""i will ""i be glad say the old merchant that you and have have this conversation ezra the fact of my having speculate without your knowledge and deceive you by false ledger have often weigh heavily upon my conscience assure you it be relief to i to have tell you all ""drop the subject then ezra say curtly must put up with it for have no redress the thing be do and nothing can undo it but consider that you have willfully waste the money ""believe i have try to act for the good the good name of our firm be everything to i have spend my whole life in build it up and if the day should come when it must go trust that may have go myself there be nothing which would not do to preserve it ""i see they want our premium ezra say glance at the open letter upon the table how be it that none of those ship go down that would give we help ""hush hush john girdlestone cry imploringly speak in whisper when you talk of such thing ""i ca n't understand you say ezra petulantly you persistently over insure your ship year after year look at theleopard it be put at more than twice what she be worth as new and theblack eagle dare say be about the same yet you never have an accident with they while your two new uninsured clipper run each other down ""well what more can do reply the merchant they be thoroughly rotten have do nothing for they for year soon or later they must go can not do any more ""i'd make 'em go down quick enough mutter ezra with an oath "why do n't you make old miggs bear hole in they or put light to abarrel of paraffin bless your soul the thing be do every day what be the use of be milk and watery about it?""no no ezra cry his father not that not that it be one thing let matter take their course and it be another thing give positive order to scuttle ship besides it would put we in miggs power it would be too dangerous ""please yourself say ezra with sneer you 've get we into the mess and you must take we out again if the bad come to the bad 'll tell you what 'll do 'll marry kate harston wash my hand of the firm leave you to settle matter with the creditor and retire with the forty thousand pound with which threat the junior partner take up his hat and swagger out of the office after his departure john girdlestone spend an hour in anxious thought arrange the detail of the scheme which he have just submit to his son as he sit his eye chance to fall upon the two letter lie on his desk and it strike he that they have well be attend to it do not suit his plan to fall back upon his credit just yet it have be already show that he be man of ready resource he ring the bell and summon his senior clerk "good morning john he say affably "good

say "yes sir fifteen hundred pound sir less legacy duty and incidental expense fourteen hundred and twenty eight six and fourpence my wife 's brother andrew leave it sir and very handsome legacy too "john girdlestone smile with the indulgent smile of one to whom such sum be absolutely nothing "what have you do with the money then john he ask carelessly "banked it sir in the united metropolitan ""in the united metropolitan john let i see their present rate of interest be three and half?""three sir say john "three dear i john that be poor interest very poor indeed it be most fortunate that make these inquiry be on the point of draw fourteen hundred pound from one of my correspondent as temporary convenience for this should pay he five per cent have no objection john as you be an old servant of the firm to give you the preference in this matter can not take more than fourteen hundred but shall be happy to accommodate you up to that sum at the rate name "john gilray be overwhelm by this thoughtful and considerate act it be really too generous and kind sir he say do n't know how to thank you ""don't mention it john the senior partner say grandly the firm be always glad to advance the interest of its employee in any reasonable manner have you your cheque book with you fill it up for fourteen hundred no more john can not oblige you by take any more "the head clerk having make out his cheque for the amount and having sign his name to it in cramp little quaint handwriting which remind one of his person be duly present with receipt and dismiss to his counting house there he entertain the other clerk by glowing description of the magnanimity of his employer john girdlestone take some sheet of blue official paper from drawer and his quill pen travel furiously over they with many screech and splutter "sir he say to the bank manager enclose fourteen hundred pound which represent the loose cash about the office shall make heavy deposit presently in the meantime you

create in diamond john girdlestone 's private residence in eccleston square be large and substantial house in district which the wave of fashion have pass over in its westward course it might still however be say to be cover by deposit of eminent respectability the building be stern and hard and massive in its external appearance but the interior be luxury itself for the old merchant in spite of his ascetic appearance be inclined to be sybarite at heart and have due appreciation of the good thing of this world indeed there be an oriental and almost barbarous splendour about the great room where the rich of furniture be intersperse with skin from the gaboon hand work ivory from old calabar and the thousand other strange valuable which be present by his agent to the african trader after the death of his friend girdlestone have be as good as his word he have take kate harston away from the desolate house at fulham and bring she to live with he from the garret of that palatial edifice to the cellar she be at liberty to roam where she would and do what she choose the square garden
