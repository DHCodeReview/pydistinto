my whole life have teach i that when you be in doubt upon any subject you can ask ezra for assistance and advice he be young man whom you might well take as an example for he have great business capacity when he have go to africa you can come to i if there be anything which you do not understand john girdlestone appear to be so kindly and benevolent during this and other interview that tom 's heart warm towards he and he come to the conclusion that his father have judge the old merchant harshly more than once so impressed be he by his kindness that he be on the point of disclose to he his engagement to his ward but on each occasion there arise within he lively recollection of kate 's frightened face when he have suggest such course and he feel that without her consent he have no right to divulge the secret if the eld girdlestone improve upon acquaintance it be exactly the reverse with his son ezra the dislike with which tom have originally regard he deepen as he come in close contact and appear to be reciprocate by the other so that they hold but little intercourse together ezra have take into his own charge all the financial part of the concern and guard it the more jealously when he realize that the new partner be so much less simple than he have expect thus tom have no opportunity of ascertain for himself how the affair of the firm stand but believe implicitly as do gilray that every outlay be bring in large and remunerative return very much astonished would both of they have be have they realize that the working expense be at present be pay entirely from their own capital until such time as the plot should ripen which be to restore the fortune of the african company in one respect tom dimsdale be immeasurably the gainer by his connection with the firm for without that it be difficult to say how he could have find opportunity for break through the barrier which separate he from kate the surveillance of the merchant have become strict of late and all invitation from mrs. dimsdale or other friend who pity the loneliness of the girl be repulse by girdlestone with the curt intimation that his ward 's health be not such as to justify he in allow she to incur any risk of catch chill she be practically prisoner in the great stone cage in eccleston square and even on she walk warder in the shape of footman be as we have seen tell off to guard she whatever john girdlestone 's reason may have be he have evidently come to the conclusion that it be of the high importance that she should be keep seclude as it be tom thank to his position as one of the firm be able occasionally in spite of every precaution to penetrate through the old man 's defensive work if question of importance arise at fenchurch street during the absence of the senior partner what more natural than that mr. dimsdale should volunteer to walk round to eccleston square in order to acquaint he with the fact and if it happen that the gentleman be not to be find there how very natural that the young man should wait half an hour for he and that miss harston should take the opportunity of chat with an old friend precious precious interview those the more so for their rarity they brighten the dull routine of kate 's weary life and send tom back to the office full of spirit and hope the day be at hand when the memory of they be to shine out like little rift of light in the dark cloud of existence and now the time be come when it be to be decide whether by last bold stroke the credit of the house of girdlestone be to be save or whether the attempt be to plunge they into deep and more hopeless ruin an unscrupulous agent name langworthy have as already indicate be despatch to russia well prime with instruction as to what to do and how to do it he have be in the employ of an english corn merchant at odessa and have some knowledge of the russian language which would be invaluable to he in his undertaking in the character of an english gentleman of scientific taste he be to establish himself in some convenient village among the ural mountains there he be to remain some little time so as to arouse confidence in the people before make his pretended discovery he be then to carry his rough diamond to tobolsk as the near large town and to exhibit they there back up his assertion by the evidence of villager who have see he dig they up the girdlestones know that that alone would be sufficient when telegraph to england to produce panic in the sensitive diamond market before any systematic inquiry could be make langworthy would have disappear and their little speculation would have come off after that the soon the people realize that it be hoax the well for the conspirator in any case there seem to be no possibility that the origin of the rumour could be trace meanwhile ezra girdlestone have secure his passage in the cape mail steamercyprian on the night that he leave he sit up late in the library at eccleston square talk over the matter for the last time with his father the old man be pale and nervous the one weak point in his character be his affection for his son an affection which he strove to hide under an austere manner but which be none the less genuine he have never before part with he for any length of time and he feel the wrench keenly as to ezra he be flushed and excited at the thought of the new scene

and then he throw open the window and gaze sorrowfully down the street at the disappear cab his whole attitude express such dejection that his ward who have just enter the room feel more draw towards he than she have ever do before slip up to he she place her warm tender hand upon his sympathetically "he will soon be back dear mr. girdlestone she say you must not be uneasy about he "as she stand
