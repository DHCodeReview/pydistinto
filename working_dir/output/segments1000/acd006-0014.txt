much come on it be the capetown road hundred pound if we catch them!""three roar the sergeant right half turn trot the crowd split asunder and the little troop with ezra at their head clove path through they gallop shout the sergeant and away they clatter down the high street of kimberley strike fire out of the stone and splash up the gravel until the sound of their hoofs die away into dull subdue rattle and finally fade altogether from the ear of the listening crowd for the first few mile the party gallop in silence the moon be still shine brilliantly and they could see the white line of the road stretch out in front of they and wind away over the undulating veldt to right and leave spread broad expanse of wiry grass stretch to the horizon with low bush and scrub scatter over it in patch here and there be group of long legged unhealthy look sheep who crash through the bush in wild terror as the rider sweep by they their plaintive call be the only sound which break the silence of the night save the occasional dismal hooting of the veldt owl ezra on his powerful grey have be ride somewhat ahead of the trooper but the sergeant manage to get abreast of he beg pardon sir he say raise his hand to his kepi but do n't you think this pace be too good to last the horse will be blow ""as long as we catch they ezra answer do n't care what become of the horse would soon stand you dozen horse apiece than let they get away "the young merchant 's word be firm and his seat steady in spite of the throbbing at his head the fury in his heart supply he with strength and he gnaw his moustache in his impatience and dig his spur into his horse 's flank until the blood trickle down its glossy coat fortune reputation above all revenge all depend upon the issue of this headlong chase through the darkness the sergeant and ezra gallop along leather to leather and rein to rein while the troop clatter in their rear there be combrink about two mile far on say the sergeant we will hear news of they there ""they ca n't get off the high road can they?""not likely sir they could n't get along as fast anywhere else indeed it be hardly safe riding across the veldt they might be down pit

catch something of his companion 's enthusiasm at this pace if the horse hold out we might catch they before morning there be the light of the shanty "as he speak they be gallop round long curve in the road at the further end of which there be feeble yellow glimmer as they come abreast of it they see that the light come through an open door in the centre of which burly afrikaner be stand with his hand in his breech pocket and his pipe in his mouth "good evening say the sergeant as his man pull up their reek horse have any one pass this way before us?""many tausand have pass this way before

their horse ""that'll do ezra shout and away they go once more down the broad white road they pass bluewater 's drift at two in the morning and be at van hayden 's farm at half past at three they leave the modder river far behind they and at quarter past four they sweep down the main street of the little township of jacobsdal their horse weak and weary and all mottle with foam there be police patrol in the street "has any one pass cry the sergeant "three man quarter of an hour ago ""have they go on?""straight on their horse be nearly dead beat though ""come on cry ezra eagerly come

more on their wild career rouse the quiet burgher of jacobsdal by the wild turmoil of their hoofs out once more upon the port elizabeth road it be clear race between the pursuer and the pursued the former know that the fugitive be it daytime would possibly be within sight of they and the thought give they additional ardour the sergeant have fresh horse ride in front his head down and his body forward get every possible inch of pace out of the animal at his heel come ezra on his gallant grey the blood stain handkerchief flutter from his head he be sit very straight in his saddle with set stern smile upon his lip in his right hand he hold cocked revolver hundred yard or so behind they the two remain trooper came toil along upon their weary nag work hard with whip and spur to stimulate they to further exertion away in the east long rosy streak lie low upon the horizon which show that dawn be approach and grey light steal over the landscape suddenly the sergeant pull his horse up "there be some one come towards we he cry ezra and the trooper halt their panting steed through the uncertain light they see solitary horseman ride down the road at first they have think that it might possibly be one of the fugitive who have turn but as he come near they perceive that it be stranger his clothe be so dusty and his horse so foam fleck and weary that it be evident that he also have leave many long mile of road behind he "have you see three man on horseback cry ezra as he approach "i speak to they the traveller answer they be about half mile ahead ""come on come on ezra shout "i be bring news from jagersfontein the man say "come on ezra interrupt furiously and the horse stretch their stiff limb into feeble lumber gallop ezra and the sergeant shoot to the front and the other follow as well they might suddenly in the stillness they hear far away dull rattle sound like the clatter of distant castanet it be their horse hoofs cry ezra and the trooper behind raise cheer to show that they too understand the significance of the sound it be wild lonely spot where the plain be bare even of the scanty foliage which usually cover it here and there great granite rock protrude from the brown soil as though nature 's covering have in bygone day be rent until her gaunt bone protrude through the wound as ezra and the sergeant sweep round sharp turn in the road they see some little way ahead of they the three fugitive envelop in cloud of dust almost at the same moment they hear shout and crash behind they and look round see confused heap upon the ground the horse of the lead trooper have fall from pure fatigue and have roll over upon its rider the other trooper have dismount and be endeavour to extricate his companion "let we see if he be hurt the sergeant cry "on on shout ezra whose passion be increase by the sight of the thief not foot back ""he may have break his neck grumble the sergeant draw his revolver have your pistol ready sir we shall be up with they in few minute and they may show fight "they be up with they rather soon than the policeman expect farintosh find that speed be of no avail and that the number of his pursuer be now reduce to two have recourse to strategy there be sharp turn in the road hundred yard ahead and on reach it the three fling themselves off their horse and lie down behind cover as ezra and the sergeant the grey horse and the bay came thunder round the curve there be fierce splutter of pistol shot from amongst the bush and the grey sink down upon its knee with sob moan strike mortally in the head ezra spring to his foot and rush at the ambuscade while the sergeant who have be graze on the cheek by the first volley jump from his horse and follow he burt and farintosh meet they foot to foot with all the saxon gallantry which underlie the saxon brutality burt stab at the sergeant and strike he through the muscle of the neck farintosh fire at the policeman and be himself shoot down by ezra burt see his companion fall spring past his two assailant with vicious side blow at the merchant and throw himself upon the sergeant 's horse regardless of bullet from the latter 's revolver he gallop away and be speedily out of range as to williams from the beginning of the skirmish he have lain face downward upon the ground twist his thin limb about in an agony of fear and howl for mercy "he be go ezra say ruefully gaze after the fugitive we have nothing to go after he with ""i'm well nigh go myself say the policeman mop up the blood from his stab which be more painful than dangerous he have give i nasty prod ""never mind my friend you shall not be the loser get up you little viper this to williams who be still writhe himself into the most extraordinary attitude "oh please mr. girdlestone he cry clutch at ezra 's boot with his long thin finger it be n't i that hit you it be mr. burt have nothing to do with rob you either that be mr. farintosh would n't have go with he only know that he be clergyman so expect no harm be surprised at you mr. farintosh really be be very glad that mr. girdlestone have shoot you "the ex parson be sit with his back against gnarl stump which give he some support he have his hand to his chest and as he breathe ghastly whistle sound come from the wound and spirt of blood rush from his mouth his glaze eye be fix upon the man who have shoot he and curious smile play about his thin lip "come here mr. girdlestone he croak come here "ezra stride over to he with face as inexorable as fate "you've do for i say farintosh faintly it be queer end for the good man of his year at trinity master of art sir and jacksonian prizeman not much worth now be it who 'd have think then that should have die like dog in this wilderness what be the odd how man die though if have keep myself straight should have go off few year later in feather bed as the dean of st. patrick 's may be what will that matter 've enjoy myself the die man 's eye glisten at the thought of past dissipation if have my time to do over again he continue 'd enjoy myself the same way be not penitent sir no death bed snivel about i or short cut into heaven that be not what want to say though have choking in the throat but dare say you can hear what be drive at you meet man ride towards jacobsdal do you not?"ezra nod sullenly "you do n't speak to he too busy try to catch yours truly eh will you have your stone back for they be in the bag by my side but they 'll not be very much good to you the little spec wo n't come off this time you do n't know what the news be that the man be bringing?"a vague feeling of impending misfortune steal over ezra he shake his head "his news be say farintosh lean up upon his hand that fresh diamond fieldshavebeen discover at jagersfontein in the orange free state so russia or no russia stone will not rise ha ha will not rise look at his face it be whiter than mine ha ha ha with the laugh upon his lip great flow of blood stop the clergyman 's utterance and he roll slowly over upon his side dead man during the month which ezra girdlestone have spend in africa the affair of the firm in fenchurch street have be exceedingly prosperous trade upon the coast have be brisker than usual and three of the company 's ship have come in at short interval with excellent cargo among these be theblack eaglewhich to the astonishment of captain hamilton miggs and the disgust of his employer have weather severe gale in the channel and have arrive safe and sound once more this run of luck supplement by the business capacity of the old merchant and the indomitable energy of young dimsdale make the concern look so flourish that the former feel more than ever convince that if he could but stave off the immediate danger thing would soon right themselves hence he read with delight the letter from africa in which his son narrate the success of the conspiracy and the manner in which the miner have be hoodwink the old man 's figure grow straight and his step more firm as the conviction grow upon he that the company would soon return once again to its former condition of affluence it may be imagine therefore that when the rumour of bona fide diamond find in the orange free state come to his ear john girdlestone be much agitated and distressed on the same day that he see the announcement in the paper he receive letter from his son announce the failure of their enterprise after narrate the robbery the pursuit the death of farintosh and the announcement of the new discovery it give an account of his subsequent movement "there be no doubt about the truth of the scoundrel 's word he say for when we go to the near farm to get some food and have the sergeant 's wound dress we find that every one be talk about it there be chap there who have just come from the state and know all about it after hear the detail from he see that there be no doubt of the genuineness of the thing "the police ride back to jacobsdal with williams and promise to come after they but when come to think it over it do n't seem good enough the fact of my have so many diamond would set every tongue wagging and again the sergeant have hear what farintosh say to i so it be very possible that might have the whole district about my ear as it be have the stone and all my money in the bag write back to the hotel therefore tell the landlord to send on my trap to cape town by mail and promise to settle my bill with he when receive they then buy horse and come straight south shall take the first steamer and be with you within few day of your receive this "as to our speculation it be of course all up even when the russian business prove to be hoax the price of stone will remain very low on account of these new field it be possible that we may sell our lot at some small profit but it wo n't be the royal road to fortune that you prophesy nor will it help the firm out of the rut into which you have shove it my only regret in leave africa like this be that that vermin williams will have no one to prosecute he my head be almost well now "this letter be rude shock to the african merchant within week of the receipt of it his son ezra gloomy and travel stain walk into the sanctum at fenchurch street and confirm all the evil tiding by word of mouth the old man be of too tough fibre to break down completely but his bony hand close convulsively upon the arm of the chair and cold perspiration break out upon his wrinkle forehead as he listen to such detail as his son vouchsafe to afford he "you have your stone all safe though he stammer out at last "they be in my box at home say ezra gloomy and morose lean against the white marble mantelpiece the lord know what they be worth we 'll be lucky if we clear as much as they cost and margin for my expense and langworthy 's broken head be all that have get from your fine scheme ""who could foresee such thing the old man say plaintively he might have add major clutterbuck 's thousand pound as another item to be clear but he think it as well to keep silent upon the point "any fool could foresee the possibility of it quoth ezra brusquely "the fall in price be sure to be permanent then the old man ask "it will last for some year any way ezra answer the jagersfontein gravel be very rich and there seem to be plenty of it ""and within few month we must repay both capital and interest we be ruin the old merchant speak in broken voice and his head sink upon his breast when that day come he continue the firm which have be for thirty year above reproach and model to the whole city will be proclaim as bankrupt concern worse still it will be show to have be keep afloat for year by mean which will be deem fraudulent tell you my dear son that if any mean could be devise which would avert this anymean should not hesitate to adopt they be frail old man and feel that the short balance of my life would be small thing for i to give in return for the assurance that the work which have build up should not be altogether throw away ""your life can not affect the matter one way or the other unless it be more heavily insured than it be ezra say callously though somewhat move by his father 's intensity of manner perhaps there be some way out of the wood yet he add in more cheerful tone "it be so paying so prosperous that be what go to my heart if it have ruin itself it would be easy to bear it but it be sacrifice to outside speculation my wretched wretched speculation that be what make it so hard he touch the bell and gilray answer the summon listen to this ezra what be our turn over last month gilray?""fifteen thousand pound sir say the little clerk bob up and down like buoy in gale in his delight at see the junior partner once again "and the expenses?""nine thousand three hundred uncommon brown you look mr. ezra to be sure uncommon brown and well hope as you enjoy yourself in africa sir and be too much for they hottenpots and boars with this profound ethnological remark mr. gilray bob himself out of the room and go back radiantly to his ink stain desk "look at that the old man say when the click of the outer door show that the clerk be out of ear shot over five thousand profit in month be it not terrible that such business should go to ruin what fortune it would have be for you!""by heavens it must be save cry ezra with meditative brow and hand plunge deep in his trouser pocket there be that girl 's money could we not get the temporary use of it ""impossible his father answer with sigh it be so tie up in the will that she can not sign it away herself until she come of age there be no way of touch it except by her marriage or by her death ""then we must have it by the only mean open to we ""and that is?""i must marry she ""you will?""i shall here be my hand on it ""then we be save cry the old man throw up his tremulous hand "girdlestone son will weather the storm yet ""but girdlestone become sleep partner say ezra it be for my own sake do it and not for yours with which frank remark he draw his hat down over his brow and set off for eccleston square during ezra girdlestone 's absence in africa our heroine 's life have be even less eventful than of old there be consistency about the merchant 's establishment which be characteristic of the man the house itself be austere and gloomy and every separate room in spite of profuse expenditure and gorgeous furniture have the same air of discomfort the servant too be with one single exception from the hard visage housekeeper to the calvinistic footman depressing and melancholy race the only departure from this general rule be kate 's own maid rebecca taylforth loudly dress dark eyed coarse voice young woman who raise up her voice and weep when ezra depart for africa this damsel 's presence be most disagreeable to kate and indeed to john girdlestone also who only retain she on account of his son 's strong view upon the subject and out of fear of an explosion which might wreck all his plan the old merchant be kate 's only companion during this period and their conversation be usually limit to conventional inquiry at breakfast time as to each other 's health on his return from the city in the evening girdlestone be always in moody humour and would eat his dinner hastily and in silence after dinner he be in the habit of read methodically the various financial article in the day 's paper which would occupy he until bedtime occasionally his companion would read these aloud to he and such be the monotony of her uneventful life that she find herself become insensibly interested in the fluctuation of grand trunk scrip or ohio and delaware share the paper once exhaust bell be rung to summon the domestic and when all be assemble the merchant in hard metallic voice read through the lesson for the day and the evening prayer on grand occasion he supplement this by short address in the course of which he would pelt his frightened audience with hard jagged text until he have reduce they to fitting state of spiritual misery no wonder that under the influence of such an existence the rose begin to fade from his ward 's cheek and her youthful heart to grow sad and heavy one daily tonic there be however which never desert she strictly as girdlestone guard she and jealously as he fence she off from the outer world he be unable to prevent this one little ray of light penetrate her prison with an eye to the future he have so place she that it seem to he to be impossible that any sympathy could reach she from the outside world visit and visitor be alike forbid to she on no consideration be she to venture out alone in spite of all his precaution however love have many art and wile which defy all opposition and which can outplot the deep of plotter eccleston square be by no mean in direct line between kensington and the city yet morning and evening as sure as the clock point to half past nine and to quarter to six tom would stride through the old fashioned square and past the grim house whose grimness be soften to his eye through its association with the bright dream of his life it be but the momentary glance of sweet face at the upper window and single wave of white hand but it send he on with fresh
