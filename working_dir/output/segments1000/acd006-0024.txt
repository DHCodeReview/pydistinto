have hurl it against the wall where it splinter to piece send strong turpentiney odour through the apartment her strength be so impaired that she stagger back after this feat and sit down on the side of the bed while her guardian grim and threatening stand over she with his long bony finger open and shut as though he find it difficult to keep they from her throat "i will not help you in it she say

the girl add eagerly see here be my watch and my chain you shall have that if you will let i through?""let 's see it he open it and examine it critically "eighteen carat it be only geneva though what

look eagerly round and spy small piece which lie among the brushwood with cry of joy she pick it out it be very coarse and very dirty but she manage to scrawl few line upon it describe her situation and ask for aid will write the address upon the back she say when you get to bedsworth you must buy an envelope and ask the post office people to copy the address on to it ""i bargain to post it for the geneva he say do n't bargain to buy envelope and copy address that be nice pencil case of yourn now 'll make clean job of it if you 'll throw that in "kate hand it over without murmur at last small ray of light seem to be find its way through the darkness which have so long surround she stevens put the watch and pencil case in his pocket and take the little scrap of paper on which so much depend as kate hand it to he she see over his shoulder that come up the lane be small pony carriage in which sit buxom lady and very small page the sleek little brown pony which draw it amble along at methodical pace which show that it be entirely master of the situation while the whole turnout have an indescribable air of comfort and good nature poor kate have be so separated from her kind that the sight of people who if not friendly be at least not hostile to she send thrill of pleasure into her heart there be something wholesome and prosaic too about this homely equipage which be inexpressibly soothe to mind so wear by successive terror "here be some one comin cry stevens clear out from here it be the governor 's order ""oh do let i stay and say one word to the lady stevens seize his great stick savagely clear out he cry in hoarse angry voice and make step towards she as if he would strike she she shrink away from he and then sudden thought seize she she turn and run through the wood as fast as her feeble strength would allow the instant that she be out of sight stevens very deliberately and carefully tear up the little slip of paper with which she have entrust he and scatter the piece to the wind kate harston flee as quickly as she could through the wood stumble over the bramble and crash through the briar regardless of pain or scratch or anything else which could stand between she and the possibility of safety she soon gain the shed and manage to mount on to the top of it by the aid of the barrel crane her neck she could see the long dusty lane with the bare withered hedge upon either side and the dreary line of the railway embankment beyond there be no pony carriage in sight she hardly expect that there would be for she have take short cut and the carriage would have to go some distance round the road along which it be travel run at right angle to the one which she be now overlook and the chance be equal as to whether the lady would turn round or go straight on in the latter case it would not be possible for she to attract her attention her heart seem to stand still with anxiety as she peer over the high wall at the spot where the two road cross presently she hear the rattle of wheel and the brown pony trot round the corner the carriage draw up at the end of the lane and the driver seem to be uncertain how to proceed then she shake the rein and the pony lumber on along the road kate give cry of despair and the last ray of hope die away from her heart it chance however that the page in the carriage be just at that happy age when the sense be keen and on the alert he hear the cry and glancing round he see through break in the hedge that lady be look over the wall which skirt the lane they have pass he mention the fact to his mistress "maybe we 'd well go back ma'am he say "maybe we 'd well not john say the buxom lady people can look over their garden wall without our interfere with they ca n't they?""yes ma'am but she be hollerin at we ""no john be she though maybe this be private road and we have no right to be on it ""she give holler as if some one be hurtin of she say john with decision "then we 'll go back say the lady and turn the pony round hence it come about that just as kate be descend with sad heart from her post of observation she be electrify to see the brown pony reappear and come trot round the curve of the lane with rapidity which be altogether foreign to that quadrupe 's usual habit indeed the girl turn so very white at the sight and her face assume such an expression of relief and delight that the lady who be approach saw at once that it be no common matter which have cause she to summon they "what be it my dear she cry pull up when she come abreast of the place her good kind heart be touch already by the pleading expression upon the girl 's sweet face "oh madam whoever you may be say kate in low rapid voice believe god have send you here this day be shut up in these ground and shall be murder unless help come ""be murder cry the lady in the pony carriage drop back in her seat and raise her hand in astonishment "it be only too true kate say try to speak concisely and clearly so as to enforce conviction but feel choke sensation about her throat as though an hysterical attack be impend my guardian have shut i up here for some week and firmly believe that he will never let i out alive oh do n't pray do n't think i mad be as sane as you be though god know what have go through have be enough to shake my reason "this last appeal of kate 's be in answer to an expression of incredulity and doubt which have pass over the face of the lady below it be successful in its object for the ring of truth with which she speak and the look of anxiety and terror upon her face be too genuine to be mistaken the lady draw her rein so as to bring the carriage as near the wall as be possible without lose sight of kate 's face "my dear she say you may safely tell i everything whatever can do to help you shall be do and where be powerless there be other who be my friend and may be of assistance scully be my name mrs. lavinia scully of london do n't cry my poor girl but tell i all about it and let we see how we can put matter right "thus encourage kate wipe away the tear which have be bring to her eye by the unwonted sound of friendly voice lean forward as far as she could and prevent herself from fall by pass her arm round great branch which shoot across the top of the shed she give in as few word as she could detailed account of all that have befall she she describe her guardian 's anxiety that she should marry his son her refusal their sudden departure from london their life at the priory the manner in which she be cut off from all human aid and the reason which make she believe that an attempt would be make upon her life in conclusion she narrate the scene which have occur that very morning when her guardian have tempt she to commit suicide the only incident which she omit from her story be that which have occur the night before for she feel that it might put too severe tax upon mrs. scully 's credulity indeed look back at it she almost persuade herself that the sight which she have see might be some phantom conjure up by her own imagination weaken as she be in mind and in body having conclude her narrative she wind up by implore her new find friend to assist she by let her friend in london know what have become of she and where she be mrs. scully listen with face which express alternately the most profound pity and the most burn indignation when kate have finish she sit silent for minute or more entirely absorb in her own thought she switch her whip up and down viciously and her usually placid countenance assume an expression so fierce that kate look down at she fear that she have give her offence when she look up at last however she smile so pleasantly that the poor girl be reassure and feel instinctively that she have really find true and effective friend at last "we must act promptly she say for we do n't know what they may be about or what their plan be for the future who do you say your friend were?""dr dimsdale of phillimore gardens kensington ""hasn't he get grow up son?""yes say kate with slight flush on her pale cheek "ah cry the good lady with very roguish smile see how the land lie of course of course why should n't it remember hear about that young man have hear about the girdlestones also african merchant they be in the city you see know all about you ""you know tom kate cry in astonishment "oh do n't let we get talk of tom say mrs. scully good humouredly when girl get on subject of that sort there be an end to everything what want now be business in the first place shall drive down to bedsworth and shall send to london ""god bless you ejaculate kate "but not to phillimore gardens hot head young man do foolish thing under such circumstance as these this be case that want careful management know gentleman in london who be just the man and who know would be only too proud to help lady in distress he be retired officer and his name be major clutterbuck major tobias clutterbuck ""oh know he very well and have hear of you too say kate with smile remember your name now in connection with his "it be mrs. scully 's turn to blush now never mind that she say can trust the major and know he will be down here at word from i shall let he have the fact and he can tell the dimsdales if he think it good good bye dear do n't be unhappy any more but remember that you have friend outside who will very quickly set all right good bye and wave her hand in encouragement the good widow wake up the pony which have fall fast asleep and rattle away down the lane in the direction from which she have come at four o'clock mr. girdlestone step into the bedsworth telegraph office and wire his short message it run thus case hopeless come on to morrow with doctor on receipt of this he know by their agreement that his son would come down bring with he the man of violence whom he have speak of at their last interview there be nothing for it now but that his ward should die if he delay long the crash might come before her money be available and then how vain all regret would be it seem to he that there be very little risk in the matter the girl have have no communication with any one even of those around she mrs. jorrocks be in her dotage rebecca taylforth be staunch and true and stevens know nothing every one on the country side have hear of the invalid young lady at the priory who would be surprised to hear that she have pass away he dare not call in any local medical man but his inventive brain have overcome the difficulty and have hit upon device by which he might defy both doctor and coroner if all go as he have plan it it be difficult to see any chance of detection in the case of poor man the fact that the girl 's money revert to he might arouse suspicion but he rightly argue that with
