be relieved to see he throw the stone over into turnip field and walk rapidly off in the opposite direction to the priory gate late in the afternoon ezra arrive at the priory from one of the passage window kate see he drive up the avenue in high dog cart there be broad shoulder red bearded man sit beside he and the ostler from theflying bullwas perch behind kate have rush to the window on hear the sound of wheel with some dim expectation that her friend have come soon than she anticipate glance however show she that the hope be vain from behind curtain she watch they alight and come into

clothe present contrast to the young merchant who be vulgarly spruce in his attire evidently he intend to pass the night at the priory since they have let the trap go back to the village she be glad that he have come for his presence would act as restraint upon the girdlestones in spite of her guardian 's amiability at breakfast she could not forget the word which he have use the morning before

come to head before her rescuer could arrive as the long afternoon steal away she become more and more impatient and expectant she have be sew in her room but she find that she could no long keep her attention on the stitch she pace nervously up and down the little apartment in the room beneath she could hear the dull muffled sound of man 's voice in long continuous monotone break only by the interposition now and again of one voice which be so deep and loud that it remind she of the growl of beast of prey this must belong to the red bearded stranger kate wonder what it could be that they be talk over so earnestly city affair no doubt or other business matter of importance she remember having once hear it remark that many of the rich man on change be eccentric and slovenly in their dress so the new comer might be more important person than he seem she have determine to remain in her room all the afternoon to avoid ezra but her restlessness be so great that she feel feverish and
