remark however know the way to the gate well enough to go there blindfold what comfort it be to know that there be no blood about that be the advantage of stick over knife ""you're correct there guv'nor burt say approvingly "will you kindly carry one end and 'll take the other 'll go first if you do n't mind because know the way good the train will pass in less than half an hour so we have not long to wait within that time every chance of detection will have go "girdlestone raise up the head of the murder girl and burt take her foot ezra walk behind as though he be in some dreadful dream he have fully recognize the necessity for the murder but he have never before realize how ghastly the detail would be already he have begin to repent that he have ever acquiesce in it then come thought of the splendid possibility of the african business which could only be save from destruction by this woman 's death how could he with his luxurious taste bear the squalor and poverty which would be his lot be the firm to fail well rope and long drop than such life as that all these consideration throng into his mind as he plod along the slippery footpath which lead through the forest to the wooden gate when tom and the major arrive at waterloo station the latter in the breathless condition describe in precede chapter they find the german wait for they with his two fellow exile the gentleman of nihilistic proclivity be somewhat tall and thin with long frock coat button almost up to his throat which show sign of give at the seam every here and there his grizzly hair fall over his collar behind and he have short bristle beard he stand with one hand stick into the front of his coat and the other upon his hip as though rehearse the position in which his statue might be some day erect in the street of his native russia when the people have their own and despotism be no more in spite of his worn attire there be something noble and strike about the man his bow when baumser introduce he to the major and tom would have grace any court in europe round his neck he have coarse string from which hang pair of double eye glass these he fix upon his aquiline nose and take good look at the gentleman whom he have come to serve bulow of kiel be small dark eyed clean shaven fellow quick and energetic in his movement have more the appearance of celt than of teuton he seem to be full of amiability and assure the major in execrable english how very happy he be to be able to do service to one who have show kindness to their esteemed colleague and persecute patriot von baumser indeed both of the man show great deference to the german and the major begin to perceive that his friend be very exalted individual in socialistic circle he like the look of the two foreigner and congratulate himself upon have their co operation in the matter on hand ill luck be in store for the expedition however on inquiry at the ticket office they find that there be no train for upwards of two hour and then it be slow one which would not land they until eight o'clock at bedsworth at this piece of information tom dimsdale fairly break down and stamp about the station rave and beseech the official to run special be the cost what it might this however could by no mean be do owe to the press of saturday traffic there be nothing for it but to wait the three foreigner go off in search of something to eat and having find convenient cookshop they disappear therein and feast royally at von baumser 's expense major tobias clutterbuck remain with the young man who resolutely refuse to leave the platform the major know of snug little corner not far off where he could have put in the time very comfortably but he could not bring himself to desert his companion even for minute have no doubt that that wait of two hour in the draughty station be mark up somewhere to the old sinner 's credit account indeed it be well that day that young dimsdale have good friend at his back his appearance be so strange and wild that the passer by turn back to have another look at he his eye be open and stare give fear inspire character to his expression he could not sit still for an instant but pace up and down and backwards and forwards under the influence of the fierce energy which consume he while the major plod along manfully at his side suggest every consideration which might cheer he up and narrate many tale true and apocryphal most of which fall upon heedless ear ezra girdlestone have four hour start of they that be the thought which rankle in tom 's heart and outweigh every other consideration he know kate 's nature so well that he be convinced that she would never have express such fear to mrs. scully unless she have very assure reason for they in fact apart from her own word what could this secrecy and seclusion mean except foul play after what he have learn about the insurance of the ship and the manner in which the eld girdlestone have induce he to cease correspond with kate he could believe anything of his partner he know also that in case of kate 's death the money revert to her guardian there be not single link missing in the chain of evidence which show that crime be in contemplation then who be that butcher like man whom ezra be take down with he tom could have tear his hair as he think of his present impotence and of his folly in lose sight of young girdlestone the major have put it on record that those two hour appear to he the long that ever he pass in his life and tom no doubt would endorse the sentiment everything must have an end however and the station clock the hand of which seem several time to have stop altogether begin at last to approach the hour at which the portsmouth train be time to depart baumser and his two friend have come back all three smoking cigarette and look the well for their visit to the cookshop the five get into first class railway carriage and wait would they never have do examine ticket and stamp luggage and go through all sort of tedious formality at last thank god come the shrill whistle of the guard the answer snort from the engine and they be fairly start upon their mission of rescue there be much to be arrange as to their plan of action tom von baumser and the major talk it over in low voice while the two socialists chat together in german and consume eternal cigarette tom be for march straight up to the priory and demand that girdlestone should deliver his ward up to they to the major and the german this seem an unwise proceeding it be to put themselves hopelessly wrong from legal point of view girdlestone have only to say as he assuredly would that the whole story be ridiculous mare 's nest and then what proof could they adduce or what excuse give for their interference however plausible their suspicion might be they be after all only suspicion which other people might not view in as grave light "what would you advise then tom ask pass his hand over his heated forehead "bedad 'll tell you the plan the old soldier answer and think i friend von baumser will agray with i understand that this place be surround by wall to which there be only one gate sure we

overtake she and she soon walk clane out of sight here we be at station how far to bedsworth guard?""next station sir ""thank the lord it be twinty to eight we be rather behind our time you always be if you be in particular hurry "it be nearly eight o'clock by the time they reach their destination the station master direct they to theflying bull where they secure the very vehicle in which kate and her guardian have be originally drive up by the time that the horse be put in it be close upon the half hour "drive as hard as you can go to the proiory i man say the major the sulky ostler make no remark but look of surprise pass over his phlegmatic countenance for year back so little have be hear of the old monastery that its very existence have be almost forget in bedsworth now whole troop of londoners be come down in succession demand to be drive there he ponder over the strange fact as he drive through the darkness but the only conclusion to which his bucolic mind could come be that it be high time to raise the fare to that particular point it be miserable night stormy and wet and bitterly cold none of the five man have thought to spare for the weather however the two foreigner have be so infect by the suppress excitement of their companion or have so identify themselves with their comrade cause that they be as eager as the other "are we near the major ask "the gate be just at the end the lane sir ""don't pull up at the gate but take we little past it ""there ai n't no way in except the gate the driver remark "do what you be order say the major sternly once again the ostler 's face betray unbounded astonishment he slew half way round in his seat and take as good look as be possible in the uncertain light at the face of his passenger it have occur to he that it be more than likely that he would have to swear to they at some future date in police court 'd know that thick un wi the red face he mutter to himself and he wi the yeller beard and the stick "they pass the stone pillar with the weather beat heraldic device and drive along by the high park wall when they have go hundred yard or so the major order the driver to pull up and they all get down the increase fare be pay without remonstrance and the ostler rattle away homeward with the intention of pull up at the county police station and lodge information as to the suspicious visitor whom he have bring down "it be loikely that they have watch at the gate say the major we must kape away from there this wall be great hoight we 'd good kape on until we find the aisi place to scale it ""i could get over it here tom say eagerly "wait bit few minute can make no difference one way or the other ould sir colin use to say that there be more battle lose by over haste than by slowness what be the high bank run along on the right here?""dat 's railway bankment say von baumser see de post and de little red light over yonder ""so it be the wall seem to i to be low here what be this dark thing hullo here be door lade into the ground ""it be lock though ""give i hoist here tom say imploringly do n't throw minute away you ca n't tell what may be go on inside at this very moment for all we know they may be plot her murder ""he have right say von baumser we shall await here until we hear from you help he my vriend shove he up!"tom catch the coping of the wall although the broken glass cut deeply into his hand with great heave he swing himself up and be soon astride upon the top "here be the whistle say the major stand on tiptoe to reach downstretche hand if you want we give good blow at it we 'll be with you in brace of shake if we ca n't get over the wall we 'll have the door down divil fear but we 'll be there!"tom be in the act of let himself drop into the wood when suddenly the watcher below see he crouch down upon the wall and lie motionless as though listen intently "hush he whisper lean over some one be come through the wood "the wind have die away and the storm subside even from the lane they could hear the sound of foot and of muffled voice inside the ground they all crouch down in the shadow of the wall tom lie flat upon the glass stud coping and no one look from below could distinguish he from the wall itself the voice and the footstep sound louder and louder until they be just at the other side of the boundary they seem to come from several people walk slowly and heavily there be the shrill rasp of key and the wooden door swing back on its rusty hinge while three dark figure pass out who appear to bear some burden between they the party in the shadow crouch close still and peer through the darkness with eager anxious eye they could discern little save the vague outline of the move man and yet as they gaze at they an unaccountable and overpower horror creep into the heart of every one of they they breathe the atmosphere of death the new comer tramp across the road and push through the thin hedge ascend the railway embankment upon the other side it be evident that their burden be heavy one for they stop more than once while ascend the steep grassy slope and once when near the top one of the party slip and there be sound as though he have fall upon his knee together with stifled oath they reach the top however and their figure which have disappear from view come into sight again stand out dimly against the murky sky they bend down over the railway line and place the indistinguishable mass which they bear carefully upon it "we must have the light say voice "no no there be no need another expostulate "we ca n't work in the dark say third loudly and harshly "where be your lantern guv'nor 've get lucifer ""we must manage that the train pass over right the first voice remark here burt you light it?"there be the sharp sound of the striking of match and feeble glimmer appear in the darkness it flicker and wane as though the wind would extinguish it but next instant the wick of the lantern have catch and throw strong yellow glare upon the scene the light fall upon the major and his comrade who have spring into the road and it light up the group on the railway line yet it be not upon the rescue party that the murderer fix their terror stricken eye and the major and his friend have lose all thought of the miscreant above they for there stand in the centre of the roadway there with the light flicker over her pale sweet face like spirit from the tomb stand none other than the much endure cruelly treat girl for whom burt 's murderous blow have be intend for few moment she stand there without either party move foot or utter sound then there come from the railway line cry so wild that it will ring for ever in the ear of those who hear it burt drop upon his knee and put his band over his eye to keep out the sight john girdlestone catch his son by the wrist and dash away into the darkness fly wildly madly with white face and stare eye as man who have look upon that which be not of this world in the meantime tom have spring down from his perch and have clasp kate in his arm and there she lie sob and laugh with many pretty feminine ejaculation and exclamation and question save at last from the net of death which have be close upon she so long if ever two man be completely cow and break down those two be the african merchant and his son wet tear and soil they still struggle on in their aimless flight crash through hedge and clamber over obstacle with the one idea in their frenzied mind of leave mile between they and that fair accuse face exhausted and pant they still battle through the darkness and the storm until they see the gleam of the surge and hear the crash of the great wave upon the beach then they stop amid the sand and the shingle the moon be shine down now in all its calm splendour illuminate the great tossing ocean and the long dark sweep of the hampshire coast by its light the two man look at one another such look as two lose soul might have exchange when they hear the gate of hell first clang behind they who could have recognize they now as the respected trader of fenchurch street and his fastidious son their clothe be tattere their face splash with mud and scar by bramble and thorn the elder man have lose his hat and his silvery hair blow out in confused tangle behind he even more noticeable however than the change in their attire be the alteration in their expression both have the same startled furtive look of apprehension like beast of prey who hear the baying of the hound in the distance their quiver hand and gasp breath betray their exhaustion yet they glance around they nervously as though the least sound would send they off once more upon their wild career "you devil ezra cry at last in harsh choke voice take step towards his father with gesture as though he would have strike he you have bring we to this with your canting and scheme and plot what be we to do now eh answer i that he catch the old man by the coat and shake he violently girdlestone 's face be all draw as though he be threaten with fit and his eye be glassy and vacant the moonlight glitter in they and play over his contorted feature do you see she he whisper with tremble lip do you see her?""yes see she the other answer brusquely and see that infernal fellow from london and the major and god know how many more behind she nice hornet nest to bring about one 's ear ""it be her spirit say his father in the same awe strike voice "the spirit of john harston 's murder daughter ""it be the girl herself say ezra he have be panic stricken at the moment but have have time during their flight to realize the situation we have make pretty botch of the whole thing ""the girl herself cry girdlestone in bewilderment for heaven 's sake do n't mock i who be it that we carry through the wood and lay upon the rails?""who be it why that jealous jade rebecca taylforth of course who must have read my note and come out in the other 's cloak and hat to hear what have to say to she the cursed fool!""the wrong woman girdlestone mutter with the same vacant look upon his face all for nothing then for nothing!""don't stand mumbling to yourself there cry ezra catch his father 's arm and half drag he along the beach do n't you understand that there be hue and cry out after you and that we 'll be hang if we be take wake up and exert yourself the gallow would be nice end to all your preaching and pray would n't it?"they hurry along together down the beach plough their way through the loose shingle and trip over the great mat of seaweed which have be cast up in the recent gale the wind be still so great that they have to lower their head and to put their shoulder against it while the salt spray cause their eye to smart and tingle on their lip "where be you take i my son ask the old man once "to the only chance we have of safety come on and ask no question "through the murkiness of the night they see single light flicker dimly ahead of they this be evidently the goal at which ezra be aim as they toil on it grow large and bright until it resolve itself into the glare of lamp shine through small diamond pan window girdlestone recognize the place now it be the hut of fisherman name sampson who live mile or more from claxton he remember have his attention attract to the place by the curious nature of the building which be construct out of the remnant of norwegian barque strand some year before the thatch which cover it and the window and door cut in the side give it curiously hybrid appearance and make it an object of interest to sightseer in those part sampson be the owner of fair sized fishing boat which he work with his eld son and which be say to yield he decent livelihood "what be you go to do ask girdlestone as his son make his way to the door "don't look like ghost ezra answer in an angry whisper "we're all safe if we be only cool ""i be well now you can trust i ""keep smile face then say ezra and knock loudly at the door of the hut the occupant have not hear their approach owe to the storm but the instant that the young merchant strike the door there be buzz of conversation and the sharp barking of dog then come dull thud and the barking cease from which ezra conclude that some one have hurl boot at the animal "we hain't no bait cry gruff voice "can see mr. sampson ask ezra "i tell ee we hain't no bait roar the voice in more irritable tone "we do n't want bait we want word of talk say ezra as he speak the door fly open and burly middle aged man in red shirt appear with face which be almost the same colour as his garment we hain't get no he be begin when he suddenly recognize his visitor and break short off stare at they with as much surprise as it be possible for human feature to express "well if it ai n't
