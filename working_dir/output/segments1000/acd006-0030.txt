horizon and lie in great shadow over the coast on all other point the sky be clear save that here and there single puff of white vapour sail along like the feather of some gigantic bird float in the ocean of air these isolated cloud which have be pearly grey in the dim light of early day gradually take lilac tint which deepen into pink and then blush suddenly to fiery scarlet as the red rim of the sun rise majestically over the horizon all the heaven be fill with colour from the pale lightest blue at the zenith to the most brilliant crimson in the east as though it be nature 's palette on which she have dash every tint that she possess the sea reflect the rich glow and the tossing wave be gash with scarlet streak it look like sea of blood the merchant remark with shudder as he gaze at the wonderful spectacle by the return light the two fugitive be able to notice each other 's appearance both be pale haggard dishevel with bloodshot dark rim eye and anxious weary face "this wo n't do remark ezra if miggs see we like this he 'll smell rat "he dip bucket overboard and after some search small piece of soap and broken comb be extract from one of the locker with these material they manage to perform their toilet they re arrange and clean each other 's clothing too and ezra purchase yachting cap from sampson for his father the jaunty nature of which contrast strangely with the old man 's grim angular visage "there be fine view sampson observe point towards the land just as his two passenger have finish their toilet they be pass high range of cliff which run along for great distance some be of chalk and other be brownish as though consist of some sort of earth there be one which terminate the line tower up above the rest and as remarkable for the boldness of its outline as for its height lighthouse stand upon the summit and the whole show up so clearly in the bright morning air that the fugitive could see the green grass round the house and the coastguardsman at the signal station who be stroll leisurely about and look down from his elevation at their little craft to the eastward of this chalk promontory be large fine look town which stretch in wide semicircle round the shore of curve bay "that 's beachy head say sampson point at the cliff it be the hoiest p'int down channel and they have look out place up there to report ship as pass it be muster lloyd as

tiller the two fugitive have their breakfast but as it consist of nothing more appetising than tin corn beef and ship biscuit and as neither of they have much inclination for food it be not very lengthy meal then they sit in the sheet once more watch the grand panorama of green woodland and swell down and tower cliff which pass before they on the one side while on the other the great ocean highway be dot with every variety of vessel from the portland ketch or the sunderland brig with its cargo of coal to the majestic four masted liner which sweep past with the green wave swirl round her forefoot and break away into fork of eddy water in her wake ezra caution his father to sit down for he observe row of curious face gaze at they over the quarter of one great vessel "our dress be n't quite what you would expect to see in fishing boat he say there be no use set tongue wag there be still fresh breeze and the little boat continue to fly before it at the rate of six or eight knot this wind be lucky chance ezra remark rather to himself than to his companion "it be the working of providence answer john girdlestone with an earnestness which show that his mind still retain its habitual peculiarity by ten o'clock they be abreast of the long stone terrace of hastings at half past eleven they see the mast of the fishing smack of winchelsea by one they be round the sharp bold promontory of dungeness they keep far to sea after that so that the long white wall and the spire of folkestone and of dover lie far on the horizon on the other side dim haze upon the blue water mark the position of the french coast it be nearly five and the sun be begin to sink down again in the west when the fisherman after gaze steadily ahead for some time with his horny hand shade his eye touch ezra on the sleeve "see they breaker over there he say point over the starboard bow far away ezra could see long roll of foam break the monotony of the broad stretch of ocean they be the goodwins he go on and they craft ahead be at anchor in the downs "the vessel in question be mile away but ezra brighten up at the sight of their destination and he once again arrange his toilet and that of his father "thank goodness he mutter with long sigh of relief as he peer at the ship which be grow clear and large every moment that outer one be theblack eagle or be much mistaken he be not go yet!""that be theblack eagle his father say with confidence know she by the cut of her stern and the rake of her mast "as they come near still any linger doubt be finally dispel "there be the white paint line say ezra it be certainly she take we alongside that ship which be lie to the outside there sampson "the fisherman look ahead once more to the barque which have just get her anchor up he say why we wo n't be in time to catch she ""her anchor up scream ezra you do n't mean to tell i she be off!""look at that the man answer as he speak they see first one great square of canvas appear above the vessel and then another until she have spread her white wing to their full extent "don't say we ca n't catch she cry ezra with furious oath "i tell you man that we must catch she everything depend on that ""she must take three short tack before she be out from the goodwins if we run right on as we be go we may get near she before she be free ""for god 's sake clap on all the sail you can get these reef out with tremble finger ezra let out the sail and the boat lie over far under the increase pressure be there no other sail that we could put up?""if we be run we could rig up spinnaker the fisherman answer but the wind have come round three point we can do no more ""i think we be catch she john girdlestone cry keep his eye fix upon the barque which be about mile and half ahead "yes we be now but she hain't get her way on yet she 'll draw ahead presently wo n't she jarge?"the fisherman 's son nod and burst into hoarse merriment "it 's better'n race he cry "with our neck for prize ezra mutter to himself "it be little too exciting to be pleasant we be still gain "they have clear view of the dark hull and tower canvas of the barque as she sweep along in front of they intend evidently to take advantage of the wind in order to get outside the goodwins before beat up channel "she be go about sampson remark as he speak the snow white pile lie over in the opposite direction and the whole broadside of the vessel become visible to they every sail stand out as though carve from ivory against the cold blue sky if we do n't catch she on this tack we wo n't get she at all the fisherman observe when they put about next they 'll reach right out into the channel ""where 's something white say ezra excitedly he dive into the cabin and reappear with dirty table cloth stand up here father now keep on wave it they may see you ""i think as we be overhaulin of they remark the boy "we're do that his father answer the question be will we get near enough to stop 'em afore they get off on the next tack?"the old merchant be stand in the bow wave the signal in the air his son spring up beside he and flourish his handkerchief they do n't look more than half mile off let we shout together the two blend their voice in hoarse roar which be take up by the boatman and his son once again cry ezra and again their shout resound over the sea long draw cry it be with ring of despair and of sorrow still the barque keep steadily on her way "if they do n't go about we shall catch they the fisherman say "if they keep on another five minute we be right ""do you hear that ezra cry to his father and they both shout with new energy and wave their signal "they're goin' about george burst in it be all up girdlestone groan as he see the mainyard swing back they all strain their eye wait for the other to follow it remain stationary "they have see we cry the fisherman they be waitin to pick we up!""then we be save say ezra step down and wipe the perspiration which pour from his forehead go down into the cabin father and put yourself straight you look like ghost "captain hamilton miggs have find the liquor of thecock and cowslipso very much to his taste in spite of its vitriolic peculiarity record in precede chapter that he rejoin his ship in very shaky and demoralize condition he be devout believer in the homoeopathic revelation that like may be cure by like so he forthwith proceed to set himself straight by the consumption of an unlimited quantity of ship 's rum what be the good of have pilot aboard if be to keep sober he hiccough to his mate mcpherson after which piece of logic he shut himself up in his cabin and roar comic song all the way from london to gravesend he be so exhausted by his performance that he fall fast asleep and snore stertorously for fifteen hour at the end of which time he come on deck and find that theblack eaglewas lie off deal and that her anchor be just be hoist for start up channel captain hamilton miggs watch the sail setting with his hand in his pocket and swear promiscuously at every one from the mate downward in hearty comprehensive way which show mind that be superior to petty distinction having run over all the oath that he could think of he dive below and help himself from the rum bottle process which appear to aid his memory or his invention for he reappear upon deck and evolve new many joint expletive at the man at the wheel he then stride in gloomy majesty up and down the quarter deck cast his eye at the sail and at the cloud in critical way calculate to impress the crew generally with sense of their captain 's extraordinary sagacity theblank eaglehad go about for the second time and be just about to free herself from the goodwins and reach out into the channel when miggs eye happen to fall upon the fishing boat in pursuit and the white flutter in her bow he examine she with his glass steady it as well as he could by lean it across the rail as his hand be very shaky after short inspection look of astonishment follow by one of resignation steal over his feature "i've get they again mac he remark to the mate "got what sir?""the diddleum the jump the vision it be the change of air as have do it ""you look all right remark the mate in sympathetic voice "so may but 've get 'em it be usually rat rat and sometimes cockroache but it be bad than that this time as be livin man look through the glass at that fishing boat astern of we and see young muster ezra girdlestone in it and the old boss standin up wi yachtin'-cap at the side of his head and wave towel this be the smart bout that ever have have 'll take some of the medicine leave from my last touch and 'll turn in he vanish down the companion and having take strong dose of bromide of potassium tumble into his bunk curse loudly at his ill luck the astonishment of mcpherson upon deck be as great as that of captain miggs when on look through the glass he ascertain beyond all doubt that both of his employer be in the fishing boat he at once order the mainyard to be haul back and await their arrival in few minute the boat be alongside ladder throw down and the two girdlestones be on the deck of their own ship "where be the captain ask the head of the firm "he be below sir he be no very salubrious the mate 's love of long word rise superior to any personal emotion "you can square the yard say ezra we be go with you ""ay ay sir square away that yard there it swing round into position and theblack eagleresume her voyage "there be some business to be look after in spain girdlestone remark to mcpherson it come up suddenly or we should have give you notice it be absolutely necessary that we should be there personally it be more convenient to go in our own vessel than to wait for passenger ship ""where will you sleep sir ask the mate doubt the accommodation be no very munificent ""there be two settee in the cabin we can do on they very well think we ca n't do well than go down there at once for we have have long and tiring journey "after they have disappear into the cabin mcpherson trod the deck for the remainder of his watch with grave and thoughtful face like most of his countryman he be shrewd and long headed it strike he that it be very strange thing for the two partner to be absent at the same time from their business again where be their luggage grave misgiving arise in his mind as to the reason of it all he keep they to himself however and content himself with remark to the carpenter that in all his experience he have never meet with more monumentous episode "the early part of the voyage of theblack eaglewas extremely fortunate the wind come round to the eastward and waft they steadily down channel until on the third day they see the isle of ushant lie low upon the sky line no inquisitive gunboat or lurk police launch come within sight of they though whenever any vessel 's course bring she in their direction the heart of ezra girdlestone sink within he on one occasion small brig signal to they and the wretched fugitive when they see the flag run up think that all be lose it prove however to be merely some trivial message and the two owner breathe again the wind fall away on the day that they clear

eaglelay roll about as though she have learn habit of inebriation from her skipper the sky be very clear above but all round the horizon low haze lie upon the water so silent be it that the creaking of the boat as they swing at the davit and the straining of the shrouds as the ship roll sound loud and clear as do the raucous cry of couple of gull which hover round the poop every now and then rumble noise end in thud down below show that the swing of the ship have cause something to come down with run underlie all other sound however be muffled clank clank which might almost make one forget that this be sailing ship it sound so like the chipping of propeller "what be that noise captain miggs ask john girdlestone as he stood lean over the quarter rail while the old sea dog sextant

pump goin' migg answer pack his sextant away in its case "the pump think they be only use when ship be in danger?"ezra come along the deck at this moment and listen with interest to the conversation
