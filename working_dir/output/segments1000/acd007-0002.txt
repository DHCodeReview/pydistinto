morning and the air be heavy with the smell of the fresh turn earth gabriel be wait for i under the hawthorn tree outside the gap and we stand hand in hand look down at the long sweep of moorland and at the broad blue channel which encircle it with its fringe of foam far away in the north west the sun glint upon the high peak of mount throston from where we stand we could see the smoke of the steamer as they plough along the busy water way which lead to belfast "is it not magnificent gabriel cry clasp her hand round my arm ah john why be we not free to sail away over these wave together

"for heaven 's sake john she cry earnestly do nothing of the kind he would whip we all away in the dead of the night and within week we should be settle down again in some wilderness where we might never have chance of see or hear from you again besides he never would forgive we for venture out of the ground ""i do n't think that he be hard hearted man remark have see kindly look in his eye for

""would my father 's monomania account for the fact of my brother 's hair turn grey and my mother waste away to mere shadow?""undoubtedly answer the long continue worry of the general 's restlessness and irritability would produce those effect on sensitive nature ""no no say she shake her head sadly have be expose to his restlessness and irritability but they have have no such effect upon i the

feature of which be distort by the most malignant hatred and anger find himself observe he step out and advanced towards we when see that it be none other than the general himself his beard be all bristle with fury and his deepset eye glow from under their heavily vein lid with most sinister and demoniacal brightness "to your room girl he cry in hoarse harsh voice step in between we and point

have expect the general give long whistle of astonishment and then leant up against the railing laugh softly to himself "english terrier be fond of nose worm he remark at last when we bring they out to india they use to trot off into the jungle and begin sniff at what they imagine to be worm there but the worm turn out to be venomous snake and so poor doggy play no more think you 'll find

the happiness of both of we be at stake it be in your power to divide our body but our soul shall be for ever united ""my good fellow say the general in not unkindly tone you do n't know what you be ask for there be gulf between you and any one of the blood of heatherstone which can never be bridge over "all trace of anger have vanish now from his manner and give place to an air of somewhat contemptuous amusement my family pride take fire at his word the gulf may be less than you imagine say coldly we be not clodhopper because we live in this out of the way place be of noble descent on one side and my mother be buchan of buchan assure you that there be no such disparity between we as you seem to imagine ""you misunderstand i the general answer it be on our side that the disparity lie there be reason why my daughter gabriel should live and die single it would not be to your advantage to marry she ""but surely sir persist be the good judge of my own interest and advantage since you take this ground all become easy for do assure you that the one interest which override all other be that should have the woman love for my wife if this be your only objection to our match you may surely give we your consent for any danger or trial which may incur in marry gabriel will not weigh with i one featherweight ""here be young bantam exclaim the old soldier smile at my warmth it be easy to defy danger when you do n't know what the danger be ""what be it then ask hotly there be no earthly peril which will drive i from gabriel 's side let i know what it be and test i ""no no that would never do he answer with sigh and then thoughtfully as if speak his mind aloud he have plenty of pluck and be well grow lad too we might do bad than make use of he "he go on mumble to himself with vacant stare in his eye as if he have forget my presence "look here west he say presently you 'll excuse i if speak hastily little time ago it be the second time that have have occasion to apologise to you for the same offence it sha n't occur again be rather over particular no doubt in my desire for complete isolation but have good reason for insist on the point rightly or wrongly have get it into my head that some day there might be an organise raid upon my ground if anything of the sort should occur suppose might reckon upon your assistance?""with all my heart ""so that if ever you get message such as come up or even cloomber you would know that it be an appeal for help and would hurry up immediately even if it be in the dead of the night?""most certainly should answer but might ask you what the nature of the danger be which you apprehend?""there would be nothing gain by your knowing indeed you would hardly understand it if tell you must bid you good day now for have stay with you too long remember count upon you as one of the cloomber garrison now ""one other thing sir say hurriedly for he be turn away hope that you will not be angry with your daughter for anything which have tell you it be for my sake that she keep it all secret from you ""all right he say with his cold inscrutable smile be not such an ogre in the bosom of my family as you seem to think as to this marriage question should advise you as friend to let it drop altogether but if that be impossible must insist that it stand over completely for the present it be impossible to say what unexpected turn event may take good bye "he plunge into the wood and be quickly out of sight among the dense plantation thus end this extraordinary interview in which this strange man have begin by point loaded pistol at my breast and have end by partially acknowledge the possibility of my become his future son in law hardly know whether to be cast down or elate over it on the one hand he be likely by keep close watch over his daughter to prevent we from communicate as freely as we have do hitherto against this there be the advantage of having obtain an imply consent to the renewal of my suit at some future date on the whole come to the conclusion as walk thoughtfully home that have improve my position by the incident but this danger this shadowy unspeakable danger which appear to rise up at every turn and to hang day and night over the tower of cloomber rack my brain as would could not conjure up any solution to the problem which be not puerile and inadequate one fact strike i as be significant both the father and the son have assure i independently of each other that if be tell what the peril be would hardly realise its significance how strange and bizarre must the fear be which can scarcely be express in intelligible language!i hold up my hand in the darkness before turn to sleep that night and swear that no power of man or devil should ever weaken my love for the woman whose pure heart have have the good fortune to win in make this statement have purposely couch it in bald and simple language for fear should be accuse of colour my narrative for the sake of effect if however have tell my story with any approach to realism the reader will understand i when say that by this time the succession of dramatic incident which have occur have arrest my attention and excite my imagination to the exclusion of all minor topic how could plod through the dull routine of an agent 's work or interest myself in the thatch of this tenant 's bothy or the sail of that one 's boat when my mind be take up by the chain of event which have describe and be still busy seek an explanation for they go where would over the countryside could see the square white tower shoot out from among the tree and beneath that tower this ill fate family be watch and wait wait and watch and for what that be still the question which stand like an impassable barrier at the end of every train of thought regard merely as an abstract problem this mystery of the heatherstone family have lurid fascination about it but when the woman whom love thousandfold well than do myself prove to be so deeply interested in the solution feel that it be impossible to turn my thought to anything else until it have be finally clear up my good father have receive letter from the laird date from naples which tell we that he have derive much benefit from the change and that he have no intention of return to scotland for some time this be satisfactory to all of we for my father have find branksome such an excellent place for study that it would have be sore trial to he to return to the noise and tumult of city as to my dear sister and myself there be as have show strong reason still to make we love the wigtownshire moor in spite of my interview with the general or perhaps might say on account of it take occasion at least twice day to walk towards cloomber and satisfy myself that all be well there he have begin by resent my intrusion but he have end by take i into sort of half confidence and even by ask my assistance so feel that stand upon different footing with he than have do formerly and that he be less likely to be annoy by my presence indeed meet he pace round the inclosure few day afterwards and his manner towards i be civil though he make no allusion to our former conversation he appear to be still in an extreme state of nervousness start from time to time and gaze furtively about he with little frightened dart glance to the right and the left hope that his daughter be right in name the fifth of october as the turning point of his complaint for it be evident to i as look at his gleam eye and quiver hand that man could not live long in such state of nervous tension find on examination that he have have the loose rail securely fasten so as to block up our former trysting place and though prowl round the whole long line of fencing be unable to find any other place where an entrance could be effect here and there between the few chink leave in the barrier could catch glimpse of the hall and once see rough look middle aged man stand at window on the low floor whom suppose to be israel stakes the coachman there be no sign however of gabriel or of mordaunt and their absence alarm i be convinced that unless they be under some restraint they would have manage to communicate with my sister or myself my fear become more and more acute as day follow day without our seeing or hear anything of they one morning it be the second day of october be walk towards the hall hope that might be fortunate enough to learn some news of my darling when observe man perch upon stone at the side of the road as come near to he could see that he be stranger and from his dusty clothe and dilapidated appearance he seem to have come from distance he have great hunch of bread on his knee and clasp knife in his hand but he have apparently just finish his breakfast for he brush the crumb off his lap and rise to his foot when he perceive i notice the great height of the fellow and that he still hold his weapon keep well to the other side of the road for know that destitution make man desperate and that the chain that glitter on my waistcoat might be too great temptation to he upon this lonely highway be confirm in my fear when see he step out into the centre of the road and bar my progress "well my lad say affect an ease which by no mean feel what can do for you this morning?"the fellow 's face be the colour of mahogany with exposure to the weather and he have deep scar from the corner of his mouth to his ear which by no mean improve his appearance his hair be grizzle but his figure be stalwart and his fur cap be cock on one side so as to give he rakish semi military appearance altogether he give i the impression of be one of the most dangerous type of tramp that have ever fall in with instead of reply to my question he eye i for some time in silence with sullen yellow shot eye and then close his knife with loud snick "you're not beak he say too young for that guess they have i in chokey at paisley and they have i in chokey at wigtown but by the living thunder if another of they lay hand on i 'll make he remember corporal rufus smith it be darn fine country this where they wo n't give man work and then lay he by the heel for have no visible mean of
