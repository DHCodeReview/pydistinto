it be weel tae be ready for whatever may come i and you and my son mordaunt and mr. fothergill west of branksome who would come if he be require ought tae be able tae show bauld face what think ye?""'deed sir say feastin be aye well than fechtin but if ye'll raise i pund month 'll no shirk my share either ""we wo n't quarrel ower that say he and agree tae the extra twal pund year as easy as though it be as many bawbee far be it frae i tae think evil but couldna help surmisin at the time that money that be so lightly pairte wi be maybe no so very honestly cam by i'm no curious or pryin mun by nature but be sair puzzle in my ain mind tae tell why it be that the general walk aboot at nicht and what keep he frae his sleep weel ane day be cleanin doon the passage when my e'e fall on great muckle heap curtain and auld cairpet and sic like thing that be pile away in corner no vera far frae the door the general 's room sudden thocht come intae my heid and say tae mysel':"israel laddie say what be tae stop ye frae hidin behind that this vera nicht and seein the auld mun when he doesna ken human e'e be on him?"the mair thocht o't the mair seemple it appear and make up my mind tae put the idea intae instant execution when the nicht cam roond tauld the woman folk that be bad wi the jawache and would gang airly tae my room ken fine when ance get there that there be na chance ony ane disturbin i so wait wee while and then when be quiet slippit aff my boot and run doon the ither stair until cam tae the heap auld clothe and there lie doon wi ane e'e peepin through kink and the rest cover up wi great ragged cairpet there bide as quiet as mouse until the general pass i on his road tae bed and be still in the hoose my certie wouldna gang through wi it again for the siller at the union bank of dumfries canna think o't noo withoot feelin cauld the way doon my back it be just awfu lyin there in the deid silence waitin and waitin wi never soond tae break the monotony except the heavy tickin an auld clock somewhere doon the passage first would look doon the corridor in the one way and syne 'd look doon in t'ither but it aye seem to i as though there be something come up frae the side that wasna lookin at have cauld sweat on my broo and my hairt be beatin twice tae ilka tick the clock and what fear i most of be that the dust frae the curtain and thing be aye gettin doon intae my lung and it be could dae tae keep mysel frae coughin' godsake wonder my hair wasna grey wi that go through wouldna dae it again to be make lord provost glasgie weel it may have be twa o'clock in the mornin or maybe little mair and be just thinkin that wasna tae see onything after and wasna very sorry neither when all sudden soond cam tae my ear clear and distinct through the stillness the nicht i've be ask afore noo tae describe that soond but 've aye foond that it be no vera easy tae gie clear idea o't though it be unlike any other soond that ever hearken tae it be shairp ringin clang like what could be cause by flippin the rim wineglass but it be far high and thin than that and have in it tae kind splash like the tinkle rain drop intae water butt in my fear sit up amang my cairpet like puddock among gowan leave and listen wi my ear be still again noo except for the dull tickin the distant clock suddenly the soond cam again as clear as shrill as shairp as ever and this time the general hear it for hear he gie kind groan as tired man might wha have be roose oot his sleep he get up frae his bed and could make oot rustling noise as though he be dressin himsel and presently his footfa as he begin tae walk up and doon in his room mysake it didna tak lang for i tae drap doon amang the cairpet again and cover mysel ower there lie tremblin in every limb and sayin as mony prayer as could mind wi my e'e still peepin through the keek hole and fix upon the door the general 's room hear the rattle the handle presently and the door swing slowly open there be licht burnin in the room beyond an could just catch glimpse what seem tae i like row sword stick alang the side the wa when the general step oot and shut the door behind he he be dress in dressin goon wi red smokin'-cap on his heid and pair slipper wi the heel cut off and the taes turn up for moment it cam into my hold that maybe he be walkin in his sleep but as he cam towards i could see the glint the licht in his e'en and his face be twistin like man that be in sair distress mind on my conscience it gi i the shake noo when think his tall figure and his yelley face comin sae solemn and silent doon the lang lone passage haud my breath and lie close watchin he but just as he cam tae where be my vera hairt stand still in my breast for te loud and clear within yaird i cam the ringin clangin soond that have a'ready hairkene tae where it cam frae be mair than can tell or what be the cause o't it might ha be that the general make it but be sair puzzled tae tell hoo for his hond be baith doon by his side as he pass i it cam frae his direction certainly but it appear tae i tae come frae ower his heid but it be siccan thin eerie high pitch uncanny kind soond that it wasna easy tae say just exactly where it do come frae the general tuk nae hee o't but walk on and be soon oot sicht and didna lose minute in creepin oot frae my hidin place and scamperin awa back tae my room and if the bogie in the red sea be trapesin up and doon the hale nicht through wud never put my heid oot again tae hae glimpse they didna say word tae anybody aboot what have see but make up my mind that wudna stay muckle langer at cloomber ha four pund month be good wage but it isna enough tae pay man for the loss his peace mind and maybe the loss his soul as weel for when the deil be aboot ye canna tell what sort trap he may lay for ye and though they say that providence be strong than he it be maybe as weel no to risk it it be clear tae i that the general and his hoose be baith under some curse and it be fit that that curse should fa on they that have earn it and no on righteous presbyterian wha have ever trod the narrow path my hairt be sair for young miss gabriel for she be bonnie and winsome lassie but for that feel that my duty be tae mysel and that should gang forth even as lot gang oot the wicked city the plain that awfu cling clang be aye dingin in my lug and couldna bear to be alane in the passage for fear hearin it ance again only want chance or an excuse tae gie the general notice and tae gang back to some place where could see christian folk and have the kirk within

from dr. easterling now practise at stranraer it be true that the doctor be only once within the wall of cloomber during its tenancy by general heatherstone but there be some circumstance connect with this visit which make it valuable especially when consider as supplement to the experience which have just submit to the reader the doctor have find time amid the call of busy country practice to jot down his recollection and feel that can not do well than subjoin they exactly as they stand have very much pleasure in furnish mr. fothergill west with an account of my solitary visit to cloomber hall not only on account of the esteem which have form for that gentleman ever since his residence at branksome but also because it be my conviction that the fact in the case of general heatherstone be of such singular nature that it be of the high importance that they should be place before the public in trustworthy manner it be about the beginning of september of last year that receive note from mrs. heatherstone of cloomber hall desire i to make professional call upon her husband whose health she say have be for some time in very unsatisfactory state have hear something of the heatherstones and of the strange seclusion in which they live so that be very much pleased at this opportunity of make their close acquaintance and lose no time in comply with her request have know the hall in the old day of mr. mcvittie the original proprietor and be astonish on arrive at the avenue gate to observe the change which have take place the gate itself which use to yawn so hospitably upon the road be now bar and lock and high wooden fence with nail upon the top encircle the whole ground the drive itself be leaf strew and uncared for and the whole place have depressing air of neglect and decay have to knock twice before servant maid open the door and show i through dingy hall into small room where sit an elderly careworn lady who introduce herself as mrs. heatherstone with her pale face her grey hair her sad colourless eye and her fade silk dress she be in perfect keeping with her melancholy surrounding "you find we in much trouble doctor she say in quiet refined voice my poor husband have have great deal to worry he and his nervous system for long time have be in very weak state we come to this part of the country in the hope that the brace air and the quiet would have good effect upon

outline which be cover over with sheet of linen all round the wall and in the corner be arrange very choice and varied collection of arm principally sword some of which be of the straight pattern in common use in the british army while among the other be scimitar tulwar cuchurrie and score of other specimen of oriental workmanship many of these be richly mount with inlay sheath and hilt sparkle with precious stone so that there be piquant contrast between the simplicity of the apartment and the wealth which glitter on the wall have little time however to observe the general 's collection since the general himself lie upon the couch and be evidently in sore need of my service he be lie with his head turn half away from we breathe heavily and apparently unconscious of our presence his bright stare eye and the deep hectic flush upon his cheek show that his fever be at its height advance to the bedside and stoop over he place my finger upon his pulse when immediately he spring up into the sit position and strike at i frenziedly with his clenched hand have never see such intensity of fear and horror stamp upon human face as appear upon that which be now glare up at i "bloodhound he yell let i go let i go say keep your hand off i be it not enough that my life have be ruin when be it all to end how long be to endure it?""hush dear hush say his wife in soothe voice pass her cool hand over his heated forehead this be doctor easterling from stranraer he have not come to harm you but to do you good "the general drop wearily back upon his pillow and could see by the change expression of his face that his delirium have leave he and that he understand what have be say slip my clinical thermometer into his armpit and count his pulse rate it amount to 120 per minute and his temperature prove to be 104 degree clearly it be case of remittent fever such as occur in man who have spend great part of their life in the tropic "there be no danger remark with little quinine and arsenic we shall very soon overcome the attack and restore his health ""no danger eh he say there never be any danger for i be as hard to kill as the wandering jew be quite clear in the head now mary so you may leave i with the doctor "mrs heatherstone leave the room rather unwillingly as think and sit down by the bedside to listen to anything which my patient might have to communicate "i want you to examine my liver he say when the door be closed use to have an abscess there and brodie the staff surgeon say that it be ten to one that it would carry i off have not feel much of it since leave the east this be where it use to be just under the angle of the rib ""i can find the place say after make careful examination but be happy to tell you that the abscess have either be entirely absorb or have turn calcareous as these solitary abscess will there be no fear of its do you any harm now "he seem to be by no mean overjoy at the intelligence "thing always happen so with i he say moodily now if another fellow be feverish and delirious he would surely be in some danger and yet you will tell i that be in none look at this now he bare his chest and show i pucker wound over the region of the heart that be where the jezail bullet of hillman go in you would think that be in the right spot to settle man and yet what do it do but glance upon rib and go clean round and out at the back without so much as penetrate what you medico call the pleura do ever you hear of such thing?""you be certainly bear under lucky star observe with smile "that be matter of opinion he answer shake his head death have no terror for i if it will but come in some familiar form but confess that the anticipation of some strange some preternatural form of death be very terrible and unnerving ""you mean say rather puzzle at his remark that you would prefer natural death to death by violence?""no do n't mean that exactly he answer be too familiar with cold steel and lead to be afraid of either do you know anything about odyllic force doctor?""no do not reply glance sharply at he to see if there be any sign of his delirium return his expression be intelligent however and the feverish flush have fade from his cheek "ah you western scientific man be very much behind the day in some thing he remark in all that be material and conducive to the comfort of the body you be pre eminent but in what concern the subtle force of nature and the latent power of the human spirit your good man be century behind the humblest coolie of india countless generation of beef eating comfort love ancestor have give our animal instinct the command over our spiritual one the body which should have be mere tool for the use of the soul have now become degrading prison in which it be confine the oriental soul and body be not so weld together as our be and there be far less wrench when they part in death ""they do not appear to derive much benefit from this peculiarity in their organisation remark incredulously "merely the benefit of superior knowledge the general answer if you be to go to india probably the very first thing you would see in the way of amusement would be native do what be call the mango trick of course you have hear or read of it the fellow plant mango seed and make pass over it until it sprout and bear leave and fruit all in the space of half an hour it be not really trick it be power these man know more than your tyndalls or huxleys do about nature 's process and they can accelerate or retard her working by subtle mean of which we have no conception these low caste conjurer as they be call be mere vulgar dabbler but the man who have trod the high path be as far superior to we in knowledge as we be to the hottentots or patagonians ""you speak as if you be well acquaint with they remark "to my cost be he answer have be bring in contact with they in way in which trust no other poor chap ever will be but really as regard odyllic force

magnetism these supplement by the twenty seven aphorism of mesmer and the work of dr. justinus kerner of weinsberg would enlarge your idea "i do not particularly relish have course of reading

general impression that it look like bride cake "all right doctor the general say good humouredly perceive how entirely accidental the incident be there be no reason why you should not see it and stretch out his hand he pull away the linen cover for the second time then perceive that what have take for bride cake be really an admirably execute model of lofty range of mountain whose snow clothe
