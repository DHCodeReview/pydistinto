disaster "as the captain be speak the parlour door open and the mate of the barque tall red bearded sailor step in he have obtain complete rig out from some kind hearted fisherman and look in his comfortable jersey and well grease seaboot very favourable speciman of shipwreck mariner with few word of grateful acknowledgment of our hospitality he draw chair up to the fire and warm his great brown hand before the blaze "what d'ye think now captain meadows he ask presently glance up at his superior officer do n't warn you what would be the upshot of have those nigger on board thebelinda the captain leant back in his chair and laugh heartily "didn't tell you he cry appeal to we do n't tell you?""it might have be no laugh matter for we the other remark petulantly have lose good sea kit and nearly my life into the bargain ""do understand you to say say that you attribute your misfortune to your ill fate passengers?"the mate open his eye at the adjective "why ill fate sir he ask "because they be most certainly drown answer he sniff incredulously and go on warm his hand "men of that kind be never drown he say after pause their father the devil look after they do you see they stand on the poop and roll cigarette at the time when the mizzen be carry away and the quarter boat stove that be enough for i be not surprised at you landsman not be able to take it in but the captain here who be be sail since he be the height of the binnacle ought to know by this time that cat and priest be the bad cargo you can carry if christian priest be bad guess an idolatrous pagan one be fifty time bad stand by the old religion and be to it!"my father and could not help laugh at the rough sailor 's very unorthodox way of proclaim his orthodoxy the mate however be evidently in deadly earnest and proceed to state his case mark off the different point upon the rough red finger of his left hand "it be at kurrachee directly after they come that warn ye he say reproachfully to the captain there be three buddhist lascars in my watch and what do they do when they chap come aboard why they down on their stomach and rub their nose on the deck that be what they do they would n't ha do as much for an admiral of the r'yal navy they know who be who these nigger do and smell mischief the moment see they on their face ask they afterwards in your presence captain why they have do it and they answer that the passenger be holy man you hear 'em yourself ""well there be no harm in that hawkins say captain meadows "i do n't know that the mate say doubtfully the holy christian be the one that be near god but the holy nigger be in my opinion the one that be near the devil then you see yourself captain meadows how they go on during the voyage read book that be writ on wood instead paper and sit up right through the night to jabber together on the quarter deck what do they want to have chart of their own for and to mark the course of the vessel every day?""they do n't say the captain "indeed they do and if do not tell you soon it be because you be always ready to laugh at what say about they they have instrument their own when they use they ca n't say but every day at noon they work out the latitude and longitude and mark out the vessel 's position on chart that be pin on their cabin table see they at it and so do the steward from his pantry ""well do n't see what you prove from that the captain remark though confess it be strange thing ""i'll tell you another strange thing say the mate impressively do you know the name of this bay in which we be cast away?""i have learn from our kind friend here that we be upon the wigtownshire coast the captain answer but have not hear the name of the bay "the mate leant forward with grave face "it be the bay of kirkmaiden he say if he expect to astonish captain meadows he certainly succeed for that gentleman be fairly bereft of speech for minute or more "this be really marvellous he say after time turn to we these passenger of ours cross question we early in the voyage as to the existence of bay of that name hawkin here and deny all knowledge of one for on the chart it be include in the bay of luce that we should eventually be blow into it and destroy be an extraordinary coincidence ""too extraordinary to be coincidence growl the mate see they during the calm yesterday morning point to the land over our starboard quarter they know well enough that that be the port they be make for ""what do you make of it all then hawkins ask the captain with troubled face what be your own theory on the matter?""why in my opinion the mate answer they three swab have no more difficulty in raise gale wind than should have in swallow this here grog they have reason their own for come to this god forsaken save your presence sir this god forsake bay and they take short cut to it by arrange to be blow ashore there that be my idea the matter though what three buddhist priest could find to do in the bay of kirkmaiden be clean past my comprehension "my father raise his eyebrow to indicate the doubt which his hospitality forbid he from put into word "i think gentleman he say that you be both sorely in need of rest after your perilous adventure if you will follow i shall lead you to your room "he conduct they with old fashioned ceremony to the laird 's good spare bedroom and then return to i in the parlour propose that we should go down together to the beach and learn whether anything fresh have occur the first pale light of dawn be just appear in the east when we make our way for the second time to the scene of the shipwreck the gale have blow itself out but the sea be still very high and all inside the breaker be seething gleam line of foam as though the fierce old ocean be gnash its white fang at the victim who have escape from its clutch all along the beach fisherman and crofter be hard at work haul up spar and barrel as fast as they be toss ashore none of they have see any body however and they explain to we that only such thing as could float have any chance of come ashore for the undercurrent be so strong that whatever be beneath the surface must infallibly be sweep out to sea as to the possibility of the unfortunate passenger having be able to reach the shore these practical man would not hear of it for moment and show we conclusively that if they have not be drown they must have be dash to piece upon the rock "we do all that could be do my father say sadly as we return home be afraid that the poor mate have have his reason affect by the suddenness of the disaster do you hear what he say about buddhist priest raise gale?""yes hear he say i. it be very painful to listen to he say my father wonder if he would object to my put small mustard plaster under each of his ear it would relieve any congestion of the brain or perhaps it would be good to wake he up and give he two antibilious pill what do you think jack?""i think say with yawn that you have well let he sleep and go to sleep yourself you can physic he in the morning if he need it "so say stumble off to my bedroom and throw myself upon the couch be soon in dreamless slumber it must have be eleven or twelve o'clock before awake and it seem to i in the flood of golden light which stream into my chamber that the wild tumultuous episode of the night before must have form part of some fantastic dream it be hard to believe that the gentle breeze which whisper so softly among the ivy leave around my window be cause by the same element which have shake the very house few short hour before it be as if nature have repent of her momentary passion and be endeavour to make amend to an injured world by its warmth and its sunshine chorus of bird in the garden below fill the whole air with their wonder and congratulation down in the hall find number of the shipwreck sailor look all the well for their night 's repose who set up buzz of pleasure and gratitude upon see i arrangement have be make to drive they to wigtown whence they be to proceed to glasgow by the evening train and my father have give order that each should be serve with packet of sandwich and hard boil egg to sustain he on the way captain meadows thank we warmly in the name of his employer for the manner in which we have treat they and he call for three cheer from his crew which be very heartily give he and the mate walk down with we after we have break our fast to have last look at the scene of the disaster the great bosom of the bay be still heave convulsively and its wave be break into sob against the rock but there be none of that wild turmoil which we have see in the early morning the long emerald ridge with their little white crest of foam roll slowly and majestically in to break with regular rhythm the panting of tired monster cable length from the shore we could see the mainmast of the barque float upon the wave disappear at time in the trough of the sea and then shoot up towards heaven like giant javelin shine and dripping as the roller toss it about other small piece of wreckage dot the water while innumerable spar and package be litter over the sand these be be draw up and collect in place of safety by gang of peasant notice that couple of broad wing gull be hover and skim over the scene of the shipwreck as though many strange thing be visible to they beneath the wave at time we could hear their raucous voice as they cry to one another of what they see "she be leaky old craft say the captain look sadly out to sea but there be always feeling of sorrow when we see the last of ship we have sail in well well she would have be break up in any case and sell for firewood ""it look peaceful scene remark who would imagine that three man lose their life last night in those very waters?""poor fellow say the captain with feeling should they be cast up after our departure be sure mr. west that you will have they decently inter "i be about to make some reply when the mate burst into loud guffaw slap his thigh and choke with merriment "if you want to bury they he say you have well look sharp or they may clear out of the country you remember what say last night just look at the top of that ere hillock and tell i whether be in the right or not?"there be high sand dune some little distance along the coast and upon the summit of this the figure be stand which have attract the mate 's attention the captain throw up his hand in astonishment as his eye rest upon it "by the eternal he shout it be ram singh himself let we overhaul him!"taking to his heel in his excitement he race along the beach follow by the mate and myself as well as by one or two of the fisherman who have observe the presence of the stranger the latter perceive our approach come down from his post of observation and walk quietly in our direction with his head sink upon his breast like one who be absorb in thought could not help contrast our hurried and tumultuous advance with the gravity and dignity of this lonely oriental nor be the matter mend when he raise pair of steady thoughtful dark eye and incline his head in graceful sweeping salutation it seem to i that we be like pack of schoolboy in the presence of master the stranger 's broad unruffled brow his clear search gaze firm set yet sensitive mouth and clean cut resolute expression all combine to form the most impose and noble presence which have ever know could not have imagine that such imperturbable calm and at the same time such consciousness of latent strength could have be express by any human face he be dress in brown velveteen coat loose dark trouser with shirt that be cut low in the collar so as to show the muscular brown neck and he still wear the red fez which have notice the night before observe with feeling of surprise as we approach he that none of these garment show the slight indication of the rough treatment and wet which they must have receive during their wearer 's submersion and struggle to the shore "so you be none the bad for your ducking he say in pleasant musical voice look from the captain to the mate hope that your poor sailor have find pleasant quarter ""we be all safe the captain answer but we have give you up for lose you and your two friend indeed be just make arrangement for your burial with mr. west here "the stranger look at i and smile "we wo n't give mr. west that trouble for little time yet he remark my friend and come ashore all safe and we have find shelter in hut mile or so along the coast it be lonely down there but we have everything which we can desire ""we start for glasgow this afternoon say the captain shall be very glad if you will come with we if you have not be in england before you may find it awkward travel alone ""we be very much indebted to you for your thoughtfulness ram singh answer but we will not take advantage of your kind offer since nature have drive we here we intend to have look about we before we leave ""as you like the captain say shrug his shoulder do n't think you be likely to find very much to interest you in this hole of place ""very possibly not ram singh answer with an amused smile you remember milton 's line the mind be its own place and in itself can make hell of heaven heaven of hell 'i dare say we can spend few day here comfortably enough indeed think you must be wrong in consider this to be barbarous locality be much mistaken if this young gentleman 's father be not mr. james hunter west whose name be know and honour by the pundit of india ""my father be indeed well know sanscrit scholar answer in astonishment "the presence of such man observe the stranger slowly change wilderness into city one great mind be surely high indication of civilisation than be incalculable league of brick and mortar "your father be hardly so profound as sir william jones or so universal as the baron von hammer purgstall but he combine many of the virtue of each you may tell he however from i that he be mistaken in the analogy which he have trace between the samoyede and tamulic word root ""if you have determine to honour our neighbourhood by short stay say you will offend my father very much if you do not put up with he he represent the laird here and it be the laird 's privilege accord to our scottish custom to entertain all stranger of repute who visit this parish "my sense of hospitality prompt i to deliver this invitation though could feel the mate twitch at my sleeve as if to warn i that the offer be for some reason an objectionable one his fear be however unnecessary for the stranger signify by shake of the head that it be impossible for he to accept it "my friend and be very much oblige to you he say but we have our own reason for remain where we be the hut which we occupy be desert and partly ruin but we eastern have train ourselves to do without most of those thing which be look upon as necessary in europe believe firmly in that wise axiom that man be rich not in proportion to what he have but in proportion to what he can dispense with good fisherman supply we with bread and with herb we have clean dry straw for our couch what could man wish for more?""but you must feel the cold at night come straight from the tropic remark the captain perhaps our body be cold sometimes we have not notice it we have all three spend many year in the upper himalayas on the border of the region of eternal snow so we be not very sensitive to inconvenience of the sort ""at least say you must allow i to send you over some fish and some meat from our larder ""we be not christians he answer but buddhist of the high school we do not recognise that man have moral right to slay an ox or fish for the gross use of his body he have not put life into they and have assuredly no mandate from the almighty to take life from they save under most pressing need we could not therefore use your gift if you be to send it ""but sir remonstrate if in this changeable and inhospitable climate you refuse all nourishing food your vitality will fail you you will die ""we shall die then he answer with an amused smile and now captain meadows must bid you adieu thank you for your kindness during the voyage and you too good bye you will command ship of your own before the year be out trust mr. west that may see you again before leave this part of the country farewell!"he raise his red fez incline his noble head with the stately grace which characterise all his action and stride away in the direction from which he have come "let i congratulate you mr. hawkins say the captain to the mate as we walk homeward you be to command your own ship within the year ""no such luck the mate answer with pleased smile upon his mahogany face still there be no say how thing may come out what d'ye think of he mr. west?""why say be very much interested in he what magnificent head and bear he have for young man suppose he can not be more than thirty ""forty say the mate "sixty if he be day remark captain meadows why have hear he talk quite familiarly of the first afghan war he be man then and that be close on forty year ago ""wonderful ejaculate his skin be as smooth and his eye be as clear as mine be he be the superior priest of the three no doubt ""the inferior say the captain confidently that be why he do all the talking for they their mind be too elevate to descend to mere worldly chatter ""they be the strange piece of flotsam and jetsam that be ever throw upon this coast remark my father will be mightily interested in they ""indeed think the less you have to do with they the well for you say the mate if do command my own ship 'll promise you that never carry live stock of that sort on board of she but here we be all aboard and the anchor trip so we must bid you good bye "the wagonette have just finish load up when we arrive and the chief place on either side of the driver have be reserve for my two companion who speedily spring into they with chorus of cheer the good fellow whirl away down the road while my father esther and stand upon the lawn and wave our hand to they until they disappear behind the cloomber wood en routefor the wigtown railway station barque and crew have both vanish now from our little world the only relic of either be the heap ofdebrisupon the beach which be to lie there until the arrival of an agent from lloyd's at dinner that evening mention to my father the episode of the three buddhist priest and find as have expect that he be very much interested by my account of they when however he hear of the high manner in which ram singh have speak of he and the distinguished position which he have assign he among philologist he become so excited that it be all we could do to prevent he from set off then and there to make his acquaintance esther and be relieve and glad when we at last succeed in abstract his boot and manoeuvre he to his bedroom for the exciting event of the last twenty four hour have be too much for his weak frame and delicate nerve be sit at the open porch in the gloaming turn over in my mind the unexpected event which have occur so rapidly the gale the wreck the rescue and the strange character of the castaway when my sister come quietly over to i and put her hand in mine "don't you think jack she say in her low sweet voice that we be forget our friend over at cloomber have n't all this excitement drive their fear and their danger out of our heads?""out of our head but never out of our heart say laugh however you be right little one for our attention have certainly be distract from they shall walk up in the morning and see if can see anything of they by the way to morrow be the fateful 5th of october one more day and all will be well with we ""or ill say my sister gloomily "why what little croaker you be to be sure cry what in the world be come over you?""i feel nervous and low spirited she answer draw close to my side and shiver feel as if some great peril be hang over the head of those we love why should these strange man wish to stay upon the coast?""what the buddhist say lightly oh these fellow have continual feast day and religious rite of all sort they have some very good reason for stay you may be sure ""don't you think say esther in an awe strike whisper that it be very strange that these priest should arrive here all the way from india just at the present moment have you not gather from all you have hear that the general 's fear be in some way connect with india and the indians?"the remark make i thoughtful "why now that you mention it answer have some vague impression that the mystery be connect with some incident which occur in that country be sure however that your fear would vanish if you see ram singh he be the very personification of wisdom and benevolence he be shock at the idea of our kill sheep or even fish for his benefit say he would rather die than have hand in take the life of an animal ""it be very foolish of i to be so nervous say my sister bravely but you must promise i one thing jack you will go up to cloomber in the morning and if you can see any of they you must tell they of these strange neighbour of ours they be well able to judge than we be whether their presence have any significance or not ""all right little one answer as we go indoor you have be over excited by all these wild doing and you need sound night 's rest to compose you 'll do what you suggest however
