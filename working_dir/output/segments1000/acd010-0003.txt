terror mr. malone we must bring the man to his bearing 'll have leaderette on he to morrow that will raise blister just give i the material and will engage to brand the fellow for ever professor munchausen how be that for an inset headline sir john mandeville redivivus cagliostro all the imposter and bully in history 'll show he up for the fraud he be ""i would n't do that sir ""why not?""because he be not fraud at all ""what roar mcardle you do n't mean to say you really believe this stuff of his about mammoth and mastodon and great sea sairpents?""well do n't know about that do n't think he make any claim of that kind but do believe he have get something new ""then for heaven 's sake man write it up!""i'm longing to but all know he give i in confidence and on condition that do n't condense into few sentence the professor 's narrative that be how it stand "mcardle look deeply incredulous "well mr. malone he say at last about this scientific meeting to night there can be no privacy about that anyhow do n't suppose any paper will want to report it for waldron have be report already dozen time and no one be aware that challenger will speak we may get scoop if we be lucky you 'll be there in any case so you 'll just give we pretty full report 'll keep space up to midnight "my day be busy one and have an early dinner at the savage club with tarp henry to whom give some account of my adventure he listen with sceptical smile on his gaunt face and roar with laughter on hear that the professor have convince i "my dear chap thing do n't happen like that in real life people do n't stumble upon enormous discovery and then lose their evidence leave that to the novelist the fellow be as full of trick as the monkey house at the zoo it be all bosh ""but the american poet?""he never exist ""i see his sketch book ""challenger 's sketch book ""you think he draw that animal?""of course he do who else?""well then the photographs?""there be nothing in the photograph by your own admission you only see bird ""a pterodactyl ""that be what he say he put the pterodactyl into your head ""well then the bones?""first one out of an irish stew second one vamp up for the occasion if you be clever and know your business you can fake bone as easily as you can photograph "i begin to feel uneasy perhaps after all have be premature in my acquiescence then have sudden happy thought "will you come to the meeting ask tarp henry look thoughtful "he be not popular person the genial challenger say he lot of people have account to settle with he should say he be about the well hate man in london if the medical student turn out there will be no end of rag do n't want to get into bear garden ""you might at least do he the justice to hear he state his own case ""well perhaps it be only fair all right be your man for the evening "when we arrive at the hall we find much great concourse than have expect line of electric brougham discharge their little cargo of white bearded professor while the dark stream of humbler pedestrian who crowd through the arched door way show that the audience would be popular as well as scientific indeed it become evident to we as soon as we have take our seat that youthful and even boyish spirit be abroad in the gallery and the back portion of the hall look behind i could see row of face of the familiar medical student type apparently the great hospital have each send down their contingent the behavior of the audience at present be good humor but mischievous scrap of popular song be chorus with an enthusiasm which be strange prelude to scientific lecture and there be already tendency to personal chaff which promise jovial evening to other however embarrass it might be to the recipient of these dubious honor thus when old doctor meldrum with his well know curly brim opera hat appear upon the platform there be such universal query of where do you get that tile that he hurriedly remove it and conceal it furtively under his chair when gouty professor wadley limp down to his seat there be general affectionate inquiry from all part of the hall as to the exact state of his poor toe which cause he obvious embarrassment the great demonstration of all however be at the entrance of my new acquaintance professor challenger when he pass down to take his place at the extreme end of the front row of the platform such yell of welcome break forth when his black beard first protrude round the corner that begin to suspect tarp henry be right in his surmise and that this assemblage be there not merely for the sake of the lecture but because it have got rumor abroad that the famous professor would take part in the proceeding there be some sympathetic laughter on his entrance among the front bench of well dress spectator as though the demonstration of the student in this instance be not unwelcome to they that greeting be indeed frightful outburst of sound the uproar of the carnivora cage when the step of the bucket bear keeper be hear in the distance there be an offensive tone in it perhaps and yet in the main it strike i as mere riotous outcry the noisy reception of one who amuse and interest they rather than of one they dislike or despise challenger smile with weary and tolerant contempt as kindly man would meet the yapping of litter of puppy he sit slowly down blow out his chest pass his hand caressingly down his beard and look with droop eyelid and supercilious eye at the crowded hall before he the uproar of his advent have not yet die away when professor ronald murray the chairman and mr. waldron the lecturer thread their way to the front and the proceeding begin professor murray will be sure excuse i if say that he have the common fault of most englishman of be inaudible why on earth people who have something to say which be worth hearing should not take the slight trouble to learn how to make it hear be one of the strange mystery of modern life their method be as reasonable as to try to pour some precious stuff from the spring to the reservoir through non conduct pipe which could by the least effort be open professor murray make several profound remark to his white tie and to the water carafe upon the table with humorous twinkle aside to the silver candlestick upon his right then he sit down and mr. waldron the famous popular lecturer rise amid general murmur of applause he be stern gaunt man with harsh voice and an aggressive manner but he have the merit of know how to assimilate the idea of other man and to pass they on in way which be intelligible and even interesting to the lay public with happy knack of be funny about the most unlikely object so that the precession of the equinox or the formation of vertebrate become highly humorous process as treat by he it be bird's eye view of creation as interpret by science which in language always clear and sometimes picturesque he unfold before we he tell we of the globe huge mass of flame gas flare through the heaven then he picture the solidification the cooling the wrinkling which form the mountain the steam which turn to water the slow preparation of the stage upon which be to be play the inexplicable drama of life on the origin of life itself he be discreetly vague that the germ of it could hardly have survive the original roasting be he declare fairly certain therefore it have come later have it build itself out of the cooling inorganic element of the globe very likely have the germ of it arrive from outside upon meteor it be hardly conceivable on the whole the wise man be the least dogmatic upon the point we could not or at least we have not succeed up to date in make organic life in our laboratory out of inorganic material the gulf between the dead and the living be something which our chemistry could not as yet bridge but there be high and subtler chemistry of nature which work with great force over long epoch might well produce result which be impossible for we there the matter must be leave this bring the lecturer to the great ladder of animal life begin low down in mollusc and feeble sea creature then up rung by rung through reptile and fish till at last we come to kangaroo rat creature which bring forth its young alive the direct ancestor of all mammal and presumably therefore of everyone in the audience no no from sceptical student in the back row if the young gentleman in the red tie who cry no no and who presumably claim to have be hatch out of an egg would wait upon he after the lecture he would be glad to see such curiosity laughter it be strange to think that the climax of all the age long process of nature have be the creation of that gentleman in the red tie but have the process stop be this gentleman to be take as the final type the be all and end all of development he hope that he would not hurt the feeling of the gentleman in the red tie if he maintain that whatever virtue that gentleman might possess in private life still the vast process of the universe be not fully justified if they be to end entirely in his production evolution be not spend force but one still work and even great achievement be in store have thus amid general titter play very prettily with his interrupter the lecturer go back to his picture of the past the drying of the sea the emergence of the sand bank the sluggish viscous life which lie upon their margin the overcrowded lagoon the tendency of the sea creature to take refuge upon the mud flat the abundance of food await they their consequent enormous growth hence lady and gentleman he add that frightful brood of saurian which still affright our eye when see in the wealden or in the solenhofen slate but which be fortunately extinct long before the first appearance of mankind upon this planet ""question boom voice from the platform mr. waldron be strict disciplinarian with gift of acid humor as exemplify upon the gentleman with the red tie which make it perilous to interrupt he but this interjection appear to he so absurd that he be at loss how to deal with it so look the shakespearean who be confront by rancid baconian or the astronomer who be assail by flat earth fanatic he pause for moment and then raise his voice repeat slowly the word which be extinct before the coming of man ""question boom the voice once more waldron look with amazement along the line of professor upon the platform until his eye fall upon the figure of challenger who lean back in his chair with closed eye and an amused expression as if he be smile in his sleep "i see say waldron with shrug it be my friend professor challenger and amid laughter he renew his lecture as if this be final explanation and no more need be say but the incident be far from be close whatever path the lecturer take amid the wild of the past seem invariably to lead he to some assertion as to extinct or prehistoric life which instantly bring the same bull bellow from the professor the audience begin to anticipate it and to roar with delight when it come the pack bench of student join in and every time challenger 's beard open before any sound could come forth there be yell of question from hundred voice and an answer counter cry of order and shame from as many more waldron though harden lecturer and strong man became rattle he hesitate stammer repeat himself got snarl in long sentence and finally turn furiously upon the cause of his trouble "this be really intolerable he cry glare across the platform must ask you professor challenger to cease these ignorant and unmannerly interruption "there be hush over the hall the student rigid with delight at see the high god on olympus quarrel among themselves challenger lever his bulky figure slowly out of his chair "i must in turn ask you mr. waldron he say to cease to make assertion which be not in strict accordance with scientific fact "the word unloose temp shame shame give he hearing put he out shove he off the platform fair play emerge from general roar of amusement or execration the chairman be on his foot flap both his hand and bleat excitedly professor challenger personal view later be the solid peak above his cloud of inaudible mutter the interrupter bow smile stroke his beard and relapse into his chair waldron very flushed and warlike continue his observation now and then as he make an assertion he shoot venomous glance at his opponent who seem to be slumber deeply with the same broad happy smile upon his face at last the lecture come to an end be inclined to think that it be premature one as the peroration be hurried and disconnected the thread of the argument have be rudely break and the audience be restless and expectant waldron sit down and after chirrup from the chairman professor challenger rise and advance to the edge of the platform in the interest of my paper take down his speech verbatim "ladie and gentleman he begin amid sustained interruption from the back beg pardon lady gentlemen and child must apologize have inadvertently omit considerable section of this audience tumult during which the professor stand with one hand raise and his enormous head nod sympathetically as if he be bestow pontifical blessing upon the crowd have be select to move vote of thank to mr. waldron for the very picturesque and imaginative address to which we have just listen there be point in it with which disagree and it have be my duty to indicate they as they arise but none the less mr. waldron have accomplish his object well that object be to give simple and interesting account of what he conceive to have be the history of our planet popular lecture be the easy to listen to but mr. waldron here he beam and blink at the lecturer will excuse i when say that they be necessarily both superficial and misleading since they have to be grade to the comprehension of an ignorant audience ironical cheer popular lecturer be in their nature parasitic angry gesture of protest from mr. waldron they exploit for fame or cash the work which have be do by their indigent and unknown brother one small new fact obtain in the laboratory one brick build into the temple of science far outweigh any second hand exposition which pass an idle hour but can leave no useful result behind it put forward this obvious reflection not out of any desire to disparage mr. waldron in particular but that you may not lose your sense of proportion and mistake the acolyte for the high priest at this point mr. waldron whisper to the chairman who half rise and say something severely to his water carafe but enough of this loud and prolong cheer let i pass to some subject of wide interest what be the particular point upon which as an original investigator have challenge our lecturer 's accuracy it be upon the permanence of certain type of animal life upon the earth do not speak upon this subject as an amateur nor may add as popular lecturer but speak as one whose scientific conscience compel he to adhere closely to fact when say that mr. waldron be very wrong in suppose that because he have never himself see so call prehistoric animal therefore these creature no long exist they be indeed as he have say our ancestor but they be if may use the expression our contemporary ancestor who can still be find with all their hideous and formidable characteristic if one have but the energy and hardihood to seek their haunt creature which be suppose to be jurassic monster who would hunt down and devour our large and fiercest mammal still exist cry of bosh prove it how do you know question how do know you ask i know because have visit their secret haunt know because have see some of they applause uproar and voice liar be liar general hearty and noisy assent do hear someone say that be liar will the person who call i liar kindly stand up that may know he voice here he be sir and an inoffensive little person in spectacle struggle violently be hold up among group of student do you venture to call i liar no sir no shout the accuse and disappear like jack in the box if any person in this hall dare to doubt my veracity shall be glad to have few word with he after the lecture liar who say that again the inoffensive one plunge desperately be elevate high into the air if come down among you general chorus of come love come which interrupt the proceeding for some moment while the chairman stand up and wave both his arm seem to be conduct the music the professor with his face flush his nostril dilate and his beard bristling be now in proper berserk mood every great discoverer have be meet with the same incredulity the sure brand of generation of fool when great fact be lay before you you have not the intuition the imagination which would help you to understand they you can only throw mud at the man who have risk their life to open new field to science you persecute the prophet galileo darwin and prolonged cheering and complete interruption.)all this be from my hurried note take at the time which give little notion of the absolute chaos to which the assembly have by this time be reduce so terrific be the uproar that several lady have already beat hurried retreat grave and reverend senior seem to have catch the prevail spirit as badly as the student and see white bearded man rise and shake their fist at the obdurate professor the whole great audience seethe and simmer like boiling pot the professor take step forward and raise both his hand there be something so big and arrest and virile in the man that the clatter and shout die gradually away before his commanding gesture and his masterful eye he seem to have definite message they hush to hear it "i will not detain you he say it be not worth it truth be truth and the noise of number of foolish young man and fear must add of their equally foolish senior can not affect the matter claim that have open new field of science you dispute it cheer then put you to the test will you accredit one or more of your own number to go out as your representative and test my statement in your name?"mr summerlee the veteran professor of comparative anatomy rise among the audience tall thin bitter man with the withered aspect of theologian he wish he say to ask professor challenger whether the result to which he have allude in his remark have be obtain during journey to the headwater of the amazon make by he two year before professor challenger answer that they have mr. summerlee desire to know how it be that professor challenger claim to have make discovery in those region which have be overlook by wallace bates and other previous explorer of establish scientific repute professor challenger answer that mr. summerlee appear to be confuse the amazon with the thames that it be in reality somewhat large river that mr. summerlee might be interested to know that with the orinoco which communicate with it some fifty thousand mile of country be open up and that in so vast space it be not impossible for one person to find what another have miss mr. summerlee declare with an acid smile that he fully appreciate the difference between the thames and the amazon which lie in the fact that any assertion about the former could be test while about the latter it could not he would be oblige if professor challenger would give the latitude and the longitude of the country in which prehistoric animal be to be find professor challenger reply that he reserve such information for good reason of his own but would be prepare to give it with proper precaution to committee choose from the audience would mr. summerlee serve on such committee and test his story in person?mr summerlee yes will great cheering.)professor challenger then guarantee that will place in your hand such material as will enable you to find your way it be only right however since mr. summerlee go to check my statement that should have one or more with he who may check his will not disguise from you that there be difficulty and danger mr. summerlee will need young colleague may ask for volunteers?"it be thus that the great crisis of man 's life spring out at he could have imagine when enter that hall that be about to pledge myself to wilder adventure than have ever come to i in my dream but gladys be it not the very opportunity of which she speak gladys would have tell i to go have spring to my foot be speak and yet have prepare no word tarp henry my companion be plucking at my skirt and hear he whisper sit down malone do n't make public ass of yourself at the same time be aware that tall thin man with dark gingery hair few seat in front of i be also upon his foot he glare back at i with hard angry eye but refuse to give way "i will go mr. chairman keep repeat over and over again "name name cry the audience "my name be edward dunn malone be the reporter of the daily gazette claim to be an absolutely unprejudiced witness ""what be your name sir the chairman ask of my tall rival "i be lord john roxton have already be up the amazon know all the ground and have special qualification for this investigation ""lord john roxton 's reputation as sportsman and traveler be of course world famous say the chairman at the same time it would certainly be as well to have member of the press upon such an expedition ""then move say professor challenger that both these gentleman be elect as representative of this meeting to accompany professor summerlee upon his journey to investigate and to report upon the truth of my statement "and so amid shout and cheer our fate be decide and find myself borne away in the human current which swirl towards the door with my mind half stun by the vast new project which have rise so suddenly before it as emerge from the hall be conscious for moment of rush of laugh student down the pavement and of an arm wield heavy umbrella which rise and fall in the midst of they then amid mixture of groan and cheer professor challenger 's electric brougham slide from the curb and find myself walk under the silvery light of regent street full of thought of gladys and of wonder as to my future suddenly there be touch at my elbow turn and find myself look into the humorous masterful eye of the tall
