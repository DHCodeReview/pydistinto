he have get among we we should have shoot each other in tryin to down he on the other hand if we have fire through the hedge and wound he he would soon have be on the top of we to say nothin' of give ourselves away on the whole think that we be jolly well out of it what be he then?"our learn man look at each other with some hesitation "personally be unable to classify the creature with any certainty say summerlee light his pipe from the fire "in refuse to commit yourself you be but show proper scientific reserve say challenger with massive condescension be not myself prepared to go far than to say in general term that we have almost certainly be in contact to night with some form of carnivorous dinosaur have already express my anticipation that something of the sort might exist upon this plateau ""we have to bear in mind remark summerlee that there be many prehistoric form which have never come down to we it would be rash to suppose that we can give name to all that we be likely to meet ""exactly rough classification may be the good that we can attempt to morrow some further evidence may help we to an identification meantime we can only renew our interrupted slumber ""but not without sentinel say lord john with decision we ca n't afford to take chance in country like this two hour spell in the future for each of we ""then 'll just finish my pipe in start the first one say professor summerlee and from that time onwards we never trust ourselves again without watchman in the morning it be not long before we discover the source of the hideous uproar which have arouse we in the night the iguanodon glade be the scene of horrible butchery from the pool of blood and the enormous lump of flesh scatter in every direction over the green sward we imagine at first that number of animal have be kill but on examine the remain more closely we discover that all this carnage come from one of these unwieldy monster which have be literally tear to piece by some creature not large perhaps but far more ferocious than itself our two professor sit in absorb argument examine piece after piece which show the mark of savage tooth and of enormous claw "our judgment must still be in abeyance say professor challenger with huge slab of whitish colored flesh across his knee the indication would be consistent with the presence of saber toothed tiger such as be still find among the breccia of our cavern but the creature actually see be undoubtedly of large and more reptilian character personally should pronounce for allosaurus ""or megalosaurus say summerlee "exactly any one of the large carnivorous dinosaur would meet the case among they be to be find all the most terrible type of animal life that have ever curse the earth or bless museum he laugh sonorously at his own conceit for though he have little sense of humor the crude pleasantry from his own lip move he always to roar of appreciation "the less noise the well say lord roxton curtly we do n't know who or what may be near we if this fellah come back for his breakfast and catch we here we wo n't have so much to laugh at by the way what be this mark upon the iguanodon 's hide?"on the dull scaly slate color skin somewhere above the shoulder there be singular black circle of some substance which look like asphalt none of we could suggest what it mean though summerlee be of opinion that he have see something similar upon one of the young one two day before challenger say nothing but look pompous and puffy as if he could if he would so that finally lord john ask his opinion direct "if your lordship will graciously permit i to open my mouth shall be happy to express my sentiment say he with elaborate sarcasm be not in the habit of be take to task in the fashion which seem to be customary with your lordship be not aware that it be necessary to ask your permission before smile at harmless pleasantry "it be not until he have receive his apology that our touchy friend would suffer himself to be appeased when at last his ruffled feeling be at ease he address we at some length from his seat upon fallen tree speak as his habit be as if he be impart most precious information to class of thousand "with regard to the marking say he be inclined to agree with my friend and colleague professor summerlee that the stain be from asphalt as this plateau be in its very nature highly volcanic and as asphalt be substance which one associate with plutonic force can not doubt that it exist in the free liquid state and that the creature may have come in contact with it much more important problem be the question as to the existence of the carnivorous monster which have leave its trace in this glade we know roughly that this plateau be not large than an average english county within this confine space certain number of creature mostly type which have pass away in the world below have live together for innumerable year now it be very clear to i that in so long period one would have expect that the carnivorous creature multiply unchecked would have exhaust their food supply and have be compel to either modify their flesh eat habit or die of hunger this we see have not be so we can only imagine therefore that the balance of nature be preserve by some check which limit the number of these ferocious creature one of the many interesting problem therefore which await our solution be to discover what that check may be and how it operate venture to trust that we may have some future opportunity for the close study of the carnivorous dinosaur ""and venture to trust we may not observe the professor only raise his great eyebrow as the schoolmaster meet the irrelevant observation of the naughty boy "perhap professor summerlee may have an observation to make he say and the two savant ascend together into some rarefied scientific atmosphere where the possibility of modification of the birth rate be weigh against the decline of the food supply as check in the struggle for existence that morning we map out small portion of the plateau avoid the swamp of the pterodactyls and keep to the east of our brook instead of to the west in that direction the country be still thickly woode with so much undergrowth that our progress be very slow have dwell up to now upon the terror of maple white land but there be another side to the subject for all that morning we wander among lovely flower mostly as observe white or yellow in color these be as our professor explain the primitive flower shade in many place the ground be absolutely cover with they and as we walk ankle deep on that wonderful yield carpet the scent be almost intoxicate in its sweetness and intensity the homely english bee buzz everywhere around we many of the tree under which we pass have their branch bow down with fruit some of which be of familiar sort while other variety be new by observe which of they be peck by the bird we avoid all danger of poison and add delicious variety to our food reserve in the jungle which we traverse be numerous hard trodden path make by the wild beast and in the more marshy place we see profusion of strange footmark include many of the iguanodon once in grove we observe several of these great creature grazing and lord john with his glass be able to report that they also be spot with asphalt though in different place to the one which we have examine in the morning what this phenomenon mean we could not imagine we see many small animal such as porcupine scaly ant eater and wild pig piebald in color and with long curved tusk once through break in the tree we see clear shoulder of green hill some distance away and across this large dun colored animal be travel at considerable pace it pass so swiftly that we be unable to say what it be but if it be deer as be claim by lord john it must have be as large as those monstrous irish elk which be still dig up from time to time in the bog of my native land ever since the mysterious visit which have be pay to our camp we always return to it with some misgiving however on this occasion we find everything in order that evening we have grand discussion upon our present situation and future plan which must describe at some length as it lead to new departure by which we be enable to gain more complete knowledge of maple white land than might have come in many week of explore it be summerlee who open the debate all day he have be querulous in manner and now some remark of lord john be as to what we should do on the morrow bring all his bitterness to head "what we ought to be do to day to morrow and all the time say he be find some way out of the trap into which we have fall you be all turn your brain towards get into this country say that we should be scheme how to get out of it ""i be surprised sir boom challenger stroke his majestic beard that any man of science should commit himself to so ignoble sentiment you be in land which offer such an inducement to the ambitious naturalist as none ever have since the world begin and you suggest leave it before we have acquire more than the most superficial knowledge of it or of its content expect well thing of you professor summerlee ""you must remember say summerlee sourly that have large class in london who be at present at the mercy of an extremely inefficient locum tenen this make my situation different from yours professor challenger since so far as know you have never be entrust with any responsible educational work ""quite so say challenger have feel it to be sacrilege to divert brain which be capable of the high original research to any less object that be why have sternly set my face against any proffered scholastic appointment ""for example ask summerlee with sneer but lord john hasten to change the conversation "i must say say he that think it would be mighty poor thing to go back to london before know great deal more of this place than do at present ""i could never dare to walk into the back office of my paper and face old mcardle say i. you will excuse the frankness of this report will you not sir he 'd never forgive i for leave such unexhausted copy behind i besides so far as can see it be not worth discuss since we ca n't get down even if we want ""our young friend make up for many obvious mental lacunae by some measure of primitive common sense remark challenger the interest of his deplorable profession be immaterial to we but as he observe we can not get down in any case so it be waste of energy to discuss it ""it be waste of energy to do anything else growl summerlee from behind his pipe let i remind you that we come here upon perfectly definite mission entrust to we at the meeting of the zoological institute in london that mission be to test the truth of professor challenger 's statement those statement as be bind to admit we be now in position to endorse our ostensible work be therefore do as to the detail which remain to be work out upon this plateau it be so enormous that only large expedition with very special equipment could hope to cope with it should we attempt to do so ourselves the only possible result must be that we shall never return with the important contribution to science which we have already gain professor challenger have devise mean for get we on to this plateau when it appear to be inaccessible think that we should now call upon he to use the same ingenuity in get we back to the world from which we come "i confes that as summerlee state his view it strike i as altogether reasonable even challenger be affect by the consideration that his enemy would never stand confute if the confirmation of his statement should never reach those who have doubt they "the problem of the descent be at first sight formidable one say he and yet can not doubt that the intellect can solve it be prepared to agree with our colleague that protract stay in maple white land be at present inadvisable and that the question of our return will soon have to be face absolutely refuse to leave however until we have make at least superficial examination of this country and be able to take back with we something in the nature of chart "professor summerlee give snort of impatience "we have spend two long day in exploration say he and we be no wise as to the actual geography of the place than when we start it be clear that it be all thickly woode and it would take month to penetrate it and to learn the relation of one part to another if there be some central peak it would be different but it all slope downwards so far as we can see the far we go the less likely it be that we will get any general view "it be at that moment that have my inspiration my eye chance to light upon the enormous gnarl trunk of the gingko tree which cast its huge branch over we surely if its bole exceed that of all other its height must do the same if the rim of the plateau be indeed the high point then why should this mighty tree not prove to be watchtower which command the whole country now ever since run wild as lad in ireland have be bold and skilled tree climber my comrade might be my master on the rock but know that would be supreme among those branch could only get my leg on to the low of the giant off shoot then it would be strange indeed if could not make my way to the top my comrade be delighted at my idea "our young friend say challenger bunch up the red apple of his cheek be capable of acrobatic exertion which would be impossible to man of more solid though possibly of more commanding appearance applaud his resolution ""by george young fellah you 've put your hand on it say lord john clap i on the back how we never come to think of it before ca n't imagine there be not more than an hour of daylight leave but if you take your notebook you may be able to get some rough sketch of the place if we put these three ammunition case under the branch will soon hoist you on to it "he stand on the box while face the trunk and be gently raise i when challenger spring forward and give i such thrust with his huge hand that he fairly shoot i into the tree with both arm clasp the branch scramble hard with my foot until have work first my body and then my knee onto it there be three excellent off shoot like huge rung of ladder above my head and tangle of convenient branch beyond so that clamber onwards with such speed that soon lose sight of the ground and have nothing but foliage beneath i now and then encounter check and once have to shin up creeper for eight or ten foot but make excellent progress and the booming of challenger 's voice seem to be great distance beneath i the tree be however enormous and look upwards could see no thinning of the leave above my head there be some thick bush like clump which seem to be parasite upon branch up which be swarm lean my head round it in order to see what be beyond and nearly fall out of the tree in my surprise and horror at what see face be gaze into mine at the distance of only foot or two the creature that own it have be crouch behind the parasite and have look round it at the same instant that do it be human face or at least it be far more human than any monkey be that have ever see it be long whitish and blotch with pimple the nose flatten and the low jaw projecting with bristle of coarse whisker round the chin the eye which be under thick and heavy brow be bestial and ferocious and as it open its mouth to snarl what sound like curse at i observe that it have curve sharp canine tooth for an instant read hatred and menace in the evil eye then as quick as flash come an expression of overpower fear there be crash of broken bough as it dive wildly down into the tangle of green catch glimpse of hairy body like that of reddish pig and then it be go amid swirl of leave and branch "what be the matter shout roxton from below anything wrong with you?""did you see it cry with my arm round the branch and all my nerve tingle "we hear row as if your foot have slip what be it?"i be so shocked at the sudden and strange appearance of this ape man that hesitate whether should not climb down again and tell my experience to my companion but be already so far up the great tree that it seem humiliation to return without having carry out my mission after long pause therefore to recover my breath and my courage continue my ascent once put my weight upon rotten branch and swing for few second by my hand but in the main it be all easy climbing gradually the leave thin around i and be aware from the wind upon my face that have top all the tree of the forest be determine however not to look about i before have reach the very high point so scramble on until have get so far that the topmost branch be bend beneath my weight there settle into convenient fork and balance myself securely find myself look down at most wonderful panorama of this strange country in which we find ourselves the sun be just above the western sky line and the evening be particularly bright and clear one so that the whole extent of the plateau be visible beneath i it be as see from this height of an oval contour with breadth of about thirty mile and width of twenty its general shape be that of shallow funnel all the side slope down to considerable lake in the center this lake may have be ten mile in circumference and lie very green and beautiful in the evening light with thick fringe of reed at its edge and with its surface break by several yellow sandbank which gleam golden in the mellow sunshine number of long dark object which be too large for alligator and too long for canoe lie upon the edge of these patch of sand with my glass could clearly see that they be alive but what their nature might be could not imagine from the side of the plateau on which we be slope of woodland with occasional glade stretch down for five or six mile to the central lake could see at my very foot the glade of the iguanodon and far off be round opening in the tree which mark the swamp of the pterodactyls on the side face i however the plateau present very different aspect there the basalt cliff of the outside be reproduce upon the inside form an escarpment about two hundred foot high with woody slope beneath it along the base of these red cliff some distance above the ground could see number of dark hole through the glass which conjecture to be the mouth of cave at the opening of one of these something white be shimmer but be unable to make out what it be sit chart the country until the sun have set and it be so dark that could no long distinguish detail then climb down to my companion wait for i so eagerly at the bottom of the great tree for once be the hero of the expedition alone have think of it and alone have do it and here be the chart which would save we month 's blind groping among unknown danger each of they shake i solemnly by the hand but before they discuss the detail of my map have to tell they of my encounter with the ape man among the branch "he have be there all the time say i."how do you know that ask lord john "because have never be without that feeling that something malevolent be watch we mention it to you professor challenger ""our young friend certainly say something of the kind he be also the one among we who be endow with that celtic temperament which would make he sensitive to such impression ""the whole theory of telepathy begin summerlee fill his pipe "is too vast to be now discuss say challenger with decision tell i now he add with the air of bishop address sunday school do you happen to observe whether the creature could cross its thumb over its palm?""no indeed ""had it tail?""no ""was the foot prehensile?""i do not think it could have make off so fast among the branch if it could not get grip with its foot ""in south america there be if my memory serve i you will check the observation professor summerlee some thirty six specie of monkey but the anthropoid ape be unknown it be clear however that he exist in this country and that he be not the hairy gorilla like variety which be never see out of africa or the east be inclined to interpolate as look at he that have see his first cousin in kensington this be whiskered and colorless type the latter characteristic pointing to the fact that he spend his day in arboreal seclusion the question which we have to face be whether he approach more closely to the ape or the man in the latter case he may well approximate to what the vulgar have call the missing link the solution of this problem be our immediate duty ""it be nothing of the sort say summerlee abruptly now that through the intelligence and activity of mr. malone can not help quote the word we have get our chart our one and only immediate duty be to get ourselves safe and sound out of this awful place ""the flesh pot of civilization groan challenger "the ink pot of civilization sir it be our task to put on record what we have see and to leave the further exploration to other you all agree as much before mr. malone get we the chart ""well say challenger admit that my mind will be more at ease when be assure that the result of our expedition have be convey to our friend how we be to get down from this place have not as yet an idea have never yet encounter any problem however which my inventive brain be unable to solve and promise you that to morrow will turn my attention to the question of our descent and so the matter be allow to rest but that evening by the light of the fire and of single candle the first map of the lost world be elaborate every detail which have roughly note from my watch tower be draw out in its relative place challenger 's pencil hover over the great blank which mark the lake "what shall we call it he ask "why should you not take the chance of perpetuate your own name say summerlee with his usual touch of acidity "i trust sir that my name will have other and more personal claim upon posterity say challenger severely any ignoramus can hand down his worthless memory by impose it upon mountain or river need no such monument "summerlee with twisted smile be about to make some fresh assault when lord john hasten to intervene "it be up to you young fellah to
