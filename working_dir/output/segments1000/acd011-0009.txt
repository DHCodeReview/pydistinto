and another remain below from the room above come shout cry for help and then the sound of trample foot and of fall chair an instant later gray haired man rush out on the landing he be seize before he could get far and his spectacle came tinkle down to mcmurdo 's foot there be thud and groan he be on his face and half dozen stick be clatter together as they fall upon he he writhe and his long thin limb quiver under the blow the other cease at last but baldwin his cruel face set in an infernal smile be hack at the man 's head which he vainly endeavour to defend with his arm his white hair be dabble with patch of blood baldwin be still stoop over his victim put in short vicious blow whenever he could see part expose when mcmurdo dash up the stair and push he back "you'll kill the man say

it can hardly be hope that their exertion will be attend by any well result than in the past some of the man be recognize and there be hope that conviction may be obtain the source of the outrage be it need hardly be say that infamous society which have hold this community in bondage for so long period and against which the herald have take so uncompromise stand mr. stanger 's many friend will rejoice to hear that though he have be cruelly and brutally beat and though he have sustain severe injury about the head there be no immediate danger to his life below it state that guard of police
