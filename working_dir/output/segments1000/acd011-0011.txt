be high revel in the lodge room at the union house that night not only over the killing of the manager and engineer of the crow hill mine which would bring this organization into line with the other blackmail and terror stricken company of the district but also over distant triumph which have be work by the hand of the lodge itself it would appear that when the county delegate have send over five good man to strike blow in vermissa he have demand that in return three vermissa man should be secretly select and send across to kill william hales of stake royal one of the well known and most popular mine owner in the gilmerton district man who be believe not to have an enemy in the world for he be in all way model employer he have insist however upon efficiency in the work and have

steep hill where his horse must be at walk he be so furred to keep out the cold that he could not lay his hand on his pistol they have pull he out and shoot he again and again he have scream for mercy the scream be repeat for the amusement of the lodge "let 's hear again how he squeal they cry none of they know the man but there be eternal drama in killing and they have show the scowrers of gilmerton that the vermissa man be to be rely upon there have be one contretemp for man and his wife have drive up while they be still empty their revolver into the silent body it have be suggest that they should shoot they both but they be harmless folk who be not connect with the mine so they be sternly bid to drive on and keep silent lest bad thing befall they and so the blood mottle figure have be leave as warning to all such hard hearted employer and the three noble avenger have hurry off into the mountain where unbroken nature come down to the very edge of the furnace and the slag heap here they be safe and sound their work well do and the plaudit of their companion in their ear it have be great day for the scowrers the shadow have fall even dark over the valley but as the wise general choose the moment of victory in which to redouble his effort so that his foe may have no time to steady themselves after disaster so boss mcginty look out upon the scene of his operation with his brooding and malicious eye have devise new attack upon those who oppose he that very night as the half drunken company break up he touch mcmurdo on the arm and lead he aside into that inner room where they have their first interview "see here my lad say he 've get job that be worthy of you at last you 'll have the doing of it in your own hand ""proud be to hear it mcmurdo answer "you can take

if you can down he ""i'll do my good anyhow who be he and where shall find him?"mcginty take his eternal half chewed half smoke cigar from the corner of his mouth and proceed to draw rough diagram on page tear from his notebook "he be the chief foreman of the iron dike company he be hard citizen an old colour sergeant of the war all scar and grizzle we 've have two try at he but have no luck and jim carnaway lose his life over it now it be for you to take it over that be the house all alone at the iron dike crossroad same as you see here on the map without another within earshot it be no good

that may see the house and make my plan then very good say mcginty shake he by the hand leave it with you it will be great day when you bring we the news it be just the last stroke that will bring they all to their knee "mcmurdo think long and deeply over the commission which have be so suddenly place in his hand the isolated house in which chester wilcox live be about five mile off in an adjacent valley that very night he start off all alone to prepare for the attempt it be daylight before he return from his reconnaissance next day he interview his two subordinate manders and reilly reckless youngster who be as elated as if it be deer hunt two night later they meet outside the town all three armed and one of they carry sack stuff with the powder which be use in the quarry it be two in the morning before they come to the lonely house the night be windy one with broken cloud drift swiftly across the face of three quarter moon they have be warn to be on their guard against bloodhound so they move forward cautiously with their pistol cock in their hand but there be no sound save the howling of the wind and no movement but the sway branch above they mcmurdo listen at the door of the lonely house but all be still within then he lean the powder bag against it rip hole in it with his knife and attach the fuse when it be well alight he and his two companion take to their heel and be some distance off safe and snug in shelter ditch before the shatter roar of the explosion with the low deep rumble of the collapse building tell they that their work be do no clean job have ever be carry out in the bloodstaine annal of the society but alas that work so well organized and boldly carry out should all have go for nothing warn by the fate of the various victim and know that he be mark down for destruction chester wilcox have move himself and his family only the day before to some safe and less know quarter where guard of police should watch over they it be an empty house which have be tear down by the gunpowder and the grim old colour sergeant of the war be still teach discipline to the miner of iron dike "leave he to i say mcmurdo he be my man and 'll get he sure if have to wait year for he "a vote of thank and confidence be pass in full lodge and so for the time the matter end when few week later it be report in the paper that wilcox have be shoot at from an ambuscade it be an open secret that mcmurdo be still at work upon his unfinished job such be the method of the society of freemen and such be the deed of the scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over the great and rich district which be for so long period haunt by their terrible presence why should these page be stain by further crime have not say enough to show the man and their methods?these deed be write in history and there be record wherein one may read the detail of they there one may learn of the shooting of policemen hunt and evans because they have venture to arrest two member of the society double outrage plan at the vermissa lodge and carry out in cold blood upon two helpless and disarm man there also one may read of the shooting of mrs. larbey when she be nurse her husband who have be beat almost to death by order of boss mcginty the killing of the eld jenkins shortly follow by that of his brother the mutilation of james murdoch the blow up of the staphouse family and the murder of the stendal all follow hard upon one another in the same terrible winter darkly the shadow lie upon the valley of fear the spring have come with run brook and blossoming tree there be hope for all nature bind so long in an iron grip but nowhere be there any hope for the man and woman who live under the yoke of the terror never have the cloud above they be so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of the year 1875 it be the height of the reign of terror mcmurdo who have already be appoint inner deacon with every prospect of some day succeed mcginty as bodymaster be now so necessary to the council of his comrade that nothing be do without his help and advice the more popular he become however with the freemen the blacker be the scowl which greet he as he pass along the street of vermissa in spite of their terror the citizen be take heart to band themselves together against their oppressor rumours have reach the lodge of secret gathering in the herald office and of distribution of firearm among the law abide people but mcginty and his man be undisturbe by such report they be numerous resolute and well armed their opponent be scatter and powerless it would all end as it have do in the past in aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrest so say mcginty mcmurdo and all the bolder spirit it be saturday evening in may. saturday be always the lodge night and mcmurdo be leave his house to attend it when morris the weak brother of the order come to see he his brow be crease with care and his kindly face be draw and haggard "can speak with you freely mr. mcmurdo?""sure ""i ca n't forget that speak my heart to you once and that you keep it to yourself even though the boss himself come to ask you about it ""what else could do if you trust i it be n't that agree with what you say ""i know that well but you be the one that can speak to and be safe 've secret here he put his hand to his breast and it be just burn the life out of i wish it have come to any one of you but i if tell it it will mean murder for sure if do n't it may bring the end of we all god help i but be near out of my wit over it!"mcmurdo look at the man earnestly he be tremble in every limb he pour some whisky into glass and hand it to he that be the physic for the like of you say he now let i hear of it "morris drank and his white face take tinge of colour can tell it to you all in one sentence say he there be detective on our trail "mcmurdo stare at he in astonishment why man you be crazy he say be n't the place full of police and detective and what harm do they ever do us?""no no it be no man of the district as you say we know they and it be little that they can do but you 've hear of pinkerton's?""i've read of some folk of that name ""well you can take it from i you 've no show when they be on your trail it be not take it or miss it government concern it be dead earnest business proposition that be out for result and keep out till by hook or crook it get they if pinkerton man be deep in this business we be all destroy ""we must kill he ""ah it be the first thought that come to you so it will be up at the lodge do n't say to you that it would end in murder?""sure what be murder be n't it common enough in these parts?""it be indeed but it be not for i to point out the man that be to be murder 'd never rest easy again and yet it be our own neck that may be at stake in god 's name what shall do he rock to and fro in his agony of indecision but his word have move mcmurdo deeply it be easy to see that he share the other 's opinion as to the danger and the need for meet it he grip morris 's shoulder and shake he in his earnestness "see here man he cry and he almost screech the word in his excitement you wo n't gain anything by sit keen like an old wife at wake let 's have the fact who be the fellow where be he how do you hear of he why do you come to me?""i come to you for you be the one man that would advise i tell you that have store in the east before come here leave good friend behind i and one of they be in the telegraph service here be letter that have from he yesterday it be this part from the top of the page you can read it yourself "this be what mcmurdo read how be the scowrers get on in your part we read plenty of they in the paper between you and i expect to hear news from you before long five big corporation and the two railroad have take the thing up in dead earnest they mean it and you can bet they 'll get there they be right deep down into it pinkerton have take hold under their order and his good man birdy edwards be operate the thing have get to be stop right now "now read the postscript "of course what give you be what learn in business so it go no far it be queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day and can get no meaning from mcmurdo sit in silence for some time with the letter in his listless hand the mist have lift for moment and there be the abyss before he "does anyone else know of this he ask "i have tell no one else ""but this man your friend have he any other person that he would be likely to write to?""well dare say he know one or two more ""of the lodge?""it 's likely enough ""i be ask because it be likely that he may have give some description of this fellow birdy edwards then we could get on his trail ""well it be possible but should not think he know he he be just tell i the news that come to he by way of business how would he know this pinkerton man?"mcmurdo give violent start "by gar he cry 've get he what fool be not to know it lord but we be in luck we will fix he before he can do any harm see here morris will you leave this thing in my hands?""sure if you will only take it off mine ""i'll do that you can stand right back and let i run it even your name need not be mention 'll take it all on myself as if it be to i that this letter have come will that content you?""it be just what would ask ""then leave it at that and keep your head shut now 'll get down to the lodge and we 'll soon make old man pinkerton sorry for himself ""you would n't kill this man?""the less you know friend morris the easy your conscience will be and the well you will sleep ask no question and let these thing settle themselves have hold of it now "morris shake his head sadly as he leave feel that his blood be on my hand he groan "self protection be no murder anyhow say mcmurdo smile grimly it be he or we guess this man would destroy we all if we leave he long in the valley why brother morris we 'll have to elect you bodymaster yet for you 've surely save the lodge "and yet it be clear from his action that he think more seriously of this new intrusion than his word would show it may have be his guilty conscience it may have be the reputation of the pinkerton organization it may have be the knowledge that great rich corporation have set themselves the task of clear out the scowrers but whatever his reason his action be those of man who be prepare for the bad every paper which would incriminate he be destroy before he leave the house after that he give long sigh of satisfaction for it seem to he that he be safe and yet the danger
