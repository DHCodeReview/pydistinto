it be imperative that now at once while these stupendous event be still clear in my mind should set they down with that exactness of detail which time may blur but even as do so be overwhelmed by the wonder of the fact that it should be our little group of the lost world professor challenger professor summerlee lord john roxton and myself who have pass through this amazing experience when some year ago chronicle in the daily gazette our epoch make journey in south america little think that it should ever fall to my lot to tell an even strange personal experience one which be unique in all human annal and must stand out in the record of history as great peak among the humble foothill which surround it the event itself will always be marvellous but the circumstance that we four be together at the time of this extraordinary episode come about in most natural and indeed inevitable fashion will explain the event which lead up to it as shortly and as clearly as can though be well aware that the full the detail upon such subject the more welcome it will be to the reader for the public curiosity have be and still be insatiable it be upon friday the twenty seventh of august date forever memorable in the history of the world that go down to the office of my paper and ask for three day leave of absence from mr. mcardle who still preside over our news department the good old scotchman shake his head scratch his dwindle fringe of ruddy fluff and finally put his reluctance into word "i be think mr. malone that we could employ you to advantage these day be think there be story that you be the only man that could handle as it should be handle ""i be sorry for that say try to hide my disappointment of course if be need there be an end of the matter but the engagement be important and intimate if could be spare well do n't see that you can "it be bitter but have to put the good face could upon it after all it be my own fault for should have know by this time that journalist have no right to make plan of his own "then 'll think no more of it say with as much cheerfulness as could assume at so short notice what be it that you want i to do?""well it be just to interview that deevil of man down at rotherfield ""you do n't mean professor challenger cry "aye it be just he that do mean he run young alec simpson of the courier mile down the high road last week by the collar of his coat and the slack of his breech you 'll have read of it likely in the police report our boy would as soon interview loose alligator in the zoo but you could do it be think an old friend like you ""why say greatly relieved this make it all easy it so happen that it be to visit professor challenger at rotherfield that be ask for leave of absence the fact be that it be the anniversary of our main adventure on the plateau three year ago and he have ask our whole party down to his house to see he and celebrate the occasion ""capital cry mcardle rub his hand and beam through his glass then you will be able to get his opeenion out of he in any other man would say it be all moonshine but the fellow have make good once and who know but he may again!""get what out of he ask what have he be doing?""haven't you see his letter on scientific possibeelities in to day 's times?""no "mcardle dive down and pick copy from the floor "read it aloud say he indicate column with his finger 'd be glad to hear it again for be not sure now that have the man 's meaning clear in my head "this be the letter which read to the news editor of the gazette scientific possibilities""sir have read with amusement not wholly unmixe with some less complimentary emotion the complacent and wholly fatuous letter of james wilson macphail which have lately appear in your column upon the subject of the blurring of fraunhofer 's line in the spectra both of the planet and of the fix star he dismiss the matter as of no significance to wide intelligence it may well seem of very great possible importance so great as to involve the ultimate welfare of every man woman and child upon this planet can hardly hope by the use of scientific language to convey any sense of my meaning to those ineffectual people who gather their idea from the column of daily newspaper will endeavour therefore to condescend to their limitation and to indicate the situation by the use of homely analogy which will be within the limit of the intelligence of your reader ""man he be wonder living wonder say mcardle shake his head reflectively he 'd put up the feather of sucking dove and set up riot in quakers meeting no wonder he have make london too hot for he it be peety mr. malone for it be grand brain we 'll let 's have the analogy ""we will suppose read that small bundle of connected cork be launch in sluggish current upon voyage across the atlantic the cork drift slowly on from day to day with the same condition all round they if the cork be sentient we could imagine that they would consider these condition to be permanent and assure but we with our superior knowledge know that many thing might happen to surprise the cork they might possibly float up against ship or sleep whale or become entangled in seaweed in any case their voyage would probably end by their be throw up on the rocky coast of labrador but what could they know of all this while they drift so gently day by day in what they think be limitless and homogeneous ocean?"your reader will possibly comprehend that the atlantic in this parable stand for the mighty ocean of ether through which we drift and that the bunch of cork represent the little and obscure planetary system to which we belong third rate sun with its rag tag and bobtail of insignificant satellite we float under the same daily condition towards some unknown end some squalid catastrophe which will overwhelm we at the ultimate confine of space where we be sweep over an etheric niagara or dash upon some unthinkable labrador see no room here for the shallow and ignorant optimism of your correspondent mr. james wilson macphail but many reason why we should watch with very close and interested attention every indication of change in those cosmic surrounding upon which our own ultimate fate may depend ""man he 'd have make grand meenister say mcardle it just boom like an organ let 's get doun to what it be that be trouble he ""the general blurring and shifting of fraunhofer 's line of the spectrum point in my opinion to widespread cosmic change of subtle and singular character light from planet be the reflect light of the sun light from star be self produce light but the spectra both from planet and star have in this instance all undergo the same change be it then change in those planet and star to i such an idea be inconceivable what common change could simultaneously come upon they all be it change in our own atmosphere it be possible but in the high degree improbable since we see no sign of it around we and chemical analysis have fail to reveal it what then be the third possibility that it may be change in the conducting medium in that infinitely fine ether which extend from star to star and pervade the whole universe deep in that ocean we be float upon slow current might that current not drift we into belt of ether which be novel and have property of which we have never conceive there be change somewhere this cosmic disturbance of the spectrum prove it it may be good change it may be an evil one it may be neutral one we do not know shallow observer may treat the matter as one which can be disregard but one who like myself be possess of the deep intelligence of the true philosopher will understand that the possibility of the universe be incalculable and that the wise man be he who hold himself ready for the unexpected to take an obvious example who would undertake to say that the mysterious and universal outbreak of illness record in your column this very morning as having break out among the indigenous race of sumatra have no connection with some cosmic change to which they may respond more quickly than the more complex people of europe throw out the idea for what it be worth to assert it be in the present stage as unprofitable as to deny it but it be an unimaginative numskull who be too dense to perceive that it be well within the bound of scientific possibility "your faithfully george edward challenger."the briars rotherfield.""it 's fine steemulate letter say mcardle thoughtfully fit cigarette into the long glass tube which he use as holder what be your opeenion of it mr. malone?"i have to confess my total and humiliating ignorance of the subject at issue what for example be fraunhofer 's line mcardle have just be study the matter with the aid of our tame scientist at the office and he pick from his desk two of those many coloured spectral band which bear general resemblance to the hat ribbon of some young and ambitious cricket club he point out to i that there be certain black line which form crossbar upon the series of brilliant colour extend from the red at one end through gradation of orange yellow green blue and indigo to the violet at the other "those dark band be fraunhofer 's line say he the colour be just light itself every light if you can split it up with prism give the same colour they tell we nothing it be the line that count because they vary accord to what it may be that produce the light it be these line that have be blur instead of clear this last week and all the astronomer have be quarrel over the reason here be photograph of the blurred line for our issue to morrow the public have take no interest in the matter up to now but this letter of challenger 's in the times will make they wake up be think ""and this about sumatra?""well it be long cry from blurred line in spectrum to sick nigger in sumatra and yet the chiel have show we once before that he know what he be talk about there be some queer illness down yonder that be beyond all doubt and to day there be cable just come in from singapore that the lighthouse be out of action in the straits of sundan and two ship on the beach in consequence anyhow it be good enough for you to interview challenger upon if you get anything definite let we have column by monday "i be come out from the news editor 's room turn over my new mission in my mind when hear my name call from the waiting room below it be telegraph boy with wire which have be forward from my lodging at streatham the message be from the very man we have be discuss and run thus malone 17 hill street streatham bring oxygen challenger "bre oxygen the professor as remember he have an elephantine sense of humour capable of the most clumsy and unwieldly gambolling be this one of those joke which use to reduce he to uproarious laughter when his eye would disappear and he be all gape mouth and wag beard supremely indifferent to the gravity of all around he turn the word over but could make nothing even remotely jocose out of they then surely it be concise order though very strange one he be the last man in the world whose deliberate command should care to disobey possibly some chemical experiment be afoot possibly well it be no business of mine to speculate upon why he want it must get it there be nearly an hour before should catch the train at victoria take taxi and having ascertain the address from the telephone book make for the oxygen tube supply company in oxford street as alight on the pavement at my destination two youth emerge from the door of the establishment carry an iron cylinder which with some trouble they hoist into wait motor car an elderly man be at their heel scold and direct in creaky sardonic voice he turn towards i there be no mistaking those austere feature and that goatee beard it be my old cross grained companion professor summerlee "what he cry do n't tell i thatyouhave have one of these preposterous telegram for oxygen?"i exhibit it "well well have have one too and as you see very much against the grain have act upon it our good friend be as impossible as ever the need for oxygen could not have be so urgent that he must desert the usual mean of supply and encroach upon the time of those who be really busy than himself why could he not order it direct?"i could only suggest that he probably want it at once "or think he do which be quite another matter but it be superfluous now for you to purchase any since have this considerable supply ""still for some reason he seem to wish that should bring oxygen too it will be safe to do exactly what he tell i "accordingly in spite of many grumble and remonstrance from summerlee order an additional tube which be place with the other in his motor car for he have offer i lift to victoria turn away to pay off my taxi the driver of which be very cantankerous and abusive over his fare as come back to professor summerlee he be have furious altercation with the man who have carry down the oxygen his little white goat 's beard jerk with indignation one of the fellow call he remember silly old bleached cockatoo which so enrage his chauffeur that he bound out of his seat to take the part of his insulted master and it be all we could do to prevent riot in the street these little thing may seem trivial to relate and pass as mere incident at the time it be only now as look back that see their relation to the whole story which have to unfold the chauffeur must as it seem to i have be novice or else have lose his nerve in this disturbance for he drive vilely on the way to the station twice we nearly have collision with other equally erratic vehicle and remember remark to summerlee that the standard of drive in london have very much decline once we brush the very edge of great crowd which be watch fight at the corner of the mall the people who be much excited raise cry of anger at the clumsy driving and one fellow spring upon the step and wave stick above our head push he off but we be glad when we have get clear of they and safe out of the park these little event come one after the other leave i very jangle in my nerve and could see from my companion 's petulant manner that his own patience have get to low ebb but our good humour be restore when we see lord john roxton wait for we upon the platform his tall thin figure clothe in yellow tweed shooting suit his keen face with those unforgettable eye so fierce and yet so humorous flush with pleasure at the sight of we his ruddy hair be shoot with grey and the furrow upon his brow have be cut little deep by time 's chisel but in all else he be the lord john who have be our good comrade in the past "hullo herr professor hullo young fella he shout as he come toward we he roar with amusement when he see the oxygen cylinder upon the porter 's trolly behind we so you 've get they too he cry mine be in the van whatever can the old dear be after?""have you see his letter in the times ask "what be it?""stuff and nonsense say summerlee harshly "well it be at the bottom of this oxygen business or be mistaken say i."stuff and nonsense cry summerlee again with quite unnecessary violence we have all get into first class smoker and he have already light the short and char old briar pipe which seem to singe the end of his long aggressive nose "friend challenger be clever man say he with great vehemence no one can deny it it be fool that deny it look at his hat there be sixty ounce brain inside it big engine run smooth and turn out clean work show i the engine house and 'll tell you the size of the engine but he be bear charlatan you 've hear i tell he so to his face bear charlatan with kind of dramatic trick of jump into the limelight thing be quiet so friend challenger see chance to set the public talk about he you do n't imagine that he seriously believe all this nonsense about change in the ether and danger to the human race be ever such cock and bull story in this life?"he sit like an old white raven croak and shake with sardonic laughter wave of anger pass through i as listen to summerlee it be disgraceful that he should speak thus of the leader who have be the source of all our fame and give we such an experience as no man have ever enjoy have open my mouth to utter some hot retort when lord john get before i "you have scrap once before with old man challenger say he sternly and you be down and out inside ten second it seem to i professor summerlee he be beyond your class and the good you can do with he be to walk wide and leave he alone ""besides say he have be good friend to every one of we whatever his fault may be he be as straight as line and do n't believe he ever speak evil of his comrade behind their back ""well say young fellah my lad say lord john roxton then with kindly smile he slap professor summerlee upon his shoulder come herr professor we be not go to quarrel at this time of day we 've see too much together but keep off the grass when you get near challenger for this young fellah and have bit of weakness for the old dear "but summerlee be in no humour for compromise his face be screw up in rigid disapproval and thick curl of angry smoke roll up from his pipe "as to you lord john roxton he creak your opinion upon matter of science be of as much value in my eye as my view upon new type of shot gun would be in yours have my own judgment sir and use it in my own way because it have mislead i once be that any reason why should accept without criticism anything however far fetched which this man may care to put forward be we to have pope of science with infallible decree lay downex cathedra and accept without question by the poor humble public tell you sir that have brain of my own and that should feel myself to be snob and slave if do not use it if it please you to believe this rigmarole about ether and fraunhofer 's line upon the spectrum do so by all mean but do not ask one who be old and wise than yourself to share in your folly be it not evident that if the ether be affect to the degree which he maintain and if it be obnoxious to human health the result of it would already be apparent upon ourselves here he laugh with uproarious triumph over his own argument yes sir we should already be very far from our normal self and instead of sit quietly discuss scientific problem in railway train we should be show actual symptom of the poison which be work within we where do we see any sign of this poisonous cosmic disturbance answer i that sir answer i that come come no evasion pin you to an answer!"i feel more and more angry there be something very irritating and aggressive in summerlee 's demeanour "i think that if you know more about the fact you might be less positive in your opinion say i.summerlee take his pipe from his mouth and fix i with stony stare "pray what do you mean sir by that somewhat impertinent observation?""i mean that when be leave the office the news editor tell i that telegram have come in confirm the general illness of the sumatra native and add that the light have not be light in the straits of sunda ""really there should be some limit to human folly cry summerlee in positive fury be it possible that you do not realize that ether if for moment we adopt challenger 's preposterous supposition be universal substance which be the same here as at the other side of the world do you for an instant suppose that there be an english ether and sumatran ether perhaps you imagine that the ether of kent be in some way superior to the ether of surrey through which this train be now bear we there really be no bound to the credulity and ignorance of the average layman be it conceivable that the ether in sumatra should be so deadly as to cause total insensibility at the very time when the ether here have have no appreciable effect upon we whatever personally can truly say that never feel strong in body or well balance in mind in my life ""that may be do n't profess to be scientific man say though have hear somewhere that the science of one generation be usually the fallacy of the next but it do not take much common sense to see that as we seem to know so little about ether it might be affect by some local condition in various part of the world and might show an effect over there which would only develop later with we ""with might and may you can prove anything cry summerlee furiously pig may fly yes sir pigsmayfly but they do n't it be not worth argue with you challenger have fill you with his nonsense and you be both incapable of reason have as soon lay argument before those railway cushion ""i must say professor summerlee that your manner do not seem to have improve since last have the pleasure of meet you say lord john severely "you lordling be not accustomed to hear the truth summerlee answer with bitter smile it come as bit of shock do it not when someone make you realize that your title leave you none the less very ignorant man?""upon my word sir say lord john very stern and rigid if you be young man you would not dare to speak to i in so offensive fashion "summerlee thrust out his chin with its little wag tuft of goatee beard "i would have you know sir that young or old there have never be time in my life when be afraid to speak my mind to an ignorant coxcomb yes sir an ignorant coxcomb if you have as many title as slave could invent and fool could adopt "for moment lord john 's eye blaze and then with tremendous effort he master his anger and lean back in his seat with arm fold and bitter smile upon his face to i all this be dreadful and deplorable like wave the memory of the past sweep over i the good comradeship the happy adventurous day all that we have suffer and work for and win that it should have come to this to insult and abuse suddenly be sob sob in loud gulp uncontrollable sob which refuse to be conceal my companion look at i in surprise cover my face with my hand "it be all right say i. only only it be such pity!""you're ill young
