in the year 1878 take my degree of doctor of medicine of the university of london and proceed to netley to go through the course prescribe for surgeon in the army having complete my study there be duly attach to the fifth northumberland fusiliers as assistant surgeon the regiment be station in india at the time and before could join it the second afghan war have break out on landing at bombay learn that my corps have advance through the pass and be already deep in the enemy 's country follow however with many other officer who be in the same situation as myself and succeed in reach candahar in safety where find my regiment and at once enter upon my new duty the campaign bring honour and promotion to many but for i it have nothing but misfortune and disaster be remove from my brigade and attach to the berkshires with whom serve at the fatal battle of maiwand there be strike on the shoulder by jezail bullet which shatter the bone and graze the subclavian artery should have fall into the hand of the murderous ghazis have it not be for the devotion and courage show by murray my orderly who throw i across pack horse and succeed in bring i safely to the british line wear with pain and weak from the prolong hardship which have undergo be remove with great train of wound sufferer to the base hospital at peshawar here rally and have already improve so far as to be able to walk about the ward and even to bask little upon the verandah when be strike down by enteric fever that curse of our indian possession for month my life be despair of and when at last come to myself and become convalescent be so weak and emaciate that medical board determine that not day should be lose in send i back to england be dispatch accordingly in the troopship orontes and land month later on portsmouth jetty with my health irretrievably ruin but with permission from paternal government to spend the next nine month in attempt to improve it have neither kith nor kin in england and be therefore as free as air or as free as an income of eleven shilling and sixpence day will permit man to be under such circumstance naturally gravitate to london that great cesspool into which all the lounger and idler of the empire be irresistibly drain there stay for some time at private hotel in the strand lead comfortless meaningless existence and spend such money as have considerably more freely than ought so alarming do the state of my finance become that soon realize that must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country or that must make complete alteration in my style of living choose the latter alternative begin by make up my mind to leave the hotel and to take up my quarter in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile on the very day that have come to this conclusion be stand at the criterion bar when some one tap i on the shoulder and turn round recognize young stamford who have be dresser under i at barts the sight of friendly face in the great wilderness of london be pleasant thing indeed to lonely man in old day stamford have never be particular crony of mine but now hail he with enthusiasm and he in his turn appear to be delighted to see i in the exuberance of my joy ask he to lunch with i at the holborn and we start off together in hansom "whatever have you be do with yourself watson he ask in undisguise wonder as we rattle through the crowded london street you be as thin as lath and as brown as nut "i give he short sketch of my adventure and have hardly conclude it by the time that we reach our destination "poor devil he say commiseratingly after he have listen to my misfortune what be you up to now?""looke for lodging answer try to solve the problem as to whether it be possible to get comfortable room at reasonable price ""that be strange thing remark my companion you be the second man to day that have use that expression to i ""and who be the first ask "a fellow who be work at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital he be bemoan himself this morning because he could not get someone to go half with he in some nice room which he have find and which be too much for his purse ""by jove cry if he really want someone to share the room and the expense be the very man for he should prefer have partner to be alone "young stamford look rather strangely at i over his wine glass you do n't know sherlock holmes yet he say perhaps you would not care for he as constant companion ""why what be there against him?""oh do n't say there be anything against he he be little queer in his idea an enthusiast in some branch of science as far as know he be decent fellow enough ""a medical student suppose say i."no have no idea what he intend to go in for believe he be well up in anatomy and he be first class chemist but as far as know he have never take out any systematic medical class his study be very desultory and eccentric but he have amass lot of out of the way knowledge which would astonish his professor ""did you never ask he what he be go in for ask "no he be not man that it be easy to draw out though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seize he ""i should like to meet he say if be to lodge with anyone should prefer man of studious and quiet habit be not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement have enough of both in afghanistan to last i for the remainder of my natural existence how could meet this friend of yours?""he be sure to be at the laboratory return my companion he either avoid the place for week or else he work there from morning to night if you like we shall drive round together after luncheon ""certainly answer and the conversation drift away into other channel as we make our way to the hospital after leave the holborn stamford give i few more particular about the gentleman whom propose to take as fellow lodger "you must n't blame i if you do n't get on with he he say know nothing more of he than have learn from meet he occasionally in the laboratory you propose this arrangement so you must not hold i responsible ""if we do n't get on it will be easy to part company answer it seem to i stamford add look hard at my companion that you have some reason for wash your hand of the matter be this fellow 's temper so formidable or what be it do n't be mealy mouthed about it ""it be not easy to express the inexpressible he answer with laugh holmes be little too scientific for my taste it approach to cold bloodedness could imagine his give friend little pinch of the late vegetable alkaloid not out of malevolence you understand but simply out of spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effect to do he justice think that he would take it himself with the same readiness he appear to have passion for definite and exact knowledge ""very right too ""yes but it may be push to excess when it come to beat the subject in the dissect room with stick it be certainly take rather bizarre shape ""beating the subjects!""yes to verify how far bruise may be produce after death see he at it with my own eye ""and yet you say he be not medical student?""no heaven know what the object of his study be but here we be and you must form your own impression about he as he speak we turn down narrow lane and pass through small side door which open into wing of the great hospital it be familiar ground to i and need no guiding as we ascend the bleak stone staircase and make our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewash wall and dun colour door near the further end low arched passage branch away from it and lead to the chemical laboratory this be lofty chamber line and litter with countless bottle broad low table be scatter about which bristle with retort test tube and little bunsen lamp with their blue flickering flame there be only one student in the room who be bend over distant table absorb in his work at the sound of our step he glance round and spring to his foot with cry of pleasure 've find it 've find it he shout to my companion run towards we with test tube in his hand have find re agent which be precipitate by hoemoglobin and by nothing else have he discover gold mine great delight could not have shine upon his feature "dr watson mr. sherlock holmes say stamford introduce we "how be you he say cordially grip my hand with strength for which should hardly have give he credit you have be in afghanistan perceive ""how on earth do you know that ask in astonishment "never mind say he chuckle to himself the question now be about hoemoglobin no doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?""it be interesting chemically no doubt answer but practically why man it be the most practical medico legal discovery for year do n't you see that it give we an infallible test for blood stain come over here now he seize i by the coat sleeve in his eagerness and draw i over to the table at which he have be work let we have some fresh blood he say dig long bodkin into his finger and draw off the result drop of blood in chemical pipette now add this small quantity of blood to litre of water you perceive that the result mixture have the appearance of pure water the proportion of blood can not be more than one in million have no doubt however that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction as he speak he throw into the vessel few white crystal and then add some drop of transparent fluid in an instant the content assume dull mahogany colour and brownish dust be precipitate to the bottom of the glass jar "ha ha he cry clap his hand and look as delighted as child with new toy what do you think of that?""it seem to be very delicate test remark "beautiful beautiful the old guiacum test be very clumsy and uncertain so be the microscopic examination for blood corpuscle the latter be valueless if the stain be few hour old now this appear to act as well whether the blood be old or new have this test be invent there be hundred of man now walk the earth who would long ago have pay the penalty of their crime ""indeed murmur "criminal case be continually hinge upon that one point man be suspect of crime month perhaps after it have be commit his linen or clothe be examine and brownish stain discover upon they be they blood stain or mud stain or rust stain or fruit stain or what be they that be question which have puzzle many an expert and why because there be no reliable test now we have the sherlock holmes test and there will no long be any difficulty "his eye fairly glitter as he speak and he put his hand over his heart and bow as if to some applaud crowd conjure up by his imagination "you be to be congratulate remark considerably surprised at his enthusiasm "there be the case of von bischoff at frankfort last year he would certainly have be hang have this test be in existence then there be mason of bradford and the notorious muller and lefevre of montpellier and samson of new orleans could name score of case in which it would have be decisive ""you seem to be walk calendar of crime say stamford with laugh you might start paper on those line call it the police news of the past '""very interesting reading it might be make too remark sherlock holmes stick small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger have to be careful he continue turn to i with smile for dabble with poison good deal he hold out his hand as he speak and notice that it be all mottle over with similar piece of plaster and discolour with strong acid "we come here on business say stamford sit down on high three legged stool and push another one in my direction with his foot my friend here want to take digging and as you be complain that you could get no one to go half with you think that have well bring you together "sherlock holmes seem delighted at the idea of share his room with i have my eye on suite in baker street he say which would suit we down to the ground you do n't mind the smell of strong tobacco hope?""i always smoke ship 's myself answer "that be good enough generally have chemical about and occasionally do experiment would that annoy you?""by no mean ""let i see what be my other shortcoming get in the dump at time and do n't open my mouth for day on end you must not think be sulky when do that just let i alone and 'll soon be right what have you to confess now it be just as well for two fellow to know the bad of one another before they begin to live together "i laugh at this cross examination keep bull pup say and object to row because my nerve be shake and get up at all sort of ungodly hour and be extremely lazy have another set of vice when be well but those be the principal one at present ""do you include violin playing in your category of row he ask anxiously "it depend on the player answer well play violin be treat for the god badly play one oh that be all right he cry with merry laugh think we may consider the thing as settle that is if the room be agreeable to you ""when shall we see them?""call for i here at noon to morrow and we 'll go together and settle everything he answer "all right noon exactly say shake his hand we leave he work among his chemical and we walk together towards my hotel "by the way ask suddenly stop and turn upon stamford how the deuce do he know that have come from afghanistan?"my companion smile an enigmatical smile that be just his little peculiarity he say good many people have want to know how he find thing out ""oh mystery be it cry rub my hand this be very piquant be much oblige to you for bring we together the proper study of mankind be man you know ""you must study he then stamford say as he bid i good bye you 'll find he knotty problem though 'll wager he learn more about you than you about he good bye ""good bye answer and stroll on to my hotel considerably interested in my new acquaintance we meet next day as he have arrange and inspect the room at no 221b baker street of which he have speak at our meeting they consist of couple of comfortable bed room and single large airy sitting room cheerfully furnish and illuminate by two broad window so desirable in every way be the apartment and so moderate do the term seem when divide between we that the bargain be conclude upon the spot and we at once enter into possession that very evening move my thing round from the hotel and on the following morning sherlock holmes follow i with several box and portmanteaus for day or two we be busily employ in unpack and lay out our property to the good advantage that do we gradually begin to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surrounding holmes be certainly not difficult man to live with he be quiet in his way and his habit be regular it be rare for he to be up after ten at night and he have invariably breakfast and go out before rise in the morning sometimes he spend his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissecting room and occasionally in long walk which appear to take he into the low portion of the city nothing could exceed his energy when the work fit be upon he but now and again reaction would seize he and for day on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting room hardly utter word or move muscle from morning to night on these occasion have notice such dreamy vacant expression in his eye that might have suspect he of be addict to the use of some narcotic have not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbid such notion as the week go by my interest in he and my curiosity as to his aim in life gradually deepen and increase his very person and appearance be such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer in height he be rather over six foot and so excessively lean that he seem to be considerably tall his eye be sharp and pierce save during those interval of torpor to which have allude and his thin hawk like nose give his whole expression an air of alertness and decision his chin too have the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination his hand be invariably blot with ink and stain with chemical yet he be possess of extraordinary delicacy of touch as frequently have occasion to observe when watch he manipulate his fragile philosophical instrument the reader may set i down as hopeless busybody when confess how much this man stimulate my curiosity and how often endeavour to break through the reticence which he show on all that concern himself before pronounce judgment however be it remember how objectless be my life and how little there be to engage my attention my health forbid i from venture out unless the weather be exceptionally genial and have no friend who would call upon i and break the monotony of my daily existence under these circumstance eagerly hail the little mystery which hang around my companion and spend much of my time in endeavour to unravel it he be not study medicine he have himself in reply to question confirm stamford 's opinion upon that point neither do he appear to have pursue any course of reading which might fit he for degree in science or any other recognize portal which would give he an entrance into the learned world yet his zeal for certain study be remarkable and within eccentric limit his knowledge be so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observation have fairly astound i surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he have some definite end in view desultory reader be seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning no man burden his mind with small matter unless he have some very good reason for do so his ignorance be as remarkable as his knowledge of contemporary literature philosophy and politic he appear to know next to nothing upon my quote thomas carlyle he inquire in the naivest way who he might be and what he have do my surprise reach climax however when find incidentally that he be ignorant of the copernican theory and of the composition of the solar system that any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travel round the sun appear to be to i such an extraordinary fact that could hardly realize it "you appear to be astonish he say smile at my expression of surprise now that do know it shall do my good to forget it ""to forget it!""you see he explain consider that man 's brain originally be like little empty attic and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose fool take in all the lumber of every sort that he come across so that the knowledge which might be useful to he gets crowd out or at good be jumble up with lot of other thing so that he have difficulty in lay his hand upon it now the skilful workman be very careful indeed as to what he take into his brain attic he will have nothing but the tool which may help he in do his work but of these he have large assortment and all in the most perfect order it be mistake to think that that little room have elastic wall and can distend to any extent depend upon it there come time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you know before it be of the high importance therefore not to have useless fact elbow out the useful one ""but the solar system protest "what the deuce be it to i he interrupt impatiently you say that we go round the sun if we go round the moon it would not make pennyworth of difference to i or to my work "i be on the point of ask he what that work might be but something in his manner show i that the question would be an unwelcome one ponder over our short conversation however and endeavour to draw my deduction from it he say that he would acquire no knowledge which do not bear upon his object therefore all the knowledge which he possess be such as would be useful to he enumerate in my own mind all the various point upon which he have show i that he be exceptionally well inform even take pencil and jot they down could not help smile at the document when have complete it it run in this way sherlock holmes his limit knowledge of literature nil philosophy nil astronomy nil politic feeble botany variable well up in belladonna opium and poison generally know nothing of practical gardening geology practical but limited tell at glance different soil from each other after walk have show i splash upon his trouser and tell i by their colour and consistence in what part of london he have receive they chemistry profound anatomy accurate but unsystematic sensational literature immense he appear to know every detail of every horror perpetrate in the century 10 play the violin well 11 be an expert singlestick player boxer and swordsman 12 have good practical knowledge of british law when have get so far in my list throw it into the fire in despair if can only find what the fellow be drive at by reconcile all these accomplishment and discover calling which need they all say to myself may as well give up the attempt at once "i see that have allude above to his power upon the violin these be very remarkable but as eccentric as all his other accomplishment that he could play piece and difficult piece know well because at my request he have play i some of mendelssohn 's lieder and other favourite when leave to himself however he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognize air lean back in his arm chair of an evening he would close his eye and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which be throw across his knee sometimes the chord be sonorous and
