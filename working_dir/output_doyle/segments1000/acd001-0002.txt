be nothing new under the sun it have all be do before "as he speak his nimble finger be fly here there and everywhere feel press unbutton examine while his eye wear the same far away expression which have already remark upon so swiftly be the examination make that one would hardly have guess the minuteness with which it be conduct finally he sniff the dead man 's lip and then glance at the sol of his patent leather boot "he have not be move at all he ask "no more than be necessary for the purpose of our examination ""you can take he to the mortuary now he say there be nothing more to be learn "gregson have stretcher and four man at hand at his call they enter the room and the stranger be lift and carry out as they raise he ring tinkle down and roll across the floor lestrade grab it up and stare at it with mystify eye "there be be woman here he cry it be woman 's wedding ring "he hold it out as he speak upon the palm of his hand we all gather round he and gaze at it there could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold have once adorn the finger of bride "this complicate matter say gregson heaven know they be complicate enough before ""you're sure it do n't simplify they observe holmes there be nothing to be learn by stare at it what do you find in his pockets?""we have it all here say gregson point to litter of object upon one of the bottom step of the stair gold watch no

refer to the sailing of their boat from liverpool it be clear that this unfortunate man be about to return to new york ""have you make any inquiry as to this man stangerson?""i do it at once sir say gregson have have advertisement send to all the newspaper and one of my man have go to the american exchange but he have not return yet ""have you send to cleveland?""we telegraph this morning ""how do you word your inquiries?""we simply detail the circumstance and say that we should be glad of any information which could help we ""you do not ask for particular on any point which appear to you to be crucial?""i ask about stangerson ""nothing else be there no circumstance on which this whole case appear to hinge will you not telegraph again?""i have say all have to say say gregson in an offended voice sherlock holmes chuckle to himself and appear to be about to make some remark when lestrade who have be in the front room while we be hold this conversation in the hall reappear upon the scene rub his hand in pompous and self satisfied manner "mr gregson he say have just make discovery of the high importance and one which would have be overlook have not make careful examination of the wall "the little man 's eye sparkle as he speak and he be evidently in state of suppress exultation at having score point against his colleague "come here he say bustle back into the room the atmosphere of which feel clear since the removal of its ghastly inmate now stand there!"he strike match on his boot and hold it up against the wall "look at that he say triumphantly have remark that the paper have fall away in part in this particular corner of the room large piece have peel off leave yellow square of coarse plastering across this bare space there be scrawl in blood red letter single word rache."what do you think of that cry the detective with the air of showman exhibit his show this be overlook because it be in the dark corner of the room and no one thought of look there the murderer have write it with his or her own blood see this smear where it have trickle down the wall that dispose of the idea of suicide anyhow why be that corner choose to write it on will tell you see that candle on the mantelpiece it be light at the time and if it be light this corner would be the bright instead of the dark portion of the wall ""and what do it mean now that youhavefound it ask gregson in depreciatory voice "mean why it mean that the writer be go to put the female name rachel but be disturb before he or she have time to finish you mark my word when this case come to be clear up you will find that woman name rachel have something to do with it it be all very well for you to laugh mr. sherlock holmes you may be very smart and clever but the old hound be the good when all be say and do ""i really beg your pardon say my companion who have ruffle the little man 's temper by burst into an explosion of laughter you certainly have the credit of be the first of we to find this out and as you say it bear every mark of having be write by the other participant in last night 's mystery have not have time to examine this room yet but with your permission shall do so now "as he speak he whip tape measure and large round magnifying glass from his pocket with these two implement he trot noiselessly about the room sometimes stop occasionally kneel and once lie flat upon his face so engross be he with his occupation that he appear to have forget our presence for he chatter away to himself under his breath the whole time keep up run fire of exclamation groan whistle and little cry suggestive of encouragement and of hope as watch he be irresistibly remind of pure blooded well train foxhound as it dash backwards and forwards through the covert whine in its eagerness until it come across the lost scent for twenty minute or more he continue his research measure with the most exact care the distance between mark which be entirely invisible to i and occasionally apply his tape to the wall in an equally incomprehensible manner in one place he gather up very carefully little pile of grey dust from the floor and pack it away in an envelope finally he examine with his glass the word upon the wall go over every letter of it with the most minute exactness this do he appear to be satisfied for he replace his tape and his glass in his pocket "they say that genius be an infinite capacity for take pain he remark with smile it be very bad definition but it do apply to detective work "gregson and lestrade have watch the manoeuvre of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt they evidently fail to appreciate the fact which have begin to realize that sherlock holmes small action be all direct towards some definite and practical end "what do you think of it sir they both ask "it would be rob you of the credit of the case if be to presume to help you remark my friend you be do so well now that it would be pity for anyone to interfere there be world of sarcasm in his voice as he speak if you will let i know how your investigation go he continue shall be happy to give you any help can in the meantime should like to speak to the constable who find the body can you give i his name and address?"lestrade glance at his note book john rance he say he be off duty now you will find he at 46 audley court kennington park gate "holme take note of the address "come along doctor he say we shall go and look he up 'll tell you one thing which may help you in the case he continue turn to the two detective there have be murder do and the murderer be man he be more than six foot high be in the prime of life have small foot for his height wear coarse square toe boot and smoke trichinopoly cigar he come here with his victim in four wheel cab which be draw by horse with three old shoe and one new one on his off fore leg in all probability the murderer have florid face and the finger nail of his right hand be remarkably long these be only few indication but they may assist you "lestrade and gregson glance at each other with an incredulous smile "if this man be murder how be it do ask the former "poison say sherlock holmes curtly and strode off one other thing lestrade he add turn round at the door rache be the german for revenge so do n't lose your time look for miss rachel "with which parthian shoot he walk away leave the two rival open mouthed behind he it be one o'clock when we leave no lauriston gardens sherlock holmes lead i to the near telegraph office whence he dispatch long telegram he then hail cab and order the driver to take we to the address give we by lestrade "there be nothing like first hand evidence he remark as matter of fact my mind be entirely make up upon the case but still we may as well learn all that be to be learn ""you amaze i holmes say i. surely you be not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particular which you give ""there be no room for mistake he answer the very first thing which observe on arrive there be that cab have make two rut with its wheel close to the curb now up to last night we have have no rain for week so that those wheel which leave such deep impression must have be there during the night there be the mark of the horse 's hoofs too the outline of one of which be far more clearly cut than that of the other three show that that be new shoe since the cab be there after the rain begin and be not there at any time during the morning have gregson 's word for that it follow that it must have be there during the night and therefore that it bring those two individual to the house ""that seem simple enough say but how about the other man 's height?""why the height of man in nine case out of ten can be tell from the length of his stride it be simple calculation enough though there be no use my boring you with figure have this fellow 's stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within then have way of check my calculation when man write on wall his instinct lead he to write about the level of his own eye now that writing be just over six foot from the ground it be child 's play ""and his age ask "well if man can stride four and half foot without the small effort he ca n't be quite in the sere and yellow that be the breadth of puddle on the garden walk which he have evidently walk across patent leather boot have go round and square toe have hop over there be no mystery about it at all be simply apply to ordinary life few of those precept of observation and deduction which advocate in that article be there anything else that puzzle you?""the finger nail and the trichinopoly suggest "the write on the wall be do with man 's forefinger dip in blood my glass allow i to observe that the plaster be slightly scratch in do it which would not have be the case if the man 's nail have be trim gather up some scatter ash from the floor it be dark in colour and flakey such an ash as be only make by trichinopoly have make special study of cigar ashe in fact have write monograph upon the subject flatter myself that can distinguish at glance the ash of any know brand either of cigar or of tobacco it be just in such detail that the skilled detective differ from the gregson and lestrade type ""and the florid face ask "ah that be more daring shot though have no doubt that be right you must not ask i that at the present state of the affair "i pass my hand over my brow my head be in whirl remark the more one think of it the more mysterious it grow how come these two man if there be two man into an empty house what have become of the cabman who drive they how could one man compel another to take poison where do the blood come from what be the object of the murderer since robbery have no part in it how come the woman 's ring there above all why should the second man write up the german word rache before decamp confess that can not see any possible way of reconcile all these fact "my companion smile approvingly "you sum up the difficulty of the situation succinctly and well he say there be much that be still obscure though have quite make up my mind on the main fact as to poor lestrade 's discovery it be simply blind intend to put the police upon wrong track by suggest socialism and secret society it be not do by german the if you notice be print somewhat after the german fashion now real german invariably print in the latin character so that we may safely say that this be not write by one but by clumsy imitator who overdo his part it be simply ruse to divert inquiry into wrong channel be not go to tell you much more of the case doctor you know conjuror get no credit when once he have explain his trick and if show you too much of my method of work you will come to the conclusion that be very ordinary individual after all ""i shall never do that answer you have bring detection as near an exact science as it ever will be bring in this world "my companion flush up with pleasure at my word and the earnest way in which utter they have already observe that he be as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty "i'll tell you one other thing he say patent leather 10 and square toe come in the same cab and they walk down the pathway together as friendly as possible arm in arm in all probability when they get inside they walk up and down the room or rather patent leather stand still while square toe walk up and down could read all that in the dust and could read that as he walk he grow more and more excited that be show by the increase length of his stride he be talk all the while and work himself up no doubt into fury then the tragedy occur 've tell you all know myself now for the rest be mere surmise and conjecture we have good working basis however on which to start we must hurry up for want to go to halle 's concert to hear norman neruda this afternoon "this conversation have occur while our cab have be thread its way through long succession of dingy street and dreary by way in the dingy and dreariest of they our driver suddenly come to stand that be audley court in there he say point to narrow slit in the line of dead coloured brick you 'll find i here when you come back "audley court be not an attractive locality the narrow passage lead we into quadrangle pave with flag and line by sordid dwelling we pick our way among group of dirty child and through line of discolour linen until we come to number 46 the door of which be decorate with small slip of brass on which the name rance be engrave on enquiry we find that the constable be in bed and we be show into little front parlour to await his coming he appear presently look little irritable at be disturb in his slumber make my report at the office he say holme take half sovereign from his pocket and play with it pensively we think that we should like to hear it all from your own lip he say "i shall be most happy to tell you anything can the constable answer with his eye upon the little golden disk "just let we hear it all in your own way as it occur "rance sit down on the horsehair sofa and knit his brow as though determine not to omit anything in his narrative "i'll tell it ye from the beginning he say my time be from ten at night to six in the morning at eleven there be fight at the white hart but bar that all be quiet enough on the beat at one o'clock it begin to rain and meet harry murcher he who have the holland grove beat and we stand together at the corner of henrietta street talkin presently maybe about two or little after think would take look round and see that all be right down the brixton road it be precious dirty and lonely not soul do meet all the way down though cab or two go past i be strollin down thinkin between ourselves how uncommon handy four of gin hot would be when suddenly the glint of light catch my eye in the window of that same house now know that they two house in lauriston gardens be empty on account of he that own they who wo n't have the drain see to though the very last tenant what live in one of they die typhoid fever be knock all in heap therefore at see light in the window and suspect as something be wrong when get to the door you stop and then walk back to the garden gate my companion interrupt what do you do that for?"rance give violent jump and stare at sherlock holmes with the utmost amazement upon his feature "why that be true sir he say though how you come to know it heaven only know ye see when get up to the door it be so still and so lonesome that think 'd be none the bad for some one with i ai n't afeare of anything on this side the grave but think that maybe it be he that die the typhoid inspect the drain what kill he the thought give i kind turn and walk back to the gate to see if could see murcher 's lantern but there be n't no sign of he nor of anyone else ""there be no one in the street?""not livin soul sir nor as much as dog then pull myself together and go back and push the door open all be quiet inside so go into the room where the light be burnin there be candle flickerin on the mantelpiece red wax one and by its light see yes know all that you see you walk round the room several time and you knelt down by the body and then you walk through and try the kitchen door and then john rance spring to his foot with frightened face and suspicion in his eye where be you hide to see all that he cry it seem to i that you know deal more than you should "holme laugh and throw his card across the table to the constable do n't get arrest i for the murder he say be one of the hound and not the wolf mr. gregson or mr. lestrade will answer for that go on though what do you do next?"rance resume his seat without however lose his mystified expression go back to the gate and sound my whistle that bring murcher and two more to the spot ""was the street empty then?""well it be as far as anybody that could be of any good go ""what do you mean?"the constable 's feature broaden into grin 've see many drunk chap in my time he say but never anyone so cryin drunk as that cove he be at the gate when come out leanin up agin the railing and singin at the pitch his lung about columbine 's new fangle banner or some such stuff he could n't stand far less help ""what sort of man be he ask sherlock holmes john rance appear to be somewhat irritated at this digression he be an uncommon drunk sort man he say he 'd ha find hisself in the station if we have n't be so take up ""his face his dress do n't you notice they holme break in impatiently "i should think do notice they see that have to prop he up i and murcher between we he be long chap with red face the low part muffle round that will do cry holmes what become of him?""we'd enough to do without lookin after he the policeman say in an aggrieved voice 'll wager he find his way home all right ""how be he dressed?""a brown overcoat ""had he whip in his hand?""a whip no ""he must have leave it behind mutter my companion you do n't happen to see or hear cab after that?""no ""there be half sovereign for you my companion say stand up and take his hat be afraid rance that you will never rise in the force that head of yours should be for use as well as ornament you might have gain your sergeant 's stripe last night the man whom you hold in your hand be the man who hold the clue of this mystery and whom we be seek there be no use of argue about it now tell you that it be so come along doctor "we start off for the cab together leave our informant incredulous but obviously uncomfortable "the blunder fool holme say bitterly as we drive back to our lodging just to think of his have such an incomparable bit of good luck and not take advantage of it ""i be rather in the dark still it be true that the description of this man tally with your idea of the second party in this mystery but why should he come back to the house after leave it that be not the way of criminal ""the ring man the ring that be what he come back for if we have no other way of catch he we can always bait our line with the ring shall have he doctor 'll lay you two to one that have he must thank you for it all might not have go but for you and so have miss the fine study ever come across study in scarlet eh why should n't we use little art jargon there be the scarlet thread of murder run through the colourless skein of life and our duty be to unravel it and isolate it and expose every inch of it and
