for to express an unorthodox opinion be dangerous matter in those day in the land of the saints yes dangerous matter so dangerous that even the most saintly dare only whisper their religious opinion with bated breath lest something which fall from their lip might be misconstrue and bring down swift retribution upon they the victim of persecution have now turn persecutor on their own account and persecutor of the most terrible description not the inquisition of seville nor the german vehm gericht nor the secret societies of italy be ever able to put more formidable machinery in motion than

noiseless who flit by they in the darkness these tale and rumour take substance and shape and be corroborate and re corroborated until they resolve themselves into definite name to this day in the lonely ranch of the west the name of the danite band or the avenging angels be sinister and an ill omen one full knowledge of the organization which produce such terrible result serve to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspire in the mind of man none know who belong to this ruthless society the name of the participator in the deed of blood and violence do under the name of religion be keep profoundly secret the very friend to whom you communicate your misgiving as to the prophet and his mission might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact terrible reparation hence every man fear his neighbour and none speak of the thing which be near his heart one fine morning john ferrier be about to set out to his wheatfield when he hear the click of the latch and look through the window see stout sandy haired middle aged man come up the pathway his heart leap to his mouth for this be none other than the great brigham young himself full
