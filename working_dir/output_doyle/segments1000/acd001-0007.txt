he any known danger he could face with firm lip but this suspense be unnerving he conceal his fear from his daughter however and affect to make light of the whole matter though she with the keen eye of love see plainly that he be ill at ease he expect that he would receive some message or remonstrance from young as to his conduct and he be not mistaken though it come in an unlooked for manner upon rise next morning he find to his surprise small square of paper pin on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest on it be print in bold straggling letter twenty nine day be give you for amendment and then the dash be more fear inspiring than any threat could have be how this warning come into his room puzzle john ferrier sorely for his servant sleep in an outhouse and the door and window have all be secure he crumple the paper up and say nothing to his daughter but the incident strike chill into his heart the twenty nine day be evidently the balance of the month which young have promise what strength or courage could avail against an enemy arm with such mysterious power the hand which fasten that pin might have strike he to the heart and he could never have know who have slay he still more shake be he next morning they have sit down to their breakfast when lucy with cry of surprise point upwards in the centre of the ceiling be scrawl with burn stick apparently the number 28 to his daughter it be unintelligible and he do not enlighten she that night he sit up with his gun and keep watch and ward he see and he hear nothing and yet in the morning great 27 have be paint upon the outside of his door thus day follow day and as sure as morning come he find that his unseen enemy have keep their register and have mark up in some conspicuous position how many day be still leave to he out of the month of grace sometimes the fatal number appear upon the wall sometimes upon the floor occasionally they be on small placard stick upon the garden gate or the railing with all his vigilance john ferrier could not discover whence these daily warning proceed horror which be almost superstitious come upon he at the sight of they he become haggard and restless and his eye have the troubled look of some hunted creature he have but one hope in life now and that be for the arrival of the young hunter from nevada twenty have change to fifteen and fifteen to ten but there be no news of the absentee one by one the number dwindle down and still there come no sign of he whenever horseman clatter down the road or driver shout at his team the old farmer hurry to the gate thinking that help have arrive at last at last when he see five give way to four and that again to three he lose heart and abandon all hope of escape single handed and with his limited knowledge of the mountain which surround the settlement he know that he be powerless the more frequent road be strictly watch and guard and none could pass along they without an order from the council turn which way he would there appear to be no avoid the blow which hang over he yet the old man never waver in his resolution to part with life itself before he consent to what he regard as his daughter 's dishonour he be sit alone one evening ponder deeply over his trouble and search vainly for some way out of they that morning have show the figure upon the wall of his house and the next day would be the last of the allot time what be to happen then all manner of vague and terrible fancy fill his imagination and his daughter what be to become of she after he be go be there no escape from the invisible network which be draw all round they he sink his head upon the table and sob at the thought of his own impotence what be that in the silence he hear gentle scratching sound low but very distinct in the quiet of the night it come from the door of the house ferrier creep into the hall and listen intently there be pause for few moment and then the low insidious sound be repeat someone be evidently tap very gently upon one of the panel of the door be it some midnight assassin who have come to carry out the murderous order of the secret tribunal or be it some agent who be mark up that the last day of grace have arrive john ferrier feel that instant death would be well than the suspense which shake his nerve and chill his heart spring forward he draw the bolt and throw the door open outside all be calm and quiet the night be fine and the star be twinkle brightly overhead the little front garden lie before the farmer 's eye bound by the fence and gate but neither there nor on the road be any human being to be see with sigh of relief ferrier look to right and to left until happen to glance straight down at his own foot he see to his astonishment man lie flat upon his face upon the ground with arm and leg all asprawl so unnerved be he at the sight that he lean up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out his first thought be that the prostrate figure be that of some wounded or die man but as he watch it he see it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of serpent once within the house the man spring to his foot close the door and reveal to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of jefferson hope "good god gasp john ferrier how you scare i whatever make you come in like that ""give i food the other say hoarsely have have no time for bite or sup for eight and forty hour he fling himself upon the 21 cold meat and bread which be still lie upon the table from his host 's supper and devour it voraciously do lucy bear up well he ask when he have satisfy his hunger "yes she do not know the danger her father answer "that be well the house be watch on every side that be why crawl my way up to it they may be darn sharp but they be not quite sharp enough to catch washoe hunter "john ferrier feel different man now that he realize that he have devoted ally he seize the young man 's leathery hand and wring it cordially you be man to be proud of he say there be not many who would come to share our danger and our trouble ""you've hit it there pard the young hunter answer have respect for you but if you be alone in this business 'd think twice before put my head into such hornet 's nest it be lucy that bring i here and before harm come on she guess there will be one less the hope family in utah ""what be we to do?""to morrow be your last day and unless you act to night you be lose have mule and two horse wait in the eagle ravine how much money have you?""two thousand dollar in gold and five in note ""that will do have as much more to add to it we must push for carson city through the mountain you have good wake lucy it be as well that the servant do not sleep in the house "while ferrier be absent prepare his daughter for the approach journey jefferson hope pack all the eatable that he could find into small parcel and fill stoneware jar with water for he know by experience that the mountain well be few and far between he have hardly complete his arrangement before the farmer return with his daughter all dress and ready for start the greeting between the lover be warm but brief for minute be precious and there be much to be do "we must make our start at once say jefferson hope speak in low but resolute voice like one who realize the greatness of the peril but have steel his heart to meet it the front and back entrance be watch but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the field once on the road we be only two mile from the ravine where the horse be wait by daybreak we should be half way through the mountain ""what if we be stop ask ferrier hope slap the revolver butt which protrude from the front of his tunic if they be too many for we we shall take two or three of they with we he say with sinister smile the light inside the house have all be extinguish and from the darken window ferrier peer over the field which have be his own and which he be now about to abandon for ever he have long nerve himself to the sacrifice however and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweigh any regret at his ruin fortune all look so peaceful and happy the rustle tree and the broad silent stretch of grain land that it be difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurk through it all yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter show that in his approach to the house he have see enough to satisfy he upon that head ferrier carry the bag of gold and note jefferson hope have the scanty provision and water while lucy have small bundle contain few of her more value possession open the window very slowly and carefully they wait until dark cloud have somewhat obscure the night and then one by one pass through into the little garden with bated breath and crouch figure they stumble across it and gain the shelter of the hedge which they skirt until they come to the gap which open into the cornfield they have just reach this point when the young man seize his two companion and drag they down into the shadow where they lie silent and tremble it be as well that his prairie training have give jefferson hope the ear of lynx he and his friend have hardly crouch down before the melancholy hooting of mountain owl be hear within few yard of they which be immediately answer by another hoot at small distance at the same moment vague shadowy figure emerge from the gap for which they have be make and utter the plaintive signal cry again on which second man appear out of the obscurity "to morrow at midnight say the first who appear to be in authority when the whip poor will call three time ""it be well return the other shall tell brother drebber?""pass it on to he and from he to the other nine to seven!""seven to five repeat the other and the two figure flit away in different direction their concluding word have evidently be some form of sign and countersign the instant that their footstep have die away in the distance jefferson hope spring to his foot and help his companion through the gap lead the way across the field at the top of his speed support and half carry the girl when her strength appear to fail she "hurry on hurry on he gasp from time to time we be through the line of sentinel everything depend on speed hurry on!"once on the high road they make rapid progress only once do they meet anyone and then they manage to slip into field and so avoid recognition before reach the town the hunter branch away into rugged and narrow footpath which lead to the mountain two dark jagged peak loom above they through the darkness and the defile which lead between they be the eagle cañon in which the horse be await they with unerre instinct jefferson hope pick his way among the great boulder and along the bed of dry up watercourse until he come to the retired corner screen with rock where the faithful animal have be picket the girl be place upon the mule and old ferrier upon one of the horse with his money bag while jefferson hope lead the other along the precipitous and dangerous path it be bewildering route for anyone who be not accustom to face nature in her wild mood on the one side great crag tower up thousand foot or more black stern and menacing with long basaltic column upon its rugged surface like the rib of some petrified monster on the other hand wild chaos of boulder and debris make all advance impossible between the two run the irregular track so narrow in place that they have to travel in indian file and so rough that only practise rider could have traverse it at all yet in spite of all danger and difficulty the heart of the fugitive be light within they for every step increase the distance between they and the terrible despotism from which they be fly they soon have proof however that they be still within the jurisdiction of the saints they have reach the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl give startled cry and point upwards on rock which overlook the track show out dark and plain against the sky there stand solitary sentinel he see they as soon as they perceive he and his military challenge of who go there ring through the silent ravine "traveller for nevada say jefferson hope with his hand upon the rifle which hang by his saddle they could see the lonely watcher finger his gun and peer down at they as if dissatisfy at their reply "by whose permission he ask "the holy four answer ferrier his mormon experience have teach he that that be the high authority to which he could refer "nine from seven cry the sentinel "seven from five return jefferson hope promptly remember the countersign which he have hear in the garden "pass and the lord go with you say the voice from above beyond his post the path broaden out and the horse be able to break into trot look back they could see the solitary watcher lean upon his gun and know that they have pass the outlying post of the choose people and that freedom lie before they all night their course lie through intricate defile and over irregular and rock strew path more than once they lose their way but hope 's intimate knowledge of the mountain enable they to regain the track once more when morning break scene of marvellous though savage beauty lie before they in every direction the great snow cap peak hem they in peep over each other 's shoulder to the far horizon so steep be the rocky bank on either side of they that the larch and the pine seem to be suspend over their head and to need only gust of wind to come hurtle down upon they nor be the fear entirely an illusion for the barren valley be thickly strew with tree and boulder which have fall in similar manner even as they pass great rock came thunder down with hoarse rattle which wake the echo in the silent gorge and startle the weary horse into gallop as the sun rise slowly above the eastern horizon the cap of the great mountain light up one after the other like lamp at festival until they be all ruddy and glowing the magnificent spectacle cheer the heart of the three fugitive and give they fresh energy at wild torrent which sweep out of ravine they call halt and water their horse while they partook of hasty breakfast lucy and her father would fain have rest long but jefferson hope be inexorable they will be upon our track by this time he say everything depend upon our speed once safe in carson we may rest for the remainder of our life "dure the whole of that day they struggle on through the defile and by evening they calculate that they be more than thirty mile from their enemy at night time they choose the base of beetle crag where the rock offer some protection from the chill wind and there huddle together for warmth they enjoy few hour sleep before daybreak however they be up and on their way once more they have see no sign of any pursuer and jefferson hope begin to think that they be fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they have incur he little know how far that iron grasp could reach or how soon it be to close upon they and crush they about the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provision begin to run out this give the hunter little uneasiness however for there be game to be have among the mountain and he have frequently before have to depend upon his rifle for the need of life choose sheltered nook he pile together few dry branch and make blaze fire at which his companion might warm themselves for they be now nearly five thousand foot above the sea level and the air be bitter and keen having tether the horse and bid lucy adieu he throw his gun over his shoulder and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way look back he see the old man and the young girl crouch over the blaze fire while the three animal stand motionless in the back ground then the intervene rock hide they from his view he walk for couple of mile through one ravine after another without success though from the mark upon the bark of the tree and other indication he judge that there be numerous bear in the vicinity at last after two or three hour fruitless search he be think of turn back in despair when cast his eye upwards he see sight which send thrill of pleasure through his heart on the edge of jutting pinnacle three or four hundred foot above he there stand creature somewhat resemble sheep in appearance but arm with pair of gigantic horn the big horn for so it be call be act probably as guardian over flock which be invisible to the hunter but fortunately it be head in the opposite direction and have not perceive he lie on his face he rest his rifle upon rock and take long and steady aim before draw the trigger the animal spring into the air totter for moment upon the edge of the precipice and then came crash down into the valley beneath the creature be too unwieldy to lift so the hunter content himself with cut away one haunch and part of the flank with this trophy over his shoulder he hasten to retrace his step for the evening be already draw in he have hardly start however before he realize the difficulty which face he in his eagerness he have wander far past the ravine which be know to he and it be no easy matter to pick out the path which he have take the valley in
