the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution bring by his own hand upon his enemy his strong will and untire energy should he determine be devoted to that one end with grim white face he retrace his step to where he have drop the food and having stir up the smoulder fire he cook enough to last he for few day this he make up into bundle and tired as he be he set himself to walk back through the mountain upon the track of the avenge angel for five day he toil footsore and weary through the defile which he have already traverse on horseback at night he fling himself down among the rock and snatch few hour of sleep but before daybreak he be always well on his way on the sixth day he reach the eagle ca√±on from which they have commence their ill fate flight thence he could look down upon the home of the saint wear and exhaust he lean upon his rifle and shake his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath he as he look at it he observe that there be flag in some of the principal street and other sign of festivity he be still speculate as to what this might mean when he hear the clatter of horse 's hoofs and see mount man ride towards he as he approach he recognize he as mormon name cowper to whom he have render service at different time he therefore accost he when he get up to he with the object of find out what lucy

while its eye glow with baleful light "where be you going?""never mind he answer and sling his weapon over his shoulder stride off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountain to the haunt of the wild beast amongst they all there be none so fierce and so dangerous as himself the prediction of the mormon be only too well fulfil whether it be the terrible death of her father or the effect of the hateful marriage into which she have be force poor lucy never hold up her head again but pine away and die within month her sottish husband who have marry she principally for the sake of john ferrier 's property do not affect any great grief at his bereavement but his other wife mourn over she and sit up with she the night before the burial as be the mormon custom they be group round

having be bride have disappear for some month jefferson hope linger among the mountain lead strange wild life and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possess he tale be tell in the city of the weird figure which be see prowl about the suburb and which haunt the lonely mountain gorge once bullet whistle through stangerson 's window and flatten itself upon the wall within foot of he on another occasion as drebber pass under cliff great boulder crash down on he and he only escape terrible death by throw himself upon his face the two young mormons be not long in discover the reason of these attempt upon their life and lead repeat expedition into the mountain in the hope of capture or kill their enemy but always without success then they adopt the precaution of never go

vindictiveness far from do so it have if anything augment it the hunter 's mind be of hard unyielde nature and the predominant idea of revenge have take such complete possession of it that there be no room for any other emotion he be however above all thing practical he soon realize that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he be put upon it exposure and want of wholesome food be wear he out if he die like dog among the mountain what be to become of his revenge then and yet such death be sure to overtake he if he persist he feel that that be to play his enemy

assure himself that they be free once more remember that think to myself as eye he that have seldom see more powerfully build man and his dark sunburned face bear an expression of determination and energy which be as formidable as his personal strength "if there be vacant place for chief of the police reckon you be the man for it he say gaze with undisguised admiration at my fellow lodger the way you keep on my trail be caution ""you have well come with i say holmes to the two detective "i can drive you say lestrade "good and gregson can come inside with i you too doctor you have take an interest in the case and may as well stick to we "i assent gladly and we all descend together our prisoner make no attempt at escape but step calmly into the cab which have be his and we follow he

at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which be go on inside the wall of his chest seem to thrill and quiver as frail building would do inside when some powerful engine be at work in the silence of the room could hear dull humming and buzzing noise which proceed from the same source "why cry you have an aortic aneurism!""that be what they call it he say placidly go to doctor last week about it and he tell i that it be bind to burst before many day pass it have be get bad for year get it from over exposure and under feeding among the salt lake mountains 've do my work now and do n't care how soon go but should like to leave some account of the business behind i do n't want to be remember as common cut throat "the inspector and the two detective have hurried discussion as to the advisability of allow he to tell his story "do you consider doctor that there be immediate danger the former ask 24"most certainly there be answer "in that case it be clearly our

calm and methodical manner as though the event which he narrate be commonplace enough can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account for have have access to lestrade 's note book in which the prisoner 's word be take down exactly as they be utter "it do n't much matter to you why hate these man he say it be enough that they be guilty of the death of two human being father and daughter and that they have therefore forfeit their own life after the lapse of time that have pass since their crime it be impossible for i to secure conviction against they in any court know of their guilt though and determine that should be judge jury and executioner all roll into one you 'd have do the same if you have any manhood in you if you have be in my place "that girl that speak of be to have marry i twenty year ago she be force into marry that same drebber and break her heart over it take the marriage ring from her dead finger and vow that his die eye should rest upon that very ring and that his last thought should be of the crime for which he be punish have carry it about with i and have follow he and his accomplice over two continent until catch they they think to tire i out but they could not do it if die to morrow as be likely enough die know that my work in this world be do and well do they have perish and by my hand there be nothing leave for i to hope for or to desire "they be rich and be poor so that it be no easy matter for i to follow they when get to london my pocket be about empty and find that must turn my hand to something for my living drive and riding be as natural to i as walk so apply at cabowner 's office and soon get employment be to bring certain sum week to the owner and whatever be over that might keep for myself there be seldom much over but manage to scrape along somehow the hard job be to learn my way about for reckon that of all the maze that ever be contrive this city be the most confusing have map beside i though and when once have spot the principal hotel and station get on pretty well "it be some time before find out where my two gentleman be live but inquire and inquire until at last drop across they they be at boarding house at camberwell over on the other side of the river when once find they out know that have they at my mercy have grow my beard and there be no chance of their recognize i would dog they and follow they until see my opportunity be determined that they should not escape i again "they be very near do it for all that go where they would about london be always at their heel sometimes follow they on my cab and sometimes on foot but the former be the good for then they could not get away from i it be only early in the morning or late at night that could earn anything so that begin to get behind hand

never go out alone and never after nightfall during two week drive behind they every day and never once see they separate drebber himself be drunk half the time but stangerson be not to be catch nap watch they late and early but never see the ghost of chance but be not discourage for something tell i that the hour have almost come my only fear be that this thing in my chest might burst little too
