at euston station they get out and leave boy to hold my horse and follow they on to the platform hear they ask for the liverpool train and the guard answer that one have just go and there would not be another for some hour stangerson seem to be put out at that but drebber be rather pleased than otherwise get so close to they in the bustle that could hear every word that pass between they drebber say that he have little business of his own to do and that if the other would wait for he he would soon rejoin he his companion remonstrate with he and remind he that they have resolve to stick together drebber answer that the matter be delicate one and that he must go alone could not catch what stangerson say to that but the other burst out swear and remind he that he be nothing more than his pay servant and that he must not presume to dictate to he on that the secretary give it up as bad job and simply bargain with he that if he miss the last train he should rejoin he at halliday 's private hotel to which drebber answer that he would be back on the platform before eleven and make his way out of the station "the moment for which have wait so long have at last come have my enemy within my power together they could protect each other but singly they be at my mercy do not act however with undue precipitation my plan be already form there be no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender have time to realize who it be that strike he and why retribution have come upon he have my plan arrange by which should have the opportunity of make the man who have wrong i understand that his old sin have find he out it chance that some day before gentleman who have be engage in look over some house in the brixton road have drop the key of one of they in my carriage it be claim that same evening and return but in the interval have take moulding of it and have duplicate construct by mean of this have access to at least one spot in this great city where could rely upon be free from interruption how to get drebber to that house be the difficult problem which have now to solve "he walk down the road and go into one or two liquor shop stay for nearly half an hour in the last of they when he come out he stagger in his walk and be evidently pretty well on there be hansom just in front of i and he hail it follow it so close that the nose of my horse be within yard of his driver the whole way we rattle across waterloo bridge and through mile of street until to my astonishment we find ourselves back in the terrace in which he have board could not imagine what his intention be in return there but go on and pull up my cab hundred yard or so from the house he enter it and his hansom drive away give i glass of water if you please my mouth get dry with the talking "i hand he the glass and he drink it down "that be well he say well wait for quarter of an hour or more when suddenly there come noise like people struggle inside the house next moment the door be fling open and two man appear one of whom be drebber and the other be young chap whom have never see before this fellow have drebber by the collar and when they come to the head of the step he give he shove and kick which send he half across the road you hound he cry shake his stick at he 'll teach you to insult an honest girl he be so hot that think he would have thrash drebber with his cudgel only that the cur stagger away down the road as fast as his leg would carry he he run as far as the corner and then see my cab he hail i and jump in drive i to halliday 's private hotel say he "when have he fairly inside my cab my heart jump so with joy that fear lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong drive along slowly weigh in my own mind what it be good to do might take he right out into the country and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with he have almost decide upon this when he solve the problem for i the craze for drink have seize he again and he order i to pull up outside gin palace he go in leave word that should wait for he there he remain until closing time and when he come out he be so far go that know the game be in my own hand "don't imagine that intend to kill he in cold blood it would only have be rigid justice if have do so but could not bring myself to do it have long determine that he should have show for his life if he choose to take advantage of it among the many billet which have fill in america during my wandering life be once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at york college one day the professor be lecture on poision 25 and he show his student some alkaloid as he call it which he have extract from some south american arrow poison and which be so powerful that the least grain mean instant death spot the bottle in which this preparation be keep and when they be all go help myself to little of it be fairly good dispenser so work this alkaloid into small soluble pill and each pill put in box with similar pill make without the poison determine at the time that when have my chance my gentleman should each have draw out of one of these box while eat the pill that remain it would be quite as deadly and good deal less noisy than fire across handkerchief from that day have always my pill box about with i and the time have now come when be to use they "it be near one than twelve and wild bleak night blow hard and rain in torrent dismal as it be outside be glad within so glad that could have shout out from pure exultation if any of you gentleman have ever pine for thing and long for it during twenty long year and then suddenly find it within your reach you would understand my feeling light cigar and puff at it to steady my nerve but my hand be tremble and my temple throb with excitement as drive could see old john ferrier and sweet lucy look at i out of the darkness and smile at i just as plain as see you all in this room all the way they be ahead of i one on each side of the horse until pull up at the house in the brixton road "there be not soul to be see nor sound to be hear except the dripping of the rain when look in at the window find drebber all huddle together in drunken sleep shake he by the arm it be time to get out say "'all right cabby say he "i suppose he think we have come to the hotel that he have mention for he get out without another word and follow i down the garden have to walk beside he to keep he steady for he be still little top heavy when we come to the door open it and lead he into the front room give you my word that all the way the father and the daughter be walk in front of we "'it be infernally dark say he stamp about "'we'll soon have light say strike match and put it to wax candle which have bring with i now enoch drebber continue turn to he and hold the light to my own face who be i?'"he gaze at i with blear drunken eye for moment and then see horror spring up in they and convulse his whole feature which show i that he know i he stagger back with livid face and see the perspiration break out upon his brow while his tooth chatter in his head at the sight lean my back against the door and laugh loud and long have always know that vengeance would be sweet but have never hope for the contentment of soul which now possess i "'you dog say have hunt you from salt lake city to st. petersburg and you have always escape i now at last your wandering have come to an end for either you or shall never see to morrow 's sun rise he shrink still far away as speak and could see on his face that he think be mad so be for the time the pulse in my temple beat like sledge hammer and believe would have have fit of some sort if the blood have not gush from my nose and relieve i "'what do you think of lucy ferrier now cry lock the door and shake the key in his face punishment have be slow in come but it have overtake you at last see his coward lip tremble as speak he would have beg for his life but he know well that it be useless "'would you murder i he stammer "'there be no murder answer who talk of murder mad dog what mercy have you upon my poor darling when you drag she from her slaughter father and bear she away to your accursed and shameless harem '"'it be not who kill her father he cry "'but it be you who break her innocent heart shriek thrust the box before he let the high god judge between we choose and eat there be death in one and life in the other shall take what you leave let we see if there be justice upon the earth or if we be rule by chance '"he cower away with wild cry and prayer for mercy but draw my knife and hold it to his throat until he have obey i then swallow the other and we stand face one another in silence for minute or more wait to see which be to live and which be to die shall ever forget the look which come over his face when the first warning pang tell he that the poison be in his system laugh as see it and hold lucy 's marriage ring in front of his eye it be but for moment for the action of the alkaloid be rapid spasm of pain contort his feature he throw his hand out in front of he stagger and then with hoarse cry fall heavily upon the floor turn he over with my foot and place my hand upon his heart there be no movement he be dead!"the blood have be stream from my nose but have take no notice of it do n't know what it be that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it perhaps it be some mischievous idea of set the police upon wrong track for feel light hearted and cheerful remember german be find in new york with rache write up above he and it be argue at the time in the newspaper that the secret society must have do it guess that what puzzle the new yorkers would puzzle the londoners so dip my finger in my own blood and print it on convenient place on the wall then walk down to my cab and find that there be nobody about and that the night be still very wild have drive some distance when put my hand into the pocket in which usually keep lucy 's ring and find that it be not there be thunderstruck at this for it be the only memento that have of she think that might have drop it when stoop over drebber 's body drive back and leave my cab in side street go boldly up to the house for be ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring when arrive there walk right into the arm of police officer who be come out and only manage to disarm his suspicion by pretend to be hopelessly drunk "that be how enoch drebber come to his end all have to do then be to do as much for stangerson and so pay off john ferrier 's debt know that he be stay at halliday 's private hotel and hang about all day but he never come out 26 fancy that he suspect something when drebber fail to put in an appearance he be cunning be stangerson and always on his guard if he think he could keep i off by stay indoor he be very much mistaken soon find out which be the window of his bedroom and early next morning take advantage of some ladder which be lie in the lane behind the hotel and so make my way into his room in the grey of the dawn wake he up and tell he that the hour have come when he be to answer for the life he have take so long before describe drebber 's death to he and give he the same choice of the poison pill instead of grasp at the chance of safety which that offer he he spring from his bed and fly at my throat in self defence stab he to the heart it would have be the same in any case for providence would never have allow his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison "i have little more to say and it be as well for be about do up go on cabbe it for day or so intend to keep at it until could save enough to take i back to america be stand in the yard when ragged youngster ask if there be cabby there call jefferson hope and say that his cab be want by gentleman at 221b baker street go round suspect no harm and the next thing know this young man here have the bracelet on my wrist and as neatly snackle 27 as ever see in my life that be the whole of my story gentleman you may consider i to be murderer but hold that be just as much an officer of justice as you be "so thrill have the man 's narrative be and his manner be so impressive that we have sit silent and absorb even the professional detective blaséas they be in every detail of crime appear to be keenly interested in the man 's story when he finish we sit for some minute in stillness which be only break by the scratching of lestrade 's pencil as he give the finish touch to his shorthand account "there be only one point on which should like little more information sherlock holmes say at last who be your accomplice who come for the ring which advertised?"the prisoner wink at my friend jocosely can tell my own secret he say but do n't get other people into trouble see your advertisement and think it might be plant or it might be the ring which want my friend volunteer to go and see think you 'll own he do it smartly ""not doubt of that say holmes heartily "now gentleman the inspector remark gravely the form of the law must be comply with on thursday the prisoner will be bring before the magistrate and your attendance will be require until then will be responsible for he he ring the bell as he speak and jefferson hope be lead off by couple of warder while my friend and make our way out of the station and take cab back to baker street we have all be warn to appear before the magistrate upon the thursday but when the thursday come there be no occasion for our testimony high judge have take the matter in hand and jefferson hope have be summon before tribunal where strict justice would be mete out to he on the very night after his capture the aneurism burst and he be find in the morning stretch upon the floor of the cell with placid smile upon his face as though he have be able in his die moment to look back upon useful life and on work well do "gregson and lestrade will be wild about his death holme remark as we chat it over next evening where will their grand advertisement be now?""i do n't see that they have very much to do with his capture answer "what you do in this world be matter of no consequence return my companion bitterly the question be what can you make people believe that you have do never mind he continue more brightly after pause would not have miss the investigation for anything there have be no well case within my recollection simple as it be there be several most instructive point about it ""simple ejaculate "well really it can hardly be describe as otherwise say sherlock holmes smile at my surprise the proof of its intrinsic simplicity be that without any help save few very ordinary deduction be able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three day ""that be true say i."i have already explain to you that what be out of the common be usually guide rather than hindrance in solve problem of this sort the grand thing be to be able to reason backwards that be very useful accomplishment and very easy one but people do not practise it much in the every day affair of life it be more useful to reason forwards and so the other come to be neglect there be fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically ""i confess say that do not quite follow you ""i hardly expect that you would let i see if can make it clear most people if you describe train of event to they will tell you what the result would be they can put those event together in their mind and argue from they that something will come to pass there be few people however who if you tell they result would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the step be which lead up to that result this power be what mean when talk of reasoning backwards or analytically ""i understand say i."now this be case in which you be give the result and have to find everything else for yourself now let i endeavour to show you the different step in my reasoning to begin at the beginning approach the house as you know on foot and with my mind entirely free from all impression naturally begin by examine the roadway and there as have already explain to you see clearly the mark of cab which ascertain by inquiry must have be there during the night satisfy myself that it be cab and not private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheel the ordinary london growler be considerably less wide than gentleman 's brougham "this be the first point gain then walk slowly down the garden path which happen to be compose of clay soil peculiarly suitable for take impression no doubt it appear to you to be mere trample line of slush but to my train eye every mark upon its surface have meaning there be no branch of detective science which be so important and so much neglect as the art of trace footstep happily have always lay great stress upon it and much practice have make it second nature to i see the heavy footmark of the constable but see also the track of the two man who have first pass through the garden it be easy to tell that they have be before the other because in place their mark have be entirely obliterate by the other come upon the top of they in this way my second link be form which tell i that the nocturnal visitor be two in number one remarkable for his height as calculate from the length of his stride and the other fashionably dress to judge from the small and elegant impression leave by his boot "on enter the house this last inference be confirm my well boot man lie before i the tall one then have do the murder if murder there be there be no wound upon the dead man 's person but the agitated expression upon his face assure i that he have foresee his fate before it come upon he man who die from heart disease or any sudden natural cause never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their feature having sniff the dead man 's lip detect slightly sour smell and come to the conclusion that he have have poison force upon he again argue that it have be force upon he from the hatred and fear express upon his face by the method of exclusion have arrive at this result for no other hypothesis would meet the fact do not imagine that it be very unheard of idea the forcible administration of poison be by no mean new thing in criminal annal the case of dolsky in odessa and of leturier in montpellier will occur at once to any toxicologist "and now come the great question as to the reason why robbery have not be the object of the murder for nothing be take be it politic then or be it woman that be the question which confront i be incline from the first to the latter supposition political assassin be only too glad to do their work and to fly this murder have on the contrary be do most deliberately and the perpetrator have leave his track all over the room show that he have be there all the time it must have be private wrong and not political one which call for such methodical revenge when the inscription be discover upon the wall be more inclined than ever to my opinion the thing be too evidently blind when the ring be find however it settle the question clearly the murderer have use it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman it be at this point that ask gregson whether he have enquire in his telegram to cleveland as to any particular point in mr. drebber 's former career he answer you remember in the negative "i then proceed to make careful examination of the room which confirm i in my opinion as to the murderer 's height and furnish i with the additional detail as to the trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nail have already come to the conclusion since there be no sign of struggle that the blood which cover the floor have burst from the murderer 's nose in his excitement could perceive that the track of blood coincide with the track of his foot it be seldom that any man unless he be very full blooded break out in this way through emotion so hazard the opinion that the criminal be probably robust and ruddy face man event prove that have judge correctly "having leave the house proceed to do what gregson have neglect telegraph to the head of the police at cleveland limit my enquiry to the circumstance connect with the marriage of enoch drebber the answer be conclusive it tell i that drebber have already apply for the protection of the law against an old rival in love name jefferson hope and that this same hope be at present in europe know now that hold the clue to the mystery in my hand and all that remain be to secure the murderer "i have already determine in my own mind that the man who have walk into the house with drebber be none other than the man who have drive the cab the mark in the road show i that the horse have wander on in way which would have be impossible have there be anyone in charge of it where then could the driver be unless he be inside the house again it be absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out deliberate crime under the very eye as it be of third person who be sure to betray he lastly suppose one man wish to dog another through
