mr. sherlock holmes who be usually very late in the morning save upon those not infrequent occasion when he be up all night be seat at the breakfast table stand upon the hearth rug and pick up the stick which our visitor have leave behind he the night before it be fine thick piece of wood bulbous head of the sort which be know as penang lawyer just under the head be broad silver band nearly an inch across to james mortimer m.r.c.s. from his friend of the c.c.h. be engrave upon it with the date 1884 it be just such stick as the old fashioned family practitioner use to carry dignified solid and reassuring "well watson what do you make of it?"holme be sit with his back to i and have give he no sign of my occupation "how do you know what be do believe you have eye in the back of your head ""i have at least well polished silver plate coffee pot in front of i say he but tell i watson what do you make of our visitor 's stick since we have be so unfortunate as to miss he and have no notion of his errand this accidental souvenir become of importance let i hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it ""i think say follow as far as could the method of my companion that dr. mortimer be successful elderly medical man well esteemed since those who know he give he this mark of their appreciation ""good say holmes excellent!""i think also that the probability be in favour of his be country practitioner who do great deal of his visit on foot ""why so?""because this stick though originally very handsome one have be so knock about that can hardly imagine town practitioner carry it the thick iron ferrule be wear down so it be evident that he have do great amount of walk with it ""perfectly sound say holmes "and then again there be the friend of the c.c.h. should guess that to be the something hunt the local hunt to whose member he have possibly give some surgical assistance and which have make he small presentation in return ""really watson you excel yourself say holmes push back his chair and light cigarette be bind to say that in all the account which you have be so good as to give of my own small achievement you have habitually underrate your own ability it may be that you be not yourself luminous but you be conductor of light some people without possess genius have remarkable power of stimulate it confess my dear fellow that be very much in your debt "he have never say as much before and must admit that his word give i keen pleasure for have often be pique by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempt which have make to give publicity to his method be proud too to think that have so far master his system as to apply it in way which earn his approval he now take the stick from my hand and examine it for few minute with his naked eye then with an expression of interest he lay down his cigarette and carry the cane to the window he look over it again with convex lens "interesting though elementary say he as he return to his favourite corner of the settee there be certainly one or two indication upon the stick it give we the basis for several deduction ""has anything escape i ask with some self importance trust that there be nothing of consequence which have overlooked?""i be afraid my dear watson that most of your conclusion be erroneous when say that you stimulate i mean to be frank that in note your fallacy be occasionally guide towards the truth not that you be entirely wrong in this instance the man be certainly country practitioner and he walk good deal ""then be right ""to that extent ""but that be all ""no no my dear watson not all by no means all would suggest for example that presentation to doctor be more likely to come from hospital than from hunt and that when the initial c.c. be place before that hospital the word charing cross very naturally suggest themselves ""you may be right ""the probability lie in that direction and if we take this as work hypothesis we have fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor ""well then suppose that c.c.h. do stand for charing cross hospital what further inference may we draw?""do none suggest themselves you know my method apply them!""i can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man have practise in town before go to the country ""i think that we might venture little far than this look at it in this light on what occasion would it be most probable that such presentation would be make when would his friend unite to give he pledge of their good will obviously at the moment when dr. mortimer withdraw from the service of the hospital in order to start practice for himself we know there have be presentation we believe there have be change from town hospital to country practice be it then stretch our inference too far to say that the presentation be on the occasion of the change?""it certainly seem probable ""now you will observe that he could not have be on the staff of the hospital since only man well establish in london practice could hold such position and such one would not drift into the country what be he then if he be in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have be house surgeon or house physician little more than senior student and he leave five year ago the date be on the stick so your grave middle aged family practitioner vanish into thin air my dear watson and there emerge young fellow under thirty amiable unambitious absent minded and the possessor of favourite dog which should describe roughly as be large than terrier and small than mastiff "i laugh incredulously as sherlock holmes lean back in his settee and blow little wavering ring of smoke up to the ceiling "as to the latter part have no means of check you say but at least it be not difficult to find out few particular about the man 's age and professional career from my small medical shelf take down the medical directory and turn up the name there be several mortimers but only one who could be our visitor read his record aloud "mortimer james m.r.c.s. 1882 grimpen dartmoor devon house surgeon from 1882 to 1884 at charing cross hospital winner of the jackson prize for comparative

1883 medical officer for the parish of grimpen thorsley and high barrow no mention of that local hunt watson say holmes with mischievous smile but country doctor as you very astutely observe think that be fairly justified in my inference as to the adjective say if remember right amiable unambitious and absent minded it be my experience that it be only an amiable man in this world who receive testimonial only an unambitious one who abandon london career for the country and only an absent minded one who leave his stick and not his visit card after wait an hour in your room ""and the dog?""ha be in the habit of carry this stick behind his master be heavy stick the dog have hold it tightly by the middle and the mark of his tooth be very plainly visible the dog 's jaw as show in the space between these mark be too broad in my opinion for terri and not broad enough for mastiff it may have be yes by jove it be curly haired spaniel "he have rise and pace the room as he speak now he halt in the recess of the window there be such ring of conviction in his voice that glance up in surprise "my dear fellow how can you possibly be so sure of that?""for the very simple reason that see the dog himself on our very door step and there be the ring of its owner do n't move beg you watson he be professional brother of yours and your presence may be of assistance to i now be the dramatic moment of fate watson when you hear step upon the stair which be walk into your life and you know not whether for good or ill what do dr. james mortimer the man of science ask of sherlock holmes the specialist in crime come in!"the appearance of our visitor be surprise to i since have expect typical country practitioner he be very tall thin man with long nose like beak which jut out between two keen gray eye set closely together and sparkle brightly from behind pair of gold rim glass he be clothe in professional but rather slovenly fashion for his frock coat be dingy and his trouser fray though young his long back be already bow and he walk with forward thrust of his head and general air of peer benevolence as he enter his eye fall upon the stick in holmes 's hand and he run towards it with an exclamation of joy be so very glad say he be not sure whether have leave it here or in the shipping office would not lose that stick for the world ""a presentation see say holmes "yes sir ""from charing cross hospital?""from one or two friend there on the occasion of my marriage ""dear dear that be bad say holmes shake his head dr. mortimer blink through his glass in mild astonishment why be it bad?""only that you have disarrange our little deduction your marriage you say?""yes sir marry and so leave the hospital and with it all hope of consulting practice it be necessary to make home of my own ""come come we be not so far wrong after all say holmes and now dr. james mortimer mister sir mister humble m.r.c.s.""and man of precise mind evidently ""a dabbler in science mr. holmes picker up of shell on the shore of the great unknown ocean presume that it be mr. sherlock holmes whom be address and not no this be my friend dr. watson ""glad to meet you sir have hear your name mention in connection with that of your friend you interest i very much mr. holmes have hardly expect so dolichocephalic skull or such well mark supra orbital development would you have any objection to my run my finger along your parietal fissure cast of your skull sir until the original be available would be an ornament to any anthropological museum it be not my intention to be fulsome but confess that covet your skull "sherlock holme wave our strange visitor into chair you be an enthusiast in your line of thought perceive sir as be in mine say he observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarette have no hesitation in light one "the man draw out paper and tobacco and twirl the one up in the other with surprising dexterity he have long quiver finger as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect holmes be silent but his little darting glance show i the interest which he take in our curious companion presume sir say he at last that it be not merely for the purpose of examine my skull that you have do i the honour to call here last night and again today?""no sir no though be happy to have have the opportunity of do that as well come to you mr. holmes because recognize that be myself an unpractical man and because be suddenly confront with most serious and extraordinary problem recognize as do that you be the second high expert in europe indeed sir may inquire who have the honour to be the first ask holmes with some asperity "to the man of precisely scientific mind the work of monsieur bertillon must always appeal strongly ""then have you not well consult him?""i say sir to the precisely scientific mind but as practical man of affair it be acknowledge that you stand alone trust sir that have not inadvertently just little say holmes think dr. mortimer you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell i plainly what the exact nature of the problem be in which you demand my assistance ""i have in my pocket manuscript say dr. james mortimer "i observe it as you enter the room say holmes "it be an old manuscript ""early eighteenth century unless it be forgery ""how can you say that sir?""you have present an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have be talk it would be poor expert who could not give the date of document within decade or so you may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject put that at 1730.""the exact date be 1742 dr. mortimer draw it from his breast pocket this family paper be commit to my care by sir charles baskerville whose sudden and tragic death some three month ago create so much excitement in devonshire may say that be his personal friend as well as his medical attendant he be strong minded man sir shrewd practical and as unimaginative as be myself yet he take this document very seriously and his mind be prepared for just such an end as do eventually overtake he "holme stretch out his hand for the manuscript and flatten it upon his knee you will observe watson the alternative use of the long and the short it be one of several indication which enable i to fix the date "i look over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script at the head be write baskerville hall and below in large scrawl figure 1742.""it appear to be statement of some sort ""yes it be statement of certain legend which run in the baskerville family ""but understand that it be something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me?""most modern most practical press matter which must be decide within twenty four hour but the manuscript be short and be intimately connect with the affair with your permission will read it to you "holme lean back in his chair place his finger tip together and close his eye with an air of resignation dr. mortimer turn the manuscript to the light and read in high crack voice the follow curious old world narrative:"of the origin of the hound of the baskervilles there have be many statement yet as come in direct line from hugo baskerville and as have the story from my father who also have it from his have set it down with all belief that it occur even as be here set forth and would have you believe my son that the same justice which punish sin may also most graciously forgive it and that no ban be so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be remove learn then from this story not to fear the fruit of the past but rather to be circumspect in the future that those foul passion whereby our family have suffer so grievously may not again be loose to our undoing know then that in the time of the great rebellion the history of which by the learn lord clarendon most earnestly commend to your attention this manor of baskerville be hold by hugo of that name nor can it be gainsay that he be most wild profane and godless man this in truth his neighbour might have pardon see that saint have never flourish in those part but there be in he certain wanton and cruel humour which make his name by word through the west it chance that this hugo come to love if indeed so dark passion may be know under so bright name the daughter of yeoman who hold land near the baskerville estate but the young maiden be discreet and of good repute would ever avoid he for she fear his evil name so it come to pass that one michaelmas this hugo with five or six of his idle and wicked companion steal down upon the farm and carry off the maiden her father and brother be from home as he well know when they have bring she to the hall the maiden be place in an upper chamber while hugo and his friend sit down to long carouse as be their nightly custom now the poor lass upstairs be like to have her wit turn at the singing and shouting and terrible oath which come up to she from below for they say that the word use by hugo baskerville when he be in wine be such as might blast the man who say they at last in the stress of her fear she do that which might have daunt the brave or most active man for by the aid of the growth of ivy which cover and still cover the south wall she come down from under the eave and so homeward across the moor there be three league betwixt the hall and her father 's farm it chance that some little time later hugo leave his guest to carry food and drink with other bad thing perchance to his captive and so find the cage empty and the bird escape then as it would seem he become as one that hath devil for rush down the stair into the dining hall he spring upon the great table flagon and trencher fly before he and he cry aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the powers of evil if he might but overtake the wench and while the reveller stand aghast at the fury of the man one more wicked or it may be more drunken than the rest cry out that they should put the hound upon she whereat hugo run from the house cry to his groom that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack and give the hound kerchief of the maid 's he swing they to the line and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor now for some space the reveller stand agape unable to understand all that have be do in such haste but anon their bemused wit awake to the nature of the deed which be like to be do upon the moorland everything be now in an uproar some call for their pistol some for their horse and some for another flask of wine but at length some sense come back to their craze mind and the whole of they thirteen in number take horse and start in pursuit the moon shine clear above they and they ride swiftly abreast take that course which the maid must need have take if she be to reach her own home "they have go mile or two when they pass one of the night shepherd upon the moorland and they cry to he to know if he have see the hunt and the man as the story go be so craze with fear that he could scarce speak but at last he say that he have indeed see the unhappy maiden with the hound upon her track but have see more than that say he for hugo baskerville pass i upon his black mare and there run mute behind he such hound of hell as god forbid should ever be at my heel so the drunken squire curse the shepherd and ride onward but soon their skin turn cold for there come galloping across the moor and the black mare dabble with white froth go past with trail bridle and empty saddle then the reveller ride close together for great fear be on they but they still follow over the moor though each have he be alone would have be right glad to have turn his horse 's head ride slowly in this fashion they come at last upon the hound these though know for their valour and their breed be whimper in cluster at the head of deep dip or goyal as we call it upon the moor some slink away and some with start hackle and stare eye gaze down the narrow valley before they the company have come to halt more sober man as you may guess than when they start the most of they would by no mean advance but three of they the bold or it may be the most drunken ride forward down the goyal now it open into broad space in which stand two of those great stone still to be see there which be set by certain forget people in the day of old the moon be shine bright upon the clearing and there in the centre lie the unhappy maid where she have fall dead of fear and of fatigue but it be not the sight of her body nor yet be it that of the body of hugo baskerville lie near she which raise the hair upon the head of these three dare devil roysterer but it be that stand over hugo and pluck at his throat there stand foul thing great black beast shape like hound yet large than any hound that ever mortal eye have rest upon and even as they look the thing tear the throat out of hugo baskerville on which as it turn its blaze eye and dripping jaw upon they the three shriek with fear and ride for dear life still scream across the moor one it be say die that very night of what he have see and the other twain be but break man for the rest of their day "such be the tale my son of the coming of the hound which be say to have plague the family so sorely ever since if have set it down it be because that which be clearly know hath less terror than that which be but hint at and guess nor can it be deny that many of the family have be unhappy in their death which have be sudden bloody and mysterious yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of providence which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which be threaten in holy writ to that providence my son hereby commend you and counsel you by way of caution to forbear from cross the moor in those dark hour when the power of evil be exalted this from hugo baskerville to his son rodger and john with instruction that they say nothing thereof to their sister elizabeth.]"when dr. mortimer have finish read this singular narrative he push his spectacle up on his forehead and stare across at mr. sherlock holmes the latter yawn and toss the end of his cigarette into the fire "well say he "do you not find it interesting?""to collector of fairy tale "dr mortimer draw fold newspaper out of his pocket "now mr. holmes we will give you something little more recent this be the devon county chronicle of may 14th of this year it be short account of the fact elicit at the death of sir charles baskerville which occur few day before that date "my friend lean little forward and his expression become intent our visitor readjust his glass and began:"the recent sudden death of sir charles baskerville whose name have be mention as the probable liberal candidate for mid devon at the next election have cast gloom over the county though sir charles have reside at baskerville hall for comparatively short period his amiability of character and extreme generosity have win the affection and respect of all who have be bring into contact with he in these day of nouveaux rich it be refreshing to find case where the scion of an old county family which have fall upon evil day be able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with he to restore the fallen grandeur of his line sir charles as be well know make large sum of money in south african speculation more wise than those who go on until the wheel
