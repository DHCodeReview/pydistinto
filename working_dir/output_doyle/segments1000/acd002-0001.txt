turn against they he realize his gain and return to england with they it be only two year since he take up his residence at baskerville hall and it be common talk how large be those scheme of reconstruction and improvement which have be interrupt by his death be himself childless it be his openly express desire that the whole countryside should within his own lifetime profit by his good fortune and many will have personal reason for bewail his untimely end his generous donation to local and county charity have be frequently chronicle in these column the circumstance connect with the death of sir charles can not be say to have be entirely clear up by the inquest but at least enough have be do to dispose of those rumour to which local superstition have give rise there be no reason whatever to suspect foul play or to imagine that death could be from any but natural cause sir charles be widower and man who may be say to have be in some way of an eccentric habit of mind in spite of his considerable wealth he be simple in his personal taste and his indoor servant at baskerville hall consist of married couple name barrymore the husband act as butler and the wife as housekeeper their evidence corroborate by that of several friend tend to show that sir charles 's health have for some time be impair and point especially to some affection of the heart manifest itself in change of colour breathlessness and acute attack of nervous depression dr. james mortimer the friend and medical attendant of the deceased have give evidence to the same effect the fact of the case be simple sir charles baskerville be in the habit every night before go to bed of walk down the famous yew alley of baskerville hall the evidence of the barrymores show that this have be his custom on the fourth of may sir charles have declare his intention of start next day for london and have order barrymore to prepare his luggage that night he go out as usual for his nocturnal walk in the course of which he be in the habit of smoke cigar he never return at twelve o'clock barrymore find the hall door still open become alarmed and light lantern go in search of his master the day have be wet and sir charles 's footmark be easily trace down the alley halfway down this walk there be gate which lead out on to the moor there be indication that sir charles have stand for some little time here he then proceed down the alley and it be at the far end of it that his body be discover one fact which have not be explain be the statement of barrymore that his master 's footprint alter their character from the time that he pass the moor gate and that he appear from thence onward to have be walk upon his toe one murphy gipsy horse dealer be on the moor at no great distance at the time but he appear by his own confession to have be the bad for drink he declare that he hear cry but be unable to state from what direction they come no sign of violence be to be discover upon sir charles 's person and though the doctor 's evidence point to an almost incredible facial distortion so great that dr. mortimer refuse at first to believe that it be indeed his friend and patient who lie before he it be explain that that be symptom which be not unusual in case of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion this explanation be bear out by the post mortem examination which show long stand organic disease and the coroner 's jury return verdict in accordance with the medical evidence it be well that this be so for it be obviously of the utmost importance that sir charles 's heir should settle at the hall and continue the good work which have be so sadly interrupted have the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic story which have be whisper in connection with the affair it might have be difficult to find tenant for baskerville hall it be understand that the next of kin be mr. henry baskerville if he be still alive the son of sir charles baskerville 's young brother the young man when last hear of be in america and inquiry be be institute with view to inform he of his good fortune "dr mortimer refolde his paper and replace it in his pocket those be the public fact mr. holmes in connection with the death of sir charles baskerville ""i must thank you say sherlock holmes for call my attention to case which certainly present some feature of interest have observe some newspaper comment at the time but be exceedingly preoccupy by that little affair of the vatican cameo and in my anxiety to oblige the pope lose touch with several interesting english case this article you say contain all the public facts?""it do ""then let i have the private one he lean back put his finger tip together and assume his most impassive and judicial expression "in do so say dr. mortimer who have begin to show sign of some strong emotion be tell that which have not confide to anyone my motive for withhold it from the coroner 's inquiry be that man of science shrink from place himself in the public position of seem to indorse popular superstition have the further motive that baskerville hall as the paper say would certainly remain untenanted if anything be do to increase its already rather grim reputation for both these reason think that be justify in tell rather less than know since no practical good could result from it but with you there be no reason why should not be perfectly frank "the moor be very sparsely inhabit and those who live near each other be throw very much together for this reason see good deal of sir charles baskerville with the exception of mr. frankland of lafter hall and mr. stapleton the naturalist there be no other man of education within many mile sir charles be retire man but the chance of his illness bring we together and community of interest in science keep we so he have bring back much scientific information from south africa and many charming evening we have spend together discuss the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the hottentot "within the last few month it become increasingly plain to i that sir charles 's nervous system be strain to the breaking point he have take this legend which have read you exceedingly to heart so much so that although he would walk in his own ground nothing would induce he to go out upon the moor at night incredible as it may appear to you mr. holmes he be honestly convince that dreadful fate overhang his family and certainly the record which he be able to give of his ancestor be not encouraging the idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunt he and on more than one occasion he have ask i whether have on my medical journey at night ever see any strange creature or hear the baying of hound the latter question he put to i several time and always with voice which vibrate with excitement "i can well remember drive up to his house in the evening some three week before the fatal event he chance to be at his hall door have descend from my gig and be stand in front of he when see his eye fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past i with an expression of the most dreadful horror whisk round and have just time to catch glimpse of something which take to be large black calf pass at the head of the drive so excited and alarm be he that be compel to go down to the spot where the animal have be and look around for it it be go however and the incident appear to make the bad impression upon his mind stay with he all the evening and it be on that occasion to explain the emotion which he have show that he confide to my keeping that narrative which read to you when first come mention this small episode because it assume some importance in view of the tragedy which follow but be convince at the time that the matter be entirely trivial and that his excitement have no justification "it be at my advice that sir charles be about to go to london his heart be know affect and the constant anxiety in which he live however chimerical the cause of it might be be evidently have serious effect upon his health think that few month among the distraction of town would send he back new man mr. stapleton mutual friend who be much concerned at his state of health be of the same opinion at the last instant come this terrible catastrophe "on the night of sir charles 's death barrymore the butler who make the discovery send perkins the groom on horseback to i and as be sit up late be able to reach baskerville hall within an hour of the event check and corroborate all the fact which be mention at the inquest follow the footstep down the yew alley see the spot at the moor gate where he seem to have wait remark the change in the shape of the print after that point note that there be no other footstep save those of barrymore on the soft gravel and finally carefully examine the body which have not be touch until my arrival sir charles lie on his face his arm out his finger dig into the ground and his feature convulse with some strong emotion to such an extent that could hardly have swear to his identity there be certainly no physical injury of any kind but one false statement be make by barrymore at the inquest he say that there be no trace upon the ground round the body he do not observe any but do some little distance off but fresh and clear ""footprints?""footprints ""a man 's or woman's?"dr mortimer look strangely at we for an instant and his voice sink almost to whisper as he answer "mr holme they be the footprint of gigantic hound!"i confess at these word shudder pass through i there be thrill in the doctor 's voice which show that he be himself deeply move by that which he tell we holme lean forward in his excitement and his eye have the hard dry glitter which shoot from they when he be keenly interested "you see this?""as clearly as see you ""and you say nothing?""what be the use?""how be it that no one else see it?""the mark be some twenty yard from the body and no one give they thought do n't suppose should have do so have not know this legend ""there be many sheep dog on the moor?""no doubt but this be no sheep dog ""you say it be large?""enormous ""but it have not approach the body?""no ""what sort of night be it?'"damp and raw ""but not actually raining?""no ""what be the alley like?""there be two line of old yew hedge twelve foot high and impenetrable the walk in the centre be about eight foot across ""is there anything between the hedge and the walk?""yes there be strip of grass about six foot broad on either side ""i understand that the yew hedge be penetrate at one point by gate?""yes the wicket gate which lead on to the moor ""is there any other opening?""none ""so that to reach the yew alley one either have to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moor gate?""there be an exit through summer house at the far end ""had sir charles reach this?""no he lie about fifty yard from it ""now tell i dr. mortimer and this be important the mark which you see be on the path and not on the grass?""no mark could show on the grass ""were they on the same side of the path as the moor gate?""yes they be on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor gate ""you interest i exceedingly another point be the wicket gate closed?""close and padlock ""how high be it?""about four foot high ""then anyone could have get over it?""yes ""and what mark do you see by the wicket gate?""none in particular ""good heaven do no one examine?""yes examine myself ""and find nothing?""it be all very confused sir charles have evidently stand there for five or ten minute ""how do you know that?""because the ash have twice drop from his cigar ""excellent this be colleague watson after our own heart but the marks?""he have leave his own mark all over that small patch of gravel could discern no other "sherlock holme strike his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture "if have only be there he cry it be evidently case of extraordinary interest and one which present immense opportunity to the scientific expert that gravel page upon which might have read so much have be long ere this smudge by the rain and deface by the clog of curious peasant oh dr. mortimer dr. mortimer to think that you should not have call i in you have indeed much to answer for ""i could not call you in mr. holmes without disclose these fact to the world and have already give my reason for not wish to do so besides besides why do you hesitate?""there be realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detective be helpless ""you mean that the thing be supernatural?""i do not positively say so ""no but you evidently think it ""since the tragedy mr. holmes there have come to my ear several incident which be hard to reconcile with the settle order of nature ""for example?""i find that before the terrible event occur several people have see creature upon the moor which correspond with this baskerville demon and which could not possibly be any animal know to science they all agree that it be huge creature luminous ghastly and spectral have cros examine these man one of they hard headed countryman one farrier and one moorland farmer who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition exactly correspond to the hell hound of the legend assure you that there be reign of terror in the district and that it be hardy man who will cross the moor at night ""and you train man of science believe it to be supernatural?""i do not know what to believe "holme shrug his shoulder have hitherto confine my investigation to this world say he in modest way have combat evil but to take on the father of evil himself would perhaps be too ambitious task yet you must admit that the footmark be material ""the original hound be material enough to tug man 's throat out and yet he be diabolical as well ""i see that you have quite go over to the supernaturalist but now dr. mortimer tell i this if you hold these view why have you come to consult i at all you tell i in the same breath that it be useless to investigate sir charles 's death and that you desire i to do it ""i do not say that desire you to do it ""then how can assist you?""by advise i as to what should do with sir henry baskerville who arrive at waterloo station dr. mortimer look at his watch in exactly one hour and quarter ""he be the heir?""yes on the death of sir charles we inquire for this young gentleman and find that he have be farm in canada from the account which have reach we he be an excellent fellow in every way speak now not as medical man but as trustee and executor of sir charles 's will ""there be no other claimant presume?""none the only other kinsman whom we have be able to trace be rodger baskerville the young of three brother of whom poor sir charles be the elder the second brother who die young be the father of this lad henry the third rodger be the black sheep of the family he come of the old masterful baskerville strain and be the very image they tell i of the family picture of old hugo he make england too hot to hold he flee to central america and die there in 1876 of yellow fever henry be the last of the baskervilles in one hour and five minute meet he at waterloo station have have wire that he arrive at southampton this morning now mr. holmes what would you advise i to do with him?""why should he not go to the home of his fathers?""it seem natural do it not and yet consider that every baskerville who go there meet with an evil fate feel sure that if sir charles could have speak with i before his death he would have warn i against bring this the last of the old race and the heir to great wealth to that deadly place and yet it can not be deny that the prosperity of the whole poor bleak countryside depend upon his presence all the good work which have be do by sir charles will crash to the ground if there be no tenant of the hall fear lest should be sway too much by my own obvious interest in the matter and that be why bring the case before you and ask for your advice "holme consider for little time "put into plain word the matter be this say he in your opinion there be diabolical agency which make dartmoor an unsafe abode for baskerville that be your opinion?""at least might go the length of say that there be some evidence that this may be so ""exactly but surely if your supernatural theory be correct it could work the young man evil in london as easily as in devonshire devil with merely local power like parish vestry would be too inconceivable thing ""you put the matter more flippantly mr. holmes than you would probably do if you be bring into personal contact with these thing your advice then as understand it be that the young man will be as safe in devonshire as in london he come in fifty minute what would you recommend?""i recommend sir that you take cab call off your spaniel who be scratch at my front door and proceed to waterloo to meet sir henry baskerville ""and then?""and then you will say nothing to he at all until have make up my mind about the matter ""how long will it take you to make up your mind?""twenty four hour at ten o'clock tomorrow dr. mortimer will be much oblige to you if you will call upon i here and it will be of help to i in my plan for the future if you will bring sir henry baskerville with you ""i will do so mr. holmes he scribble the appointment on his shirt cuff and hurry off in his strange peering absent minded fashion holme stop he at the head of the stair "only one more question dr. mortimer you say that before sir charles baskerville 's death several people see this apparition upon the moor?""three people do ""did any see it after?""i have not hear of any ""thank you good morning "holme return to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which mean that he have congenial task before he "going out watson?""unles can help you ""no my dear fellow it be at the hour of action that turn to you for aid but this be splendid really unique from some point of view when you pass bradley 's would you ask he to send up pound of the strong shag tobacco thank you it would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening then should be very glad to compare impression as to this most interesting problem which have be submit to we this morning "i know that seclusion and solitude be very necessary for my friend in those hour of intense mental concentration during which he weigh every particle of evidence construct alternative theory balance one against the other and make up his mind as to which point be essential and which immaterial therefore spend the day at my club and do not return to baker street until evening it be nearly nine o'clock when find myself in the sitting room once more my first impression as open the door be that fire have break out for the room be so fill with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table be blur by it as enter however my fear be set at rest for it be the acrid fume of strong coarse tobacco which take i by the throat and set i cough through the haze have vague vision of holmes in his dressing gown coil up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lip several roll of paper lie around he "caught cold watson say he "no it be this poisonous atmosphere ""i suppose it be pretty thick now that you mention it ""thick it be intolerable ""open the window then you have be at your club all day perceive ""my dear holmes!""am right?""certainly but how?"he laugh at my bewildered expression there be delightful freshness about you watson which make it pleasure to exercise any small power which possess at your expense gentleman go forth on showery and miry day he return immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boot he have be fixture therefore all day he be not man with intimate friend where then could he have be be it not obvious?""well it be rather obvious ""the world be full of obvious thing which nobody by any chance ever observe where do you think that have been?""a fixture also ""on the contrary have be to devonshire ""in spirit?""exactly my body have remain in this armchair and have regret to observe consume in my absence two large pot of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco after you leave send down to stamford 's for the ordnance map of this portion of the moor and my spirit have hover over it all day flatter myself that could find my way about ""a large scale map presume?""very large "he unroll one section and hold it over his knee here you have the particular district which concern we that be baskerville hall in the middle ""with wood round it?""exactly fancy the yew alley though not mark under that name must stretch along this line with the moor as you perceive upon the right of it this small clump of building here be the hamlet of grimpen where our friend dr. mortimer have his headquarters within radius of five mile there be as you see only very few scatter dwelling here be lafter hall which be mention in the narrative there be house indicate here which may be the residence of the naturalist stapleton if remember right be his name here be two moorland farmhouse high tor and foulmire then fourteen mile away the great convict prison of princetown between and around these scatter point extend the desolate lifeless moor this then be the stage upon which tragedy have be play and upon which we may help to play it again ""it must be wild place ""yes the setting be worthy one if the devil do desire to have hand in the affair of man then you be yourself incline to the supernatural explanation ""the devil 's agent may be of flesh and blood may they not there be two question wait for we at the outset the one be whether any crime have be commit at all the second be what be the crime and how be it commit of course if dr. mortimer 's surmise should be correct and we be deal with force outside the ordinary law of nature there be an end of our investigation but we be bind to exhaust all other hypothesis before fall back upon this one think we 'll shut that window again if you do n't mind it be singular thing but find that concentrated atmosphere help concentration of thought have not push it to the length of get into box to think but that be the logical outcome of my conviction have you turn the case over in your mind?""yes have think good deal of it in the course of the day ""what do you make of it?""it be very bewildering ""it have certainly character of its own there be point of distinction about it that change in the footprint for example what do you make of that?""mortimer say that the man have walk on tiptoe down that portion of the alley ""he only repeat what some fool have say at the inquest why should man walk on tiptoe down the alley?""what then?""he be run watson run desperately run for his life run until he burst his heart and fall dead upon his face ""running from what?""there lie our problem there be indication that the
