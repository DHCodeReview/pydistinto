man be craze with fear before ever he begin to run ""how can you say that?""i be presume that the cause of his fear come to he across the moor if that be so and it seem most probable only man who have lose his wit would have run from the house instead of towards it if the gipsy 's evidence may be take as true he run with cry for help in the direction where help be least likely to be then again whom be he wait for that night and why be he wait for he in the yew alley rather than in his own house?""you think that he be wait for someone?""the man be elderly and infirm we can understand his take an evening stroll but the ground be damp and the night inclement be it natural that he should stand for five or ten minute as dr. mortimer with more practical sense than should have give he credit for deduce from the cigar ash?""but he go out every evening ""i think it unlikely that he wait at the moor gate every evening on the contrary the evidence be that he avoid the moor that night he wait there it be the night before he make his departure for london the thing take shape watson it become coherent might ask you to hand i my violin and we will postpone all far think upon this business until we have have the advantage of meet dr. mortimer and sir henry baskerville in the morning "our breakfast table be clear early and holmes wait in his dressing gown for the promise interview our client be punctual to their appointment for the clock have just strike ten when dr. mortimer be show up follow by the young baronet the latter be small alert dark eyed man about thirty year of age very sturdily build with thick black eyebrow and strong pugnacious face he wear ruddy tint tweed suit and have the weather beat appearance of one who have spend most of his time in the open air and yet there be something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicate the gentleman "this be sir henry baskerville say dr. mortimer "why yes say he and the strange thing be mr. sherlock holmes that if my friend here have not propose come round to you this morning should have come on my own account understand that you think out little puzzle and 've have one this morning which want more thinking out than be able to give it ""pray take seat sir henry do understand you to say that you have yourself have some remarkable experience since you arrive in london?""nothing of much importance mr. holmes only joke as like as not it be this letter if you can call it letter which reach i this morning "he lay an envelope upon the table and we all bend over it it be of common quality grayish in colour the address sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel be print in rough character the post mark charing cross and the date of post the precede evening "who know that you be go to the northumberland hotel ask holmes glance keenly across at our visitor "no one could have know we only decide after meet dr. mortimer ""but dr. mortimer be no doubt already stop there?""no have be stay with friend say the doctor "there be no possible indication that we intend to go to this hotel ""hum someone seem to be very deeply interested in your movement out of the envelope he take half sheet of foolscap paper fold into four this he open and spread flat upon the table across the middle of it single sentence have be form by the expedient of paste print word upon it it run as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor the word moor only be print in ink "now say sir henry baskerville perhaps you will tell i mr. holmes what in thunder be the meaning of that and who it be that take so much interest in my affairs?""what do you make of it dr. mortimer you must allow that there be nothing supernatural about this at any rate?""no sir but it might very well come from someone who be convince that the business be supernatural ""what business ask sir henry sharply it seem to i that all you gentleman know great deal more than do about my own affair ""you shall share our knowledge before you leave this room sir henry promise you that say sherlock holmes we will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document which must have be put together and post yesterday evening have you yesterday 's times watson?""it be here in the corner ""might trouble you for it the inside page please with the lead article he glance swiftly over it run his eye up and down the column capital article this on free trade permit i to give you an extract from it you may be cajole into imagine that your own special trade or your own industry will be encourage by protective tariff but it stand to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country diminish the value of our import and lower the general condition of life in this island '"what do you think of that watson cry holmes in high glee rub his hand together with satisfaction do n't you think that be an admirable sentiment?"dr mortimer look at holmes with an air of professional interest and sir henry baskerville turn pair of puzzled dark eye upon i "i do n't know much about the tariff and thing of that kind say he but it seem to i we 've get bit off the trail so far as that note be concern ""on the contrary think we be particularly hot upon the trail sir henry watson here know more about my method than you do but fear that even he have not quite grasp the significance of this sentence ""no confess that see no connection ""and yet my dear watson there be so very close connection that the one be extract out of the other you your your life reason value keep away from the do n't you see now whence these word have be taken?""by thunder you be right well if that be n't smart cry sir henry "if any possible doubt remain it be settle by the fact that keep away and from the be cut out in one piece ""well now so it is!""really mr. holmes this exceed anything which could have imagine say dr. mortimer gaze at my friend in amazement could understand anyone say that the word be from newspaper but that you should name which and add that it come from the lead article be really one of the most remarkable thing which have ever know how do you do it?""i presume doctor that you could tell the skull of negro from that of an esquimau?""most certainly ""but how?""because that be my special hobby the difference be obvious the supra orbital crest the facial angle the maxillary curve the but this be my special hobby and the difference be equally obvious there be as much difference to my eye between the leaded bourgeois type of times article and the slovenly print of an evening half penny paper as there could be between your negro and your esquimau the detection of type be one of the most elementary branch of knowledge to the special expert in crime though confess that once when be very young confuse the leeds mercury with the western morning news but times leader be entirely distinctive and these word could have be take from nothing else as it be do yesterday the strong probability be that we should find the word in yesterday 's issue ""so far as can follow you then mr. holmes say sir henry baskerville someone cut out this message with scissor nail scissor say holmes you can see that it be very short bladed scissor since the cutter have to take two snip over keep away '""that be so someone then cut out the message with pair of short blade scissor paste it with paste gum say holmes "with gum on to the paper but want to know why the word moor should have be written?""because he could not find it in print the other word be all simple and might be find in any issue but moor would be less common ""why of course that would explain it have you read anything else in this message mr. holmes?""there be one or two indication and yet the utmost pain have be take to remove all clue the address you observe be print in rough character but the times be paper which be seldom find in any hand but those of the highly educate we may take it therefore that the letter be compose by an educate man who wish to pose as an uneducated one and his effort to conceal his own writing suggest that that writing might be know or come to be know by you again you will observe that the word be not gum on in an accurate line but that some be much high than other life for example be quite out of its proper place that may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter on the whole incline to the latter view since the matter be evidently important and it be unlikely that the composer of such letter would be careless if he be in hurry it open up the interesting question why he should be in hurry since any letter post up to early morning would reach sir henry before he would leave his hotel do the composer fear an interruption and from whom?""we be come now rather into the region of guesswork say dr. mortimer "say rather into the region where we balance probability and choose the most likely it be the scientific use of the imagination but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation now you would call it guess no doubt but be almost certain that this address have be write in hotel ""how in the world can you say that?""if you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have give the writer trouble the pen have splutter twice in single word and have run dry three time in short address show that there be very little ink in the bottle now private pen or ink bottle be seldom allow to be in such state and the combination of the two must be quite rare but you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen where it be rare to get anything else yes have very little hesitation in say that could we examine the waste paper basket of the hotel around charing cross until we find the remain of the mutilated times leader we could lay our hand straight upon the person who send this singular message halloa halloa what be this?"he be carefully examine the foolscap upon which the word be paste hold it only an inch or two from his eye "well?""nothing say he throw it down it be blank half sheet of paper without even water mark upon it think we have draw as much as we can from this curious letter and now sir henry have anything else of interest happen to you since you have be in london?""why no mr. holmes think not ""you have not observe anyone follow or watch you?""i seem to have walk right into the thick of dime novel say our visitor why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?""we be come to that you have nothing else to report to we before we go into this matter?""well it depend upon what you think worth report ""i think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth report "sir henry smile do n't know much of british life yet for have spend nearly all my time in the states and in canada but hope that to lose one of your boot be not part of the ordinary routine of life over here ""you have lose one of your boots?""my dear sir cry dr. mortimer it be only mislay you will find it when you return to the hotel what be the use of trouble mr. holmes with trifle of this kind?""well he ask i for anything outside the ordinary routine ""exactly say holmes however foolish the incident may seem you have lose one of your boot you say?""well mislay it anyhow put they both outside my door last night and there be only one in the morning could get no sense out of the chap who clean they the bad of it be that only buy the pair last night in the strand and have never have they on ""if you have never wear they why do you put they out to be cleaned?""they be tan boot and have never be varnish that be why put they out ""then understand that on your arrival in london yesterday you go out at once and buy pair of boots?""i do good deal of shopping dr. mortimer here go round with i you see if be to be squire down there must dress the part and it may be that have get little careless in my way out west among other thing buy these brown boot give six dollar for they and have one steal before ever have they on my foot ""it seem singularly useless thing to steal say sherlock holmes confess that share dr. mortimer 's belief that it will not be long before the miss boot be find ""and now gentleman say the baronet with decision it seem to i that have speak quite enough about the little that know it be time that you keep your promise and give i full account of what we be all drive at ""your request be very reasonable one holme answer dr. mortimer think you could not do well than to tell your story as you tell it to we "thus encourage our scientific friend draw his paper from his pocket and present the whole case as he have do upon the morning before sir henry baskerville listen with the deep attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise "well seem to have come into an inheritance with vengeance say he when the long narrative be finish of course 've hear of the hound ever since be in the nursery it be the pet story of the family though never think of take it seriously before but as to my uncle 's death well it all seem boil up in my head and ca n't get it clear yet you do n't seem quite to have make up your mind whether it be case for policeman or clergyman ""precisely ""and now there be this affair of the letter to i at the hotel suppose that fit into its place ""it seem to show that someone know more than we do about what go on upon the moor say dr. mortimer "and also say holmes that someone be not ill disposed towards you since they warn you of danger ""or it may be that they wish for their own purpose to scare i away ""well of course that be possible also be very much indebted to you dr. mortimer for introduce i to problem which present several interesting alternative but the practical point which we now have to decide sir henry be whether it be or be not advisable for you to go to baskerville hall ""why should not go?""there seem to be danger ""do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings?""well that be what we have to find out ""whichever it be my answer be fix there be no devil in hell mr. holmes and there be no man upon earth who can prevent i from go to the home of my own people and you may take that to be my final answer his dark brow knit and his face flush to dusky red as he speak it be evident that the fiery temper of the baskervilles be not extinct in this their last representative meanwhile say he have hardly have time to think over all that you have tell i it be big thing for man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting should like to have quiet hour by myself to make up my mind now look here mr. holmes it be half past eleven now and be go back right away to my hotel suppose you and your friend dr. watson come round and lunch with we at two 'll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strike i ""is that convenient to you watson?""perfectly ""then you may expect we shall have cab called?""i'd prefer to walk for this affair have flurry i rather ""i'll join you in walk with pleasure say his companion "then we meet again at two o'clock au revoir and good morning!"we hear the step of our visitor descend the stair and the bang of the front door in an instant holmes have change from the languid dreamer to the man of action "your hat and boot watson quick not moment to lose he rush into his room in his dressing gown and be back again in few second in frock coat we hurry together down the stair and into the street dr. mortimer and baskerville be still visible about two hundred yard ahead of we in the direction of oxford street "shall run on and stop them?""not for the world my dear watson be perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine our friend be wise for it be certainly very fine morning for walk "he quicken his pace until we have decrease the distance which divide we by about half then still keep hundred yard behind we follow into oxford street and so down regent street once our friend stop and stare into shop window upon which holmes do the same an instant afterwards he give little cry of satisfaction and follow the direction of his eager eye see that hansom cab with man inside which have halt on the other side of the street be now proceed slowly onward again "there be our man watson come along we 'll have good look at he if we can do no more "at that instant be aware of bushy black beard and pair of pierce eye turn upon we through the side window of the cab instantly the trapdoor at the top fly up something be scream to the driver and the cab fly madly off down regent street holme look eagerly round for another but no empty one be in sight then he dash in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic but the start be too great and already the cab be out of sight "there now say holmes bitterly as he emerge pant and white with vexation from the tide of vehicle be ever such bad luck and such bad management too watson watson if you be an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes!""who be the man?""i have not an idea ""a spy?""well it be evident from what we have hear that baskerville have be very closely shadow by someone since he have be in town how else could it be know so quickly that it be the northumberland hotel which he have choose if they have follow he the first day argue that they would follow he also the second you may have observe that twice stroll over to the window while dr. mortimer be read his legend ""yes remember ""i be look out for loiterer in the street but see none we be deal with clever man watson this matter cut very deep and though have not finally make up my mind whether it be benevolent or malevolent agency which be in touch with we be conscious always of power and design when our friend leave at once follow they in the hope of mark down their invisible attendant so wily be he that he have not trust himself upon foot but he have avail himself of cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past they and so escape their notice his method have the additional advantage that if they be to take cab he be all ready to follow they it have however one obvious disadvantage ""it put he in the power of the cabman ""exactly ""what pity we do not get the number!""my dear watson clumsy as have be you surely do not seriously imagine that neglect to get the number no 2704 be our man but that be no use to we for the moment ""i fail to see how you could have do more ""on observe the cab should have instantly turn and walk in the other direction should then at my leisure have hire second cab and follow the first at respectful distance or well still have drive to the northumberland hotel and wait there when our unknown have follow baskerville home we should have have the opportunity of play his own game upon himself and see where he make for as it be by an indiscreet eagerness which be take advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent we have betray ourselves and lose our man "we have be saunter slowly down regent street during this conversation and dr. mortimer with his companion have long vanish in front of we "there be no object in our follow they say holmes the shadow have depart and will not return we must see what further card we have in our hand and play they with decision could you swear to that man 's face within the cab?""i could swear only to the beard ""and so could from which gather that in all probability it be false one clever man upon so delicate an errand have no use for beard save to conceal his feature come in here watson!"he turn into one of the district messenger office where he be warmly greet by the manager "ah wilson see you have not forget the little case in which have the good fortune to help you?""no sir indeed have not you save my good name and perhaps my life ""my dear fellow you exaggerate have some recollection wilson that you have among your boy lad name cartwright who show some ability during the investigation ""yes sir he be still with we ""could you ring he up thank you and should be glad to have change of this five pound note "a lad of fourteen with bright keen face have obey the summon of the manager he stand now gaze with great reverence at the famous detective "let i have the hotel directory say holmes thank you now cartwright there be the name of twenty three hotel here all in the immediate neighbourhood of charing cross do you see?""yes sir ""you will visit each of these in turn ""yes sir ""you will begin in each case by give the outside porter one shilling here be twenty three shilling ""yes sir ""you will tell he that you want to see the waste paper of yesterday you will say that an important telegram have miscarry and that you be look for it you understand?""yes sir ""but what you be really look for be the centre page of the times with some hole cut in it with scissor here be copy of the times it be this page you could easily recognize it could you not?""yes sir ""in each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter to whom also you will give shilling here be twenty three shilling you will then learn in possibly twenty case out of the twenty three that the waste of the day before have be burn or remove in the three other case you will be show heap of paper and you will look for this page of the times among it the odd be enormously against your find it there be ten shilling over in case of emergency let i have report by wire at baker street before evening and now watson it only remain for we to find out by wire the identity of the cabman no 2704 and then we will drop into one of the bond street picture gallery and fill in the time
