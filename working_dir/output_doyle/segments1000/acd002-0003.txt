until we be due at the hotel "sherlock holmes have in very remarkable degree the power of detach his mind at will for two hour the strange business in which we have be involve appear to be forget and he be entirely absorb in the picture of the modern belgian master he would talk of nothing but art of which he have the crudest idea from our leave the gallery until we find ourselves at the northumberland hotel "sir henry baskerville be upstairs expect you say the clerk he ask i to show you up at once when you come ""have you any objection to my looking at your register say holmes "not in the least "the book show that two name have be add after that of baskerville one be theophilus johnson and family of newcastle the other mrs. oldmore and maid of high lodge alton "surely that must be the same johnson whom use to know say holmes to the porter lawyer be he not gray head and walk with limp?""no sir this be mr. johnson the coal owner very active gentleman not old than yourself ""surely you be mistaken about his trade?""no sir he have use this hotel for many year and he be very well known to we ""ah that settle it mrs. oldmore too seem to remember the name excuse my curiosity but often in call upon one friend one find another ""she be an invalid lady sir her husband be once mayor of gloucester she always come to we when she be in town ""thank you be afraid can not claim her acquaintance we have establish most important fact by these question watson he continue in low voice as we go upstairs together we know now that the people who be so interested in our friend have not settle down in his own hotel that mean that while they be as we have see very anxious to watch he they be equally anxious that he should not see they now this be most suggestive fact ""what do it suggest?""it suggest halloa my dear fellow what on earth be the matter?"as we come round the top of the stair we have run up against sir henry baskerville himself his face be flush with anger and he hold an old and dusty boot in one of his hand so furious be he that he be hardly articulate and when he do speak it be in much broad and more western dialect than any which we have hear from he in the morning "seem to i they be play i for sucker in this hotel he cry they 'll find they 've start in to monkey with the wrong man unless they be careful by thunder if that chap ca n't find my miss boot there will be trouble can take joke with the good mr. holmes but they 've get bit over the mark this time ""still look for your boot?""yes sir and mean to find it ""but surely you say that it be new brown boot?""so it be sir and now it be an old black one ""what you do n't mean to say that be just what do mean to say only have three pair in the world the new brown the old black and the patent leather which be wear last night they take one of my brown one and today they have sneak one of the black well have you get it speak out man and do n't stand staring!"an agitate german waiter have appear upon the scene "no sir have make inquiry all over the hotel but can hear no word of it ""well either that boot come back before sundown or 'll see the manager and tell he that go right straight out of this hotel ""it shall be find sir promise you that if you will have little patience it will be find ""mind it be for it be the last thing of mine that 'll lose in this den of thief well well mr. holmes you 'll excuse my trouble you about such trifle think it be well worth troubling about ""why you look very serious over it ""how do you explain it?""i just do n't attempt to explain it it seem the very mad queerest thing that ever happen to i ""the queerest perhaps say holmes thoughtfully "what do you make of it yourself?""well do n't profess to understand it yet this case of yours be very complex sir henry when take in conjunction with your uncle 's death be not sure that of all the five hundred case of capital importance which have handle there be one which cut so deep but we hold several thread in our hand and the odd be that one or other of they guide we to the truth we may waste time in follow the wrong one but soon or later we must come upon the right "we have pleasant luncheon in which little be say of the business which have bring we together it be in the private sitting room to which we afterwards repair that holmes ask baskerville what be his intention "to go to baskerville hall ""and when?""at the end of the week ""on the whole say holmes think that your decision be wise one have ample evidence that you be be dog in london and amid the million of this great city it be difficult to discover who these people be or what their object can be if their intention be evil they might do you mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it you do not know dr. mortimer that you be follow this morning from my house?"dr mortimer start violently follow by whom?""that unfortunately be what can not tell you have you among your neighbour or acquaintance on dartmoor any man with black full beard?""no or let i see why yes barrymore sir charles 's butler be man with full black beard ""ha where be barrymore?""he be in charge of the hall ""we have good ascertain if he be really there or if by any possibility he might be in london ""how can you do that?""give i telegraph form be all ready for sir henry that will do address to mr. barrymore baskerville hall what be the near telegraph office grimpen very good we will send second wire to the postmaster grimpen telegram to mr. barrymore to be deliver into his own hand if absent please return wire to sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel that should let we know before evening whether barrymore be at his post in devonshire or not ""that be so say baskerville by the way dr. mortimer who be this barrymore anyhow?""he be the son of the old caretaker who be dead they have look after the hall for four generation now so far as know he and his wife be as respectable couple as any in the county ""at the same time say baskerville it be clear enough that so long as there be none of the family at the hall these people have mighty fine home and nothing to do ""that be true ""did barrymore profit at all by sir charles 's will ask holmes "he and his wife have five hundred pound each ""ha do they know that they would receive this?""yes sir charles be very fond of talk about the provision of his will ""that be very interesting ""i hope say dr. mortimer that you do not look with suspicious eye upon everyone who receive legacy from sir charles for also have thousand pound leave to i ""indeed and anyone else?""there be many insignificant sum to individual and large number of public charity the residue all go to sir henry ""and how much be the residue?""seven hundred and forty thousand pound "holme raise his eyebrow in surprise have no idea that so gigantic sum be involve say he "sir charles have the reputation of be rich but we do not know how very rich he be until we come to examine his security the total value of the estate be close on to million ""dear i it be stake for which man might well play desperate game and one more question dr. mortimer suppose that anything happen to our young friend here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate?""since rodger baskerville sir charles 's young brother die unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who be distant cousin james desmond be an elderly clergyman in westmoreland ""thank you these detail be all of great interest have you meet mr. james desmond?""yes he once come down to visit sir charles he be man of venerable appearance and of saintly life remember that he refuse to accept any settlement from sir charles though he press it upon he ""and this man of simple taste would be the heir to sir charles 's thousand ""he would be the heir to the estate because that be entail he would also be the heir to the money unless it be will otherwise by the present owner who can of course do what he like with it ""and have you make your will sir henry?""no mr. holmes have not 've have no time for it be only yesterday that learn how matter stand but in any case feel that the money should go with the title and estate that be my poor uncle 's idea how be the owner go to restore the glory of the baskervilles if he have not money enough to keep up the property house land and dollar must go together ""quite so well sir henry be of one mind with you as to the advisability of your go down to devonshire without delay there be only one provision which must make you certainly must not go alone ""dr mortimer return with i ""but dr. mortimer have his practice to attend to and his house be mile away from yours with all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to help you no sir henry you must take with you someone trusty man who will be always by your side ""is it possible that you could come yourself mr. holmes?""if matter come to crisis should endeavour to be present in person but you can understand that with my extensive consulting practice and with the constant appeal which reach i from many quarter it be impossible for i to be absent from london for an indefinite time at the present instant one of the most revere name in england be be besmirch by blackmailer and only can stop disastrous scandal you will see how impossible it be for i to go to dartmoor ""whom would you recommend then?"holmes lay his hand upon my arm if my friend would undertake it there be no man who be well worth have at your side when you be in tight place no one can say so more confidently than i."the proposition take i completely by surprise but before have time to answer baskerville seize i by the hand and wring it heartily "well now that be real kind of you dr. watson say he you see how it be with i and you know just as much about the matter as do if you will come down to baskerville hall and see i through 'll never forget it "the promise of adventure have always fascination for i and be compliment by the word of holmes and by the eagerness with which the baronet hail i as companion "i will come with pleasure say i. do not know how could employ my time well ""and you will report very carefully to i say holmes when crisis come as it will do will direct how you shall act suppose that by saturday all might be ready?""would that suit dr. watson?""perfectly ""then on saturday unless you hear to the contrary we shall meet at the ten thirty train from paddington "we have rise to depart when baskerville give cry of triumph and diving into one of the corner of the room he draw brown boot from under cabinet "my miss boot he cry "may all our difficulty vanish as easily say sherlock holmes "but it be very singular thing dr. mortimer remark search this room carefully before lunch ""and so do say baskerville every inch of it ""there be certainly no boot in it then ""in that case the waiter must have place it there while we be lunch "the german be send for but profess to know nothing of the matter nor could any inquiry clear it up another item have be add to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mystery which have succeed each other so rapidly set aside the whole grim story of sir charles 's death we have line of inexplicable incident all within the limit of two day which include the receipt of the print letter the black bearded spy in the hansom the loss of the new brown boot the loss of the old black boot and now the return of the new brown boot holme sit in silence in the cab as we drive back to baker street and know from his draw brow and keen face that his mind like my own be busy in endeavour to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnect episode could be fit all afternoon and late into the evening he sat lose in tobacco and thought just before dinner two telegram be hand in the first run have just hear that barrymore be at the hall baskerville.the second visit twenty three hotel as direct but sorry to report unable to trace cut sheet of times cartwright."there go two of my thread watson there be nothing more stimulating than case where everything go against you we must cast round for another scent ""we have still the cabman who drive the spy ""exactly have wire to get his name and address from the official registry should not be surprised if this be an answer to my question "the ring at the bell prove to be something even more satisfactory than an answer however for the door open and rough look fellow enter who be evidently the man himself "i get message from the head office that gent at this address have be inquire for no 2704 say he 've drive my cab this seven year and never word of complaint come here straight from the yard to ask you

tell i that he be detective and that be to say nothing about he to anyone ""my good fellow this be very serious business and you may find yourself in pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from i you say that your fare tell you that he be detective?""yes he do ""when do he say this?""when he leave i ""did he say anything more?""he mention his name "holme cast swift glance of triumph at

wait there until two gentleman come out and take cab from the rank we follow their cab until it pull up somewhere near here ""this very door say holmes "well could n't be sure of that but dare say my fare know all about it we pull up halfway down the street and wait an hour and half then the two gentleman pass we walk and we follow down baker street and along know say holmes "until we get three quarter down regent street then my gentleman throw up the trap and he cry that should drive right away to waterloo station as hard as could go whip up the mare and we be there under the ten minute then he pay up his two guinea like good one and away he go into the station only just as he be leave he turn round and he say it might interest you to know that you have be drive mr. sherlock holmes that be how come to know the name ""i see and you see no more of him?""not after he go into the station ""and how would you describe mr. sherlock holmes?"the cabman scratch his head well he be n't altogether such an easy gentleman to describe 'd put he at forty year of age and he be of middle height two or three inch short than you sir he be dress like toff and he have black beard cut square at the end and pale face do n't know as could say more than that ""colour of his eyes?""no ca n't say that ""nothe more that you can remember?""no sir nothing ""well then here be your half sovereign there be another one wait for you if you can bring any more information good night!""good night sir and thank you!"john clayton depart chuckle and holmes turn to i with shrug of his shoulder and rueful smile "snap go our third thread and we end where we begin say he the cunning rascal he know our number know that sir henry baskerville have consult i spot who be in regent street conjecture that have get the number of the cab and would lay my hand on the driver and so send back this audacious message tell you watson this time we have get foeman who be worthy of our steel 've be checkmate

ready upon the appoint day and we start as arrange for devonshire mr. sherlock holmes drive with i to the station and give i his last parting injunction and advice "i will not bias your mind by suggest theory or suspicion watson say he wish you simply to report fact in the full possible manner to i and you can leave i to do the theorizing ""what sort of fact ask "anything which may seem to have bearing however indirect upon the case and especially the relation between young baskerville and his neighbour or any fresh particular concern the death of sir charles have make some inquiry myself in the last few day but the result have fear be negative one thing only appear to be certain and that be that mr. james desmond who be the next heir be an elderly gentleman of very amiable disposition so that this persecution do not arise from he really think that we may eliminate he entirely from our calculation there remain the people who will actually surround sir henry baskerville upon the moor ""would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this barrymore couple?""by no mean you could not make great mistake if they be innocent it would be cruel injustice and if they be guilty we should be give up all chance of bring it home to they no no we will preserve they upon our list of suspect then there be groom at the hall if remember right there be two moorland farmer there be our friend dr. mortimer whom believe to be entirely honest and there be his wife of whom we know nothing there be this naturalist stapleton and there be his sister who be say to be young lady of attraction there be mr. frankland of lafter hall who be also an unknown factor and there be one or two other neighbour these be the folk who must be your very special study ""i will do my good ""you have arm suppose?""yes think it as well to take they ""most certainly keep your revolver near you night and day and never relax your precaution "our friend have already secure first class carriage and be wait for we upon the platform "no we have no news of any kind say dr. mortimer in answer to my friend 's question can swear to one thing and that be that we have not be shadow during the last two day we have never go out without keep sharp watch and no one could have escape our notice ""you have always keep together presume?""except yesterday afternoon usually give up one day to pure amusement when come to town so spend it at the museum of the college of surgeons ""and go to look at the folk in the park say baskerville "but we have no trouble of any kind ""it be imprudent all the same say holmes shake his head and look very grave beg sir henry that you will not go about alone some great misfortune will befall you if you do do you get your other boot?""no sir it be go forever ""indeed that be very interesting well good bye he add as the train begin to glide down the platform bear in mind sir henry one of the phrase in that queer old legend which dr. mortimer have read to we and avoid the moor in those hour of darkness when the power of evil be exalted "i look back at the platform when we have leave it far behind and see the tall austere figure of holmes stand motionless and gaze after we the journey be swift and pleasant one and spend it in make the more intimate acquaintance of my two companion and in play with dr. mortimer 's spaniel in very few hour the brown earth have become ruddy the brick have change to granite and red cow graze in well hedge field where the lush grass and more luxuriant vegetation speak of rich if damper climate young baskerville stare eagerly out of the window and cry aloud with delight as he recognize the familiar feature of the devon scenery "i've be over good part of the world since leave it dr. watson say he but have never see place to compare with it ""i never see devonshire man who do not swear by his county remark "it depend upon the breed of man quite as much as on the county say dr. mortimer glance at our friend here reveal the rounded head of the celt which carry inside it the celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment poor sir charles 's head be of very rare type half gaelic half ivernian in its characteristic but you be very young when you last see baskerville hall be you not?""i be boy in my teen at the time
