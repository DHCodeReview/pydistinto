of my father 's death and have never see the hall for he live in little cottage on the south coast thence go straight to friend in america tell you it be all as new to i as it be to dr. watson and be as keen as possible to see the moor ""are you then your wish be easily grant for there be your first sight of the moor say dr. mortimer point out of the carriage window over the green square of the field and the low curve of wood there rise in the distance gray melancholy hill with strange jagged summit dim and vague in the distance like some fantastic landscape in dream baskerville sit for long time his eye fix upon it and read upon his eager face how much it mean to he this first sight of that strange spot where the man of his blood have hold sway so long and leave their mark so deep there he sit with his tweed suit and his american accent in the corner of prosaic railway carriage and yet as look at his dark and expressive face feel more than ever how true descendant he be of that long line of high blooded fiery and masterful man there be pride valour and strength in his thick brow his sensitive nostril and his large hazel eye if on that forbid moor difficult and dangerous quest should lie before we this be at least comrade for whom one might venture to take risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it the train pull up at small wayside station and we all descend outside beyond the low white fence wagonette with pair of cobs be wait our coming be evidently great event for station master and porter cluster round we to carry out our luggage it be sweet simple country spot but be surprised to observe that by the gate there stand two soldierly man in dark uniform who lean upon their short rifle and glance keenly at we as we pass the coachman hard face gnarl little fellow salute sir henry baskerville and in few minute we be fly swiftly down the broad white road roll pasture land curve upward on either side of we and old gabled house peep out from amid the thick green foliage but behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rise ever dark against the evening sky the long gloomy curve of the moor break by the jagged and sinister hill the wagonette swing round into side road and we curve upward through deep lane wear by century of wheel high bank on either side heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart's tongue fern bronze bracken and mottled bramble gleam in the light of the sink sun still steadily rise we pass over narrow granite bridge and skirt noisy stream which gush swiftly down foam and roar amid the gray boulder both road and stream wind up through valley dense with scrub oak and fir at every turn baskerville give an exclamation of delight look eagerly about he and ask countless question to his eye all seem beautiful but to i tinge of melancholy lie upon the countryside which bear so clearly the mark of the wane year yellow leave carpet the lane and flutter down upon we as we pass the rattle of our wheel die away as we drive through drift of rot vegetation sad gift as it seem to i for nature to throw before the carriage of the return heir of the baskervilles "halloa cry dr. mortimer what be this?"a steep curve of heath clothe land an outlying spur of the moor lie in front of we on the summit hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its pedestal be mount soldier dark and stern his rifle poise ready over his forearm he be watch the road along which we travel "what be this perkins ask dr. mortimer our driver half turn in his seat there be convict escape from princetown sir he be be out three day now and the warder watch every road and every station but they 've have no sight of he yet the farmer about here do n't like it sir and that be fact ""well understand that they get five pound if they can give information ""yes sir but the chance of five pound be but poor thing compare to the chance of have your throat cut you see it be n't like any ordinary convict this be man that would stick at nothing ""who be he then?""it be selden the notting hill murderer "i remember the case well for it be one in which holmes have take an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton brutality which have mark all the action of the assassin the commutation of his death sentence have be due to some doubt as to his complete sanity so atrocious be his conduct our wagonette have top rise and in front of we rise the huge expanse of the moor mottle with gnarled and craggy cairns and tor cold wind sweep down from it and set we shiver somewhere there on that desolate plain be lurk this fiendish man hide in burrow like wild beast his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which have cast he out it need but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste the chilling wind and the darkle sky even baskerville fall silent and pull his overcoat more closely around he we have leave the fertile country behind and beneath we we look back on it now the slanting ray of low sun turn the stream to thread of gold and glow on the red earth new turn by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodland the road in front of we grow bleaker and wilder over huge russet and olive slope sprinkle with giant boulder now and then we pass moorland cottage wall and roof with stone with no creeper to break its harsh outline suddenly we look down into cuplike depression patch with stunted oak and fir which have be twist and bent by the fury of year of storm two high narrow tower rise over the tree the driver point with his whip "baskerville hall say he its master have rise and be stare with flushed cheek and shine eye few minute later we have reach the lodge gate maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron with weather bite pillar on either side blotch with lichen and surmount by the boar head of the baskervilles the lodge be ruin of black granite and bared rib of rafter but face it be new building half construct the first fruit of sir charles 's south african gold through the gateway we pass into the avenue where the wheel be again hush amid the leave and the old tree shoot their branch in sombre tunnel over our head baskerville shudder as he look up the long dark drive to where the house glimmer like ghost at the farther end "was it here he ask in low voice "no no the yew alley be on the other side "the young heir glanced round with gloomy face "it be no wonder my uncle feel as if trouble be come on he in such place as this say he it be enough to scare any man 'll have row of electric lamp up here inside of six month and you wo n't know it again with thousand candle power swan and edison right here in front of the hall door "the avenue open into broad expanse of turf and the house lie before we in the fade light could see that the centre be heavy block of building from which porch project the whole front be drape in ivy with patch clip bare here and there where window or coat of arm break through the dark veil from this central block rise the twin tower ancient crenelate and pierce with many loophole to right and leave of the turret be more modern wing of black granite dull light shine through heavy mullione window and from the high chimney which rise from the steep high angle roof there spring single black column of smoke "welcome sir henry welcome to baskerville hall!"a tall man have step from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonette the figure of woman be silhouette against the yellow light of the hall she come out and help the man to hand down our bag "you do n't mind my drive straight home sir henry say dr. mortimer my wife be expect i ""surely you will stay and have some dinner?""no must go shall probably find some work await i would stay to show you over the house but barrymore will be well guide than i. good bye and never hesitate night or day to send for i if can be of service "the wheel die away down the drive while sir henry and turn into the hall and the door clang heavily behind we it be fine apartment in which we find ourselves large lofty and heavily rafter with huge baulk of age blacken oak in the great old fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dog log fire crackle and snap sir henry and hold out our hand to it for we be numb from our long drive then we gaze round we at the high thin window of old stained glass the oak panelling the stag head the coat of arm upon the wall all dim and sombre in the subdue light of the central lamp "it be just as imagine it say sir henry be it not the very picture of an old family home to think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred year my people have live it strike i solemn to think of it "i see his dark face light up with boyish enthusiasm as he gaze about he the light beat upon he where he stand but long shadow trail down the wall and hang like black canopy above he barrymore have return from take our luggage to our room he stand in front of we now with the subdue manner of well train servant he be remarkable look man tall handsome with square black beard and pale distinguished feature "would you wish dinner to be serve at once sir?""is it ready?""in very few minute sir you will find hot water in your room my wife and will be happy sir henry to stay with you until you have make your fresh arrangement but you will understand that under the new condition this house will require considerable staff ""what new conditions?""i only mean sir that sir charles lead very retired life and we be able to look after his want you would naturally wish to have more company and so you will need change in your household ""do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?""only when it be quite convenient to you sir ""but your family have be with we for several generation have they not should be sorry to begin my life here by break an old family connection "i seem to discern some sign of emotion upon the butler 's white face "i feel that also sir and so do my wife but to tell the truth sir we be both very much attached to sir charles and his death give we shock and make these surrounding very painful to we fear that we shall never again be easy in our mind at baskerville hall ""but what do you intend to do?""i have no doubt sir that we shall succeed in establish ourselves in some business sir charles 's generosity have give we the mean to do so and now sir perhaps have good show you to your room "a square balustrade gallery run round the top of the old hall approach by double stair from this central point two long corridor extend the whole length of the building from which all the bedroom open my own be in the same wing as baskerville 's and almost next door to it these room appear to be much more modern than the central part of the house and the bright paper and numerous candle do something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival have leave upon my mind but the dining room which open out of the hall be place of shadow and gloom it be long chamber with step separate the dai where the family sit from the low portion reserve for their dependent at one end minstrel 's gallery overlook it black beam shoot across above our head with smoke darken ceiling beyond they with row of flaring torch to light it up and the colour and rude hilarity of an old time banquet it might have soften but now when two black clothe gentleman sit in the little circle of light throw by shaded lamp one 's voice become hush and one 's spirit subdue dim line of ancestor in every variety of dress from the elizabethan knight to the buck of the regency stare down upon we and daunt we by their silent company we talk little and for one be glad when the meal be over and we be able to retire into the modern billiard room and smoke cigarette "my word it be n't very cheerful place say sir henry suppose one can tone down to it but feel bit out of the picture at present do n't wonder that my uncle get little jumpy if he live all alone in such house as this however if it suit you we will retire early tonight and perhaps thing may seem more cheerful in the morning "i draw aside my curtain before go to bed and look out from my window it open upon the grassy space which lie in front of the hall door beyond two copse of tree moan and swing in rise wind half moon break through the rift of race cloud in its cold light see beyond the tree broken fringe of rock and the long low curve of the melancholy moor close the curtain feel that my last impression be in keep with the rest and yet it be not quite the last find myself weary and yet wakeful toss restlessly from side to side seek for the sleep which would not come far away chiming clock strike out the quarter of the hour but otherwise deathly silence lie upon the old house and then suddenly in the very dead of the night there come sound to my ear clear resonant and unmistakable it be the sob of woman the muffled strangle gasp of one who be tear by an uncontrollable sorrow sit up in bed and listen intently the noise could not have be far away and be certainly in the house for half an hour wait with every nerve on the alert but there come no other sound save the chime clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall the fresh beauty of the following morning do something to efface from our mind the grim and gray impression which have be leave upon both of we by our first experience of baskerville hall as sir henry and sit at breakfast the sunlight flood in through the high mullione window throw watery patch of colour from the coat of arm which cover they the dark panelling glow like bronze in the golden ray and it be hard to realize that this be indeed the chamber which have strike such gloom into our soul upon the evening before "i guess it be ourselves and not the house that we have to blame say the baronet we be tired with our journey and chill by our drive so we take gray view of the place now we be fresh and well so it be all cheerful once more ""and yet it be not entirely question of imagination answer do you for example happen to hear someone woman think sob in the night?""that be curious for do when be half asleep fancy that hear something of the sort wait quite time but there be no more of it so conclude that it be all dream ""i hear it distinctly and be sure that it be really the sob of woman ""we must ask about this right away he ring the bell and ask barrymore whether he could account for our experience it seem to i that the pallid feature of the butler turn shade paler still as he listen to his master 's question "there be only two woman in the house sir henry he answer one be the scullery maid who sleep in the other wing the other be my wife and can answer for it that the sound could not have come from she "and yet he lie as he say it for it chance that after breakfast meet mrs. barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face she be large impassive heavy feature woman with stern set expression of mouth but her telltale eye be red and glance at i from between swollen lid it be she then who weep in the night and if she do so her husband must know it yet he have take the obvious risk of discovery in declare that it be not so why have he do this and why do she weep so bitterly already round this pale faced handsome black bearded man there be gather an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom it be he who have be the first to discover the body of sir charles and we have only his word for all the circumstance which lead up to the old man 's death be it possible that it be barrymore after all whom we have see in the cab in regent street the beard might well have be the same the cabman have describe somewhat short man but such an impression might easily have be erroneous how could settle the point forever obviously the first thing to do be to see the grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram have really be place in barrymore 's own hand be the answer what it might should at least have something to report to sherlock holmes sir henry have numerous paper to examine after breakfast so that the time be propitious for my excursion it be pleasant walk of four mile along the edge of the moor lead i at last to small gray hamlet in which two large building which prove to be the inn and the house of dr. mortimer stand high above the rest the postmaster who be also the village grocer have clear recollection of the telegram "certainly sir say he have the telegram deliver to mr. barrymore exactly as direct ""who deliver it?""my boy here james you deliver that telegram to mr. barrymore at the hall last week do you not?""yes father deliver it ""into his own hand ask "well he be up in the loft at the time so that could not put it into his own hand but give it into mrs. barrymore 's hand and she promise to deliver it at once ""did you see mr. barrymore?""no sir tell you he be in the loft ""if you do n't see he how do you know he be in the loft?""well surely his own wife ought to know where he be say the postmaster testily do n't he get the telegram if there be any mistake it be for mr. barrymore himself to complain "it seem hopeless to pursue the inquiry any far but it be clear that in spite of holmes 's ruse we have no proof that barrymore have not be in london all the time suppose that it be so suppose that the same man have be the last who have see sir charles alive and the first to dog the new heir when he return to england what then be he the agent of other or have he some sinister design of his own what interest could he have in persecute the baskerville family think of the strange warning clip out of the lead article of the times be that his work or be it possibly the doing of someone who be bent upon counteract his scheme the only conceivable motive be that which have be suggest by sir henry that if the family could be scare away comfortable and permanent home would be secure for the barrymores but surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep and subtle scheming which seem to be weave an invisible net round the young baronet holme himself have say that no more complex case have come to he in all the long series of his sensational investigation pray as walk back along the gray lonely road that my friend might soon be free from his preoccupation and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulder suddenly my thought be interrupt by the sound of run foot behind i and by voice which call i by name turn expect to see dr. mortimer but to my surprise it be stranger who be pursue i he be small slim clean shaven prim face man flaxen haired and leanjawe between thirty and forty year of age dress in gray suit and wear straw hat tin box for botanical specimen hang over his shoulder and he carry green butterfly net in one of his hand "you will be sure excuse my presumption dr. watson say he as he came pant up to where stand here on the moor we be homely folk and do not wait for formal introduction you may possibly have hear my name from our mutual friend mortimer be stapleton of merripit house ""your net and box would have tell i as much say for know that mr. stapleton be naturalist but how do you know me?""i have be call on mortimer and he point you out to i from the window of his surgery as you pass as our road lie the same way think that would overtake you and introduce myself trust that sir henry be none the bad for his journey?""he be very well thank you ""we be all rather afraid that after the sad death of sir charles the new baronet might refuse to live here it be ask much of wealthy man to come down and bury himself in place of this kind but need not tell you that it mean very great deal to the countryside sir henry have suppose no superstitious fear in the matter?""i do not think that it be likely ""of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunt the family?""i have hear it ""it be extraordinary how credulous the peasant be about here any number of they be ready to swear that they have see such creature upon the moor he speak with smile but seem to read in his eye that he take the matter more seriously the story take great hold upon the imagination of sir charles and have no doubt that it lead to his tragic end ""but how?""his nerve be so work up that the appearance of any dog might have have fatal effect upon his diseased heart fancy that he really do see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley fear that some disaster might occur for be very fond of the old man and know that his heart be weak ""how do you know that?""my friend mortimer tell i ""you think then that some dog pursue sir charles and that he die of fright in consequence?""have you any well explanation?""i have not come to any conclusion ""has mr. sherlock holmes?"the word take away my breath for an instant but glance at the placid face and steadfast eye of my companion show that no surprise be intend "it be useless for we to pretend that we do not know you dr. watson say he the record of your detective have reach we here and you could not celebrate he without be know yourself when mortimer tell i your name he could not deny your identity if you be here then it follow that mr. sherlock holmes be interesting himself in the matter and be naturally curious to know what view he may take ""i be afraid that can not answer that question ""may ask if he be go to honour we with visit himself?""he can not leave town at present he have other case which engage his attention ""what pity he might throw some light on that which be so dark to we but as to your own research if there be any possible way in which can be of service to you trust that you will command i if have any indication of the nature of your suspicion or how you propose to investigate the case might perhaps even now give
