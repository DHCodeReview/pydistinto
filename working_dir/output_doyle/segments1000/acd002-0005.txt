you some aid or advice ""i assure you that be simply here upon visit to my friend sir henry and that need no help of any kind ""excellent say stapleton you be perfectly right to be wary and discreet be justly reprove for what feel be an unjustifiable intrusion and promise you that will not mention the matter again "we have come to point where narrow grassy path strike off from the road and wound away across the moor steep boulder sprinkle hill lie upon the right which have in bygone day be cut into granite quarry the face which be turn towards we form dark cliff with fern and bramble grow in its niche from over distant rise there float gray plume of smoke "a moderate walk along this moor path bring we to merripit house say he perhaps you will spare an hour that may have the pleasure of introduce you to my sister "my first thought be that should be by sir henry 's side but then remember the pile of paper and bill with which his study table be litter it be certain that could not help with those and holmes have expressly say that should study the neighbour upon the moor accept stapleton 's invitation and we turn together down the path "it be wonderful place the moor say he look round over the undulating down long green roller with crest of jagged granite foam up into fantastic surge you never tire of the moor you can not think the wonderful secret which it contain it be so vast and so barren and so mysterious ""you know it well then?""i have only be here two year the resident would call i newcomer we come shortly after sir charles settle but my taste lead i to explore every part of the country round and should think that there be few man who know it well than do ""is it hard to know?""very hard you see for example this great plain to the north here with the queer hill break out of it do you observe anything remarkable about that?""it would be rare place for gallop ""you would naturally think so and the thought have cost several their life before now you notice those bright green spot scatter thickly over it?""yes they seem more fertile than the rest "stapleton laugh that be the great grimpen mire say he false step yonder mean death to man or beast only yesterday see one of the moor pony wander into it he never come out see his head for quite long time crane out of the bog hole but it suck he down at last even in dry season it be danger to cross it but after these autumn rain it be an awful place and yet can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive by george there be another of those miserable ponies!"something brown be roll and toss among the green sedge then long agonize writhe neck shoot upward and dreadful cry echo over the moor it turn i cold with horror but my companion 's nerve seem to be strong than mine "it be go say he the mire have he two in two day and many more perhaps for they get in the way of go there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire have they in its clutch it be bad place the great grimpen mire ""and you say you can penetrate it?""yes there be one or two path which very active man can take have find they out ""but why should you wish to go into so horrible place?""well you see the hill beyond they be really island cut off on all side by the impassable mire which have crawl round they in the course of year that be where the rare plant and the butterfly be if you have the wit to reach they ""i shall try my luck some day "he look at i with surprised face for god 's sake put such an idea out of your mind say he your blood would be upon my head assure you that there would not be the least chance of your come back alive it be only by remember certain complex landmark that be able to do it ""halloa cry what be that?"a long low moan indescribably sad sweep over the moor it fill the whole air and yet it be impossible to say whence it come from dull murmur it swell into deep roar and then sink back into melancholy throb murmur once again stapleton look at i with curious expression in his face "queer place the moor say he "but what be it?""the peasant say it be the hound of the baskervilles call for its prey 've hear it once or twice before but never quite so loud "i look round with chill of fear in my heart at the huge swell plain mottle with the green patch of rush nothing stir over the vast expanse save pair of raven which croak loudly from tor behind we "you be an educate man you do n't believe such nonsense as that say i. what do you think be the cause of so strange sound?""bog make queer noise sometimes it be the mud settling or the water rise or something ""no no that be live voice ""well perhaps it be do you ever hear bittern booming?""no never do ""it be very rare bird practically extinct in england now but all thing be possible upon the moor yes should not be surprised to learn that what we have hear be the cry of the last of the bittern ""it be the weird strange thing that ever hear in my life ""yes it be rather an uncanny place altogether look at the hillside yonder what do you make of those?"the whole steep slope be cover with gray circular ring of stone score of they at least "what be they sheep pens?""no they be the home of our worthy ancestor prehistoric man live thickly on the moor and as no one in particular have live there since we find all his little arrangement exactly as he leave they these be his wigwam with the roof off you can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside "but it be quite town when be it inhabited?""neolithic man no date ""what do he do?""he graze his cattle on these slope and he learn to dig for tin when the bronze sword begin to supersede the stone axe look at the great trench in the opposite hill that be his mark yes you will find some very singular point about the moor dr. watson oh excuse i an instant it be surely cyclopides "a small fly or moth have flutter across our path and in an instant stapleton be rush with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it to my dismay the creature fly straight for the great mire and my acquaintance never pause for an instant bound from tuft to tuft behind it his green net wave in the air his gray clothe and jerky zigzag irregular progress make he not unlike some huge moth himself be stand watch his pursuit with mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire when hear the sound of step and turn round find woman near i upon the path she have come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicate the position of merripit house but the dip of the moor have hide she until she be quite close could not doubt that this be the miss stapleton of whom have be tell since lady of any sort must be few upon the moor and remember that have hear someone describe she as be beauty the woman who approach i be certainly that and of most uncommon type there could not have be great contrast between brother and sister for stapleton be neutral tint with light hair and gray eye while she be dark than any brunette whom have see in england slim elegant and tall she have proud finely cut face so regular that it might have seem impassive be it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark eager eye with her perfect figure and elegant dress she be indeed strange apparition upon lonely moorland path her eye be on her brother as turn and then she quicken her pace towards i have raise my hat and be about to make some explanatory remark when her own word turn all my thought into new channel "go back she say go straight back to london instantly "i could only stare at she in stupid surprise her eye blaze at i and she tap the ground impatiently with her foot "why should go back ask "i can not explain she speak in low eager voice with curious lisp in her utterance but for god 's sake do what ask you go back and never set foot upon the moor again ""but have only just come ""man man she cry can you not tell when warning be for your own good go back to london start tonight get away from this place at all cost hush my brother be come not word of what have say would you mind get that orchid for i among the mare's tail yonder we be very rich in orchid on the moor though of course you be rather late to see the beauty of the place "stapleton have abandon the chase and come back to we breathe hard and flush with his exertion "halloa beryl say he and it seem to i that the tone of his greeting be not altogether cordial one "well jack you be very hot ""yes be chase cyclopides he be very rare and seldom find in the late autumn what pity that should have miss he he speak unconcernedly but his small light eye glance incessantly from the girl to i "you have introduce yourself can see ""yes be tell sir henry that it be rather late for he to see the true beauty of the moor ""why who do you think this is?""i imagine that it must be sir henry baskerville ""no no say i. only humble commoner but his friend my name be dr. watson "a flush of vexation pass over her expressive face we have be talk at cross purpose say she "why you have not very much time for talk her brother remark with the same questioning eye "i talk as if dr. watson be resident instead of be merely visitor say she it can not much matter to he whether it be early or late for the orchid but you will come on will you not and see merripit house?"a short walk bring we to it bleak moorland house once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous day but now put into repair and turn into modern dwelling an orchard surround it but the tree as be usual upon the moor be stunt and nip and the effect of the whole place be mean and melancholy we be admit by strange wizene rusty coat old manservant who seem in keep with the house inside however there be large room furnish with an elegance in which seem to recognize the taste of the lady as look from their window at the interminable granite flecked moor rolling unbroken to the farth horizon could not but marvel at what could have bring this highly educate man and this beautiful woman to live in such place "queer spot to choose be it not say he as if in answer to my thought and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy do we not beryl?""quite happy say she but there be no ring of conviction in her word "i have school say stapleton it be in the north country the work to man of my temperament be mechanical and uninteresting but the privilege of live with youth of help to mould those young mind and of impress they with one 's own character and ideal be very dear to i however the fate be against we serious epidemic break out in the school and three of the boy die it never recover from the blow and much of my capital be irretrievably swallow up and yet if it be not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boy could rejoice over my own misfortune for with my strong taste for botany and zoology find an unlimited field of work here and my sister be as devoted to nature as be all this dr. watson have be bring upon your head by your expression as you survey the moor out of our window ""it certainly do cross my mind that it might be little dull less for you perhaps than for your sister ""no no be never dull say she quickly "we have book we have our study and we have interesting neighbour dr. mortimer be most learn man in his own line poor sir charles be also an admirable companion we know he well and miss he more than can tell do you think that should intrude if be to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of sir henry?""i be sure that he would be delighted ""then perhaps you would mention that propose to do so we may in our humble way do something to make thing more easy for he until he become accustomed to his new surrounding will you come upstairs dr. watson and inspect my collection of lepidoptera think it be the most complete one in the south west of england by the time that you have look through they lunch will be almost ready "but be eager to get back to my charge the melancholy of the moor the death of the unfortunate pony the weird sound which have be associate with the grim legend of the baskervilles all these thing tinge my thought with sadness then on the top of these more or less vague impression there have come the definite and distinct warning of miss stapleton deliver with such intense earnestness that could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lie behind it resist all pressure to stay for lunch and set off at once upon my return journey take the grass grow path by which we have come it seem however that there must have be some short cut for those who know it for before have reach the road be astounded to see miss stapleton sit upon rock by the side of the track her face be beautifully flush with her exertion and she hold her hand to her side "i have run all the way in order to cut you off dr. watson say she have not even time to put on my hat must not stop or my brother may miss i want to say to you how sorry be about the stupid mistake make in think that you be sir henry please forget the word say which have no application whatever to you ""but ca n't forget they miss stapleton say i. be sir henry 's friend and his welfare be very close concern of mine tell i why it be that you be so eager that sir henry should return to london ""a woman 's whim dr. watson when you know i well you will understand that can not always give reason for what say or do ""no no remember the thrill in your voice remember the look in your eye please please be frank with i miss stapleton for ever since have be here have be conscious of shadow all round i life have become like that great grimpen mire with little green patch everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track tell i then what it be that you mean and will promise to convey your warning to sir henry "an expression of irresolution pass for an instant over her face but her eye have harden again when she answer i "you make too much of it dr. watson say she my brother and be very much shock by the death of sir charles we know he very intimately for his favourite walk be over the moor to our house he be deeply impressed with the curse which hang over the family and when this tragedy come naturally feel that there must be some ground for the fear which he have express be distressed therefore when another member of the family come down to live here and feel that he should be warn of the danger which he will run that be all which intend to convey "but what be the danger?""you know the story of the hound?""i do not believe in such nonsense ""but do if you have any influence with sir henry take he away from place which have always be fatal to his family the world be wide why should he wish to live at the place of danger?""because it be the place of danger that be sir henry 's nature fear that unless you can give i some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get he to move ""i can not say anything definite for do not know anything definite ""i would ask you one more question miss stapleton if you mean no more than this when you first speak to i why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you say there be nothing to which he or anyone else could object ""my brother be very anxious to have the hall inhabit for he think it be for the good of the poor folk upon the moor he would be very angry if he know that have say anything which might induce sir henry to go away but have do my duty now and will say no more must go back or he will miss i and suspect that have see you good bye she turn and have disappear in few minute among the scatter boulder while with my soul full of vague fear pursue my way to baskerville hall from this point onward will follow the course of event by transcribe my own letter to mr. sherlock holmes which lie before i on the table one page be miss but otherwise they be exactly as write and show my feeling and suspicion of the moment more accurately than my memory clear as it be upon these tragic event can possibly do baskerville hall october 13th my dear holmes my previous letter and telegram have keep you pretty well up to date as to all that have occur in this most god forsake corner of the world the long one stay here the more do the spirit of the moor sink into one 's soul its vastness and also its grim charm when you be once out upon its bosom you have leave all trace of modern england behind you but on the other hand you be conscious everywhere of the home and the work of the prehistoric people on all side of you as you walk be the house of these forget folk with their grave and the huge monolith which be suppose to have mark their temple as you look at their gray stone hut against the scarred hillside you leave your own age behind you and if you be to see skin clothe hairy man crawl out from the low door fit flint tip arrow on to the string of his bow you would feel that his presence there be more natural than your own the strange thing be that they should have live so thickly on what must always have be most unfruitful soil be no antiquarian but could imagine that they be some unwarlike and harry race who be force to accept that which none other would occupy all this however be foreign to the mission on which you send i and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun move round the earth or the earth round the sun let i therefore return to the fact concern sir henry baskerville if you have not have any report within the last few day it be because up to today there be nothing of importance to relate then very surprising circumstance occur which shall tell you in due course but first of all must keep you in touch with some of the other factor in the situation one of these concern which have say little be the escape convict upon the moor there be strong reason now to believe that he have get right away which be considerable relief to the lonely householder of this district fortnight have pass since his flight during which he have not be see and nothing have be hear of he it be surely inconceivable that he could have hold out upon the moor during all that time of course so far as his concealment go there be no difficulty at all any one of these stone hut would give he hiding place but there be nothing to eat unless he be to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep we think therefore that he have go and the outlying farmer sleep the well in consequence we be four able bodied man in this household so that we could take good care of ourselves but confess that have have uneasy moment when have think of the stapletons they live mile from any help there be one maid an old manservant the sister and the brother the latter not very strong man they would be helpless in the hand of desperate fellow like this notting hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance both sir henry and be concern at their situation and it be suggest that perkins the groom should go over to sleep there but stapleton would not hear of it the fact be that our friend the baronet begin to display considerable interest in our fair neighbour it be not to be wonder at for time hang heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like he and she be very fascinating and beautiful woman there be something tropical and exotic about she which form singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother yet he also give the idea of hide fire he have certainly very marked influence over she for have see her continually glance at he as she talk as if seek approbation for what she say trust that he be kind to she there be dry glitter in his eye and firm set of his thin lip which go with positive and possibly harsh nature you would find he an interesting study he come over to call upon baskerville on that first day and the very next morning he take we both to show we the spot where the legend of the wicked hugo be suppose to have have its origin it be an excursion of some mile across the moor to place which be so dismal that it might have suggest the story we find short valley between rugged tor which lead to an open grassy space fleck over with the white cotton grass in the middle of it rise two great stone wear and sharpen at the upper end until they look like the huge corroding fang of some monstrous beast in every way it correspond with the scene of the old tragedy sir henry be much interested and ask stapleton more than once whether he do really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affair of man he speak lightly but it be evident that he be very much in earnest stapleton be guard in his reply but it be easy to see that he say less than he might and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feeling of the baronet he tell we of similar case where family have suffer from some evil influence and he leave we with the impression that he share the popular view upon the matter on our way back we stay for lunch at merripit house and it be there that sir henry make the acquaintance of miss stapleton from the first moment that he see she he appear to be strongly attract by she and be much mistaken if the feeling be not mutual he refer to she again and again on our walk home and since then hardly day have pass that we have not see something of the brother and sister they dine here tonight and there be some talk of our go to they next week one would imagine that such match would be very welcome to stapleton and yet have more than once catch look of the strong disapprobation in his face when sir henry have be pay some attention to his
