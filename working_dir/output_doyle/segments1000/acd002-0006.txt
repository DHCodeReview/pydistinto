sister he be much attached to she no doubt and would lead lonely life without she but it would seem the height of selfishness if he be to stand in the way of she make so brilliant marriage yet be certain that he do not wish their intimacy to ripen into love and have several time observe that he have take pain to prevent they from be tete tete by the way your instruction to i never to allow sir henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if love affair be to be add to our other difficulty my popularity would soon suffer if be to carry out your order to the letter the other day thursday to be more exact dr. mortimer lunch with we he have be excavate barrow at long down and have get prehistoric skull which fill he with great joy never be there such single minded enthusiast as he the stapletons come in afterwards and the good doctor take we all to the yew alley at sir henry 's request to show we exactly how everything occur upon that fatal night it be long dismal walk the yew alley between two high wall of clipped hedge with narrow band of grass upon either side at the far end be an old tumble down summer house halfway down be the moor gate where the old gentleman leave his cigar ash it be white wooden gate with latch beyond it lie the wide moor remember your theory of the affair and try to picture all that have occur as the old man stand there he see something come across the moor something which terrify he so that he lose his wit and run and run until he die of sheer horror and exhaustion there be the long gloomy tunnel down which he flee and from what sheep dog of the moor or spectral hound black silent and monstrous be there human agency in the matter do the pale watchful barrymore know more than he care to say it be all dim and vague but always there be the dark shadow of crime behind it one other neighbour have meet since write last this be mr. frankland of lafter hall who live some four mile to the south of we he be an elderly man red faced white haired and choleric his passion be for the british law and he have spend large fortune in litigation he fight for the mere pleasure of fighting and be equally ready to take up either side of question so that it be no wonder that he have find it costly amusement sometimes he will shut up right of way and defy the parish to make he open it at other he will with his own hand tear down some other man 's gate and declare that path have exist there from time immemorial defy the owner to prosecute he for trespass he be learn in old manorial and communal right and he apply his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villager of fernworthy and sometimes against they so that he be periodically either carry in triumph down the village street or else burn in effigy accord to his late exploit he be say to have about seven lawsuit upon his hand at present which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his sting and leave he harmless for the future apart from the law he seem kindly good natured person and only mention he because you be particular that should send some description of the people who surround we he be curiously employ at present for be an amateur astronomer he have an excellent telescope with which he lie upon the roof of his own house and sweep the moor all day in the hope of catch glimpse of the escaped convict if he would confine his energy to this all would be well but there be rumour that he intend to prosecute dr. mortimer for open grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dig up the neolithic skull in the barrow on long down he help to keep our life from be monotonous and give little comic relief where it be badly need and now having bring you up to date in the escaped convict the stapletons dr. mortimer and frankland of lafter hall let i end on that which be most important and tell you more about the barrymores and especially about the surprising development of last night first of all about the test telegram which you send from london in order to make sure that barrymore be really here have already explain that the testimony of the postmaster show that the test be worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other tell sir henry how the matter stand and he at once in his downright fashion have barrymore up and ask he whether he have receive the telegram himself barrymore say that he have "did the boy deliver it into your own hand ask sir henry barrymore look surprised and consider for little time "no say he be in the box room at the time and my wife bring it up to i ""did you answer it yourself?""no tell my wife what to answer and she go down to write it "in the evening he recur to the subject of his own accord "i could not quite understand the object of your question this morning sir henry say he trust that they do not mean that have do anything to forfeit your confidence?"sir henry have to assure he that it be not so and pacify he by give he considerable part of his old wardrobe the london outfit having now all arrive mrs. barrymore be of interest to i she be heavy solid person very limited intensely respectable and incline to be puritanical you could hardly conceive less emotional subject yet have tell you how on the first night here hear she sob bitterly and since then have more than once observe trace of tear upon her face some deep sorrow gnaw ever at her heart sometimes wonder if she have guilty memory which haunt she and sometimes suspect barrymore of be domestic tyrant have always feel that there be something singular and questionable in this man 's character but the adventure of last night bring all my suspicion to head and yet it may seem small matter in itself you be aware that be not very sound sleeper and since have be on guard in this house my slumber have be light than ever last night about two in the morning be arouse by stealthy step pass my room rise open my door and peep out long black shadow be trail down the corridor it be throw by man who walk softly down the passage with candle hold in his hand he be in shirt and trouser with no covering to his foot could merely see the outline but his height tell i that it be barrymore he walk very slowly and circumspectly and there be something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance have tell you that the corridor be break by the balcony which run round the hall but that it be resume upon the farther side wait until he have pass out of sight and then follow he when come round the balcony he have reach the end of the farther corridor and could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he have enter one of the room now all these room be unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition become more mysterious than ever the light shine steadily as if he be stand motionless creep down the passage as noiselessly as could and peep round the corner of the door barrymore be crouch at the window with the candle hold against the glass his profile be half turn towards i and his face seem to be rigid with expectation as he stare out into the blackness of the moor for some minute he stand watch intently then he give deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light instantly make my way back to my room and very shortly come the stealthy step pass once more upon their return journey long afterwards when have fall into light sleep hear key turn somewhere in lock but could not tell whence the sound come what it all mean can not guess but there be some secret business go on in this house of gloom which soon or later we shall get to the bottom of do not trouble you with my theory for you ask i to furnish you only with fact have have long talk with sir henry this morning and we have make plan of campaign found upon my observation of last night will not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interesting reading baskerville hall oct. 15th my dear holmes if be compel to leave you without much news during the early day of my mission you must acknowledge that be make up for lost time and that event be now crowd thick and fast upon we in my last report end upon my top note with barrymore at the window and now have quite budget already which will unless be much mistaken considerably surprise you thing have take turn which could not have anticipate in some way they have within the last forty eight hour become much clear and in some way they have become more complicated but will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself before breakfast on the morning follow my adventure go down the corridor and examine the room in which barrymore have be on the night before the western window through which he have stare so intently have notice one peculiarity above all other window in the house it command the near outlook on to the moor there be an opening between two tree which enable one from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other window it be only distant glimpse which can be obtain it follow therefore that barrymore since only this window would serve the purpose must have be look out for something or somebody upon the moor the night be very dark so that can hardly imagine how he could have hope to see anyone it have strike i that it be possible that some love intrigue be on foot that would have account for his stealthy movement and also for the uneasiness of his wife the man be striking look fellow very well equipped to steal the heart of country girl so that this theory seem to have something to support it that opening of the door which have hear after have return to my room might mean that he have go out to keep some clandestine appointment so reason with myself in the morning and tell you the direction of my suspicion however much the result may have show that they be unfounded but whatever the true explanation of barrymore 's movement might be feel that the responsibility of keep they to myself until could explain they be more than could bear have an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and tell he all that have see he be less surprised than have expect "i know that barrymore walk about night and have mind to speak to he about it say he two or three time have hear his step in the passage come and go just about the hour you name ""perhaps then he pay visit every night to that particular window suggest "perhap he do if so we should be able to shadow he and see what it be that he be after wonder what your friend holmes would do if he be here ""i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest say i. he would follow barrymore and see what he do ""then we shall do it together ""but surely he would hear we ""the man be rather deaf and in any case we must take our chance of that we 'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he pass sir henry rub his hand with pleasure and it be evident that he hail the adventure as relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor the baronet have be in communication with the architect who prepare the plan for sir charles and with contractor from london so that we may expect great change to begin here soon there have be decorator and furnisher up from plymouth and it be evident that our friend have large idea and mean to spare no pain or expense to restore the grandeur of his family when the house be renovate and refurnish all that he will need will be wife to make it complete between ourselves there be pretty clear sign that this will not be want if the lady be willing for have seldom see man more infatuate with woman than he be with our beautiful neighbour miss stapleton and yet the course of true love do not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstance expect today for example its surface be break by very unexpected ripple which have cause our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance after the conversation which have quote about barrymore sir henry put on his hat and prepare to go out as matter of course do the same "what be you come watson he ask look at i in curious way "that depend on whether you be go on the moor say i."yes be ""well you know what my instruction be be sorry to intrude but you hear how earnestly holmes insist that should not leave you and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor "sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with pleasant smile "my dear fellow say he holmes with all his wisdom do not foresee some thing which have happen since have be on the moor you understand i be sure that you be the last man in the world who would wish to be spoil sport must go out alone "it put i in most awkward position be at loss what to say or what to do and before have make up my mind he pick up his cane and be go but when come to think the matter over my conscience reproach i bitterly for have on any pretext allow he to go out of my sight imagine what my feeling would be if have to return to you and to confess that some misfortune have occur through my disregard for your instruction assure you my cheek flush at the very thought it might not even now be too late to overtake he so set off at once in the direction of merripit house hurry along the road at the top of my speed without see anything of sir henry until come to the point where the moor path branch off there fear that perhaps have come in the wrong direction after all mount hill from which could command view the same hill which be cut into the dark quarry thence see he at once he be on the moor path about quarter of mile off and lady be by his side who could only be miss stapleton it be clear that there be already an understanding between they and that they have meet by appointment they be walk slowly along in deep conversation and see she make quick little movement of her hand as if she be very earnest in what she be say while he listen intently and once or twice shake his head in strong dissent stand among the rock watch they very much puzzle as to what should do next to follow they and break into their intimate conversation seem to be an outrage and yet my clear duty be never for an instant to let he out of my sight to act the spy upon friend be hateful task still could see no well course than to observe he from the hill and to clear my conscience by confess to he afterwards what have do it be true that if any sudden danger have threaten he be too far away to be of use and yet be sure that you will agree with i that the position be very difficult and that there be nothing more which could do our friend sir henry and the lady have halt on the path and be standing deeply absorb in their conversation when be suddenly aware that be not the only witness of their interview wisp of green float in the air catch my eye and another glance show i that it be carry on stick by man who be move among the broken ground it be stapleton with his butterfly net he be very much close to the pair than be and he appear to be move in their direction at this instant sir henry suddenly draw miss stapleton to his side his arm be round she but it seem to i that she be strain away from he with her face avert he stoop his head to hers and she raise one hand as if in protest next moment see they spring apart and turn hurriedly round stapleton be the cause of the interruption he be run wildly towards they his absurd net dangle behind he he gesticulate and almost dance with excitement in front of the lover what the scene mean could not imagine but it seem to i that stapleton be abuse sir henry who offer explanation which become more angry as the other refuse to accept they the lady stand by in haughty silence finally stapleton turn upon his heel and beckon in peremptory way to his sister who after an irresolute glance at sir henry walk off by the side of her brother the naturalist 's angry gesture show that the lady be include in his displeasure the baronet stand for minute look after they and then he walk slowly back the way that he have come his head hang the very picture of dejection what all this mean could not imagine but be deeply ashamed to have witness so intimate scene without my friend 's knowledge run down the hill therefore and meet the baronet at the bottom his face be flush with anger and his brow be wrinkle like one who be at his wit 's end what to do "halloa watson where have you drop from say he you do n't mean to say that you come after i in spite of all?"i explain everything to he how have find it impossible to remain behind how have follow he and how have witness all that have occur for an instant his eye blaze at i but my frankness disarm his anger and he break at last into rather rueful laugh "you would have think the middle of that prairie fairly safe place for man to be private say he but by thunder the whole countryside seem to have be out to see i do my wooing and mighty poor wooing at that where have you engage seat?""i be on that hill ""quite in the back row eh but her brother be well up to the front do you see he come out on us?""yes do ""did he ever strike you as be crazy this brother of hers?""i ca n't say that he ever do ""i dare say not always think he sane enough until today but you can take it from i that either he or ought to be in straitjacket what be the matter with i anyhow you 've live near i for some week watson tell i straight now be there anything that would prevent i from make good husband to woman that loved?""i should say not ""he ca n't object to my worldly position so it must be myself that he have this down on what have he against i never hurt man or woman in my life that know of and yet he would not so much as let i touch the tip of her finger ""did he say so?""that and deal more tell you watson 've only know she these few week but from the first just feel that she be make for i and she too she be happy when she be with i and that 'll swear there be light in woman 's eye that speak louder than word but he have never let we get together and it be only today for the first time that see chance of have few word with she alone she be glad to meet i but when she do it be not love that she would talk about and she would n't have let i talk about it either if she could have stop it she keep come back to it that this be place of danger and that she would never be happy until have leave it tell she that since have see she be in no hurry to leave it and that if she really want i to go the only way to work it be for she to arrange to go with i with that offer in as many word to marry she but before she could answer down come this brother of hers run at we with face on he like madman he be just white with rage and those light eye of his be blaze with fury what be do with the lady how dare offer her attention which be distasteful to she do think that because be baronet could do what like if he have not be her brother should have know well how to answer he as it be tell he that my feeling towards his sister be such as be not ashamed of and that hope that she might honour i by become my wife that seem to make the matter no well so then lose my temper too and answer he rather more hotly than should perhaps consider that she be stand by so it end by his go off with she as you see and here be as badly puzzle man as any in this county just tell i what it all mean watson and 'll owe you more than ever can hope to pay "i try one or two explanation but indeed be completely puzzle myself our friend 's title his fortune his age his character and his appearance be all in his favour and know nothing against he unless it be this dark fate which run in his family that his advance should be reject so brusquely without any reference to the lady 's own wish and that the lady should accept the situation without protest be very amazing however our conjecture be set at rest by visit from stapleton himself that very afternoon he have come to offer apology for his rudeness of the morning and after long private interview with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation be that the breach be quite heal and that we be to dine at merripit house next friday as sign of it "i do n't say now that he be n't crazy man say sir henry ca n't forget the look in his eye when he run at i this morning but must allow that no man could make more handsome apology than he have do ""did he give any explanation of his conduct?""his sister be everything in his life he say that be natural enough and be glad that he should understand her value they have always be together and accord to his account he have be very lonely man with only she as companion so that the thought of lose she be really terrible to he he have not understand he say that be becoming attach to she but when he see with his own eye that it be really so and that she might be take away from he it give he such shock that for time he be not responsible for what he say or do he be very sorry for all that have pass and he recognize how foolish and how selfish it be that he should imagine that he could hold beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life if she have to leave he he have rather it be to neighbour like myself than to anyone else but in any case it be blow to he and it would take he some time before he could prepare himself to meet it he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if would promise for three month to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivate the lady 's friendship during that time without claim her love this promise and so the matter rest "so there be one of our small mystery clear up it be something to have touch bottom anywhere in this bog in which we be flounder we know now why stapleton look with disfavour upon his sister 's suitor even when that
