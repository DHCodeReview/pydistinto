have be but we have leave he behind we and be certain that he could not have follow we stranger then be still dog we just as stranger dog we in london we have never shake he off if could lay my hand upon that man then at last we might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulty to this one purpose must now devote all my energy my first impulse be to tell sir henry all my plan my second and wise one be to play my own game and speak as little as possible to anyone he be silent and distrait his nerve have be strangely shake by that sound upon the moor will say nothing to add to his anxiety but will take my own step to attain my own end we have small scene this morning after breakfast barrymore ask leave to speak with sir henry and they be closet in his study some little time sit in the billiard room more than once hear the sound of voice raise and have pretty good idea what the point be which be under discussion after time the baronet open his door and call for i barrymore consider that he have grievance he say he think that it be unfair on our part to hunt his brother in law down when he of his own free will have tell we the secret "the butler be stand very pale but very collect before we "i may have speak too warmly sir say he and if have be sure that beg your pardon at the same time be very much surprised when hear you two gentleman come back this morning and learn that you have be chase selden the poor fellow have enough to fight against without my put more upon his track ""if you have tell we of your own free will it would have be different thing say the baronet you only tell we or rather your wife only tell we when it be force from you and you could not help yourself ""i do n't think you would have take advantage of it sir henry indeed didn't ""the man be public danger there be lonely house scatter over the moor and he be fellow who would stick at nothing you only want to get glimpse of his face to see that look at mr. stapleton 's house for example with no one but himself to defend it there be no safety for anyone until he be under lock and key ""he'll break into no house sir give you my solemn word upon that but he will never trouble anyone in this country again assure you sir henry that in very few day the necessary arrangement will have be make and he will be on his way to south america for god 's sake sir beg of you not to let the police know that he be still on the moor they have give up the chase there and he can lie quiet until the ship be ready for he you ca n't tell on he without get my wife and i into trouble beg you sir to say nothing to the police ""what do you say watson?"i shrug my shoulder if he be safely out of the country it would relieve the tax payer of burden ""but how about the chance of his hold someone up before he goes?""he would not do anything so mad sir we have provide he with all that he can want to commit crime would be to show where he be hide ""that be true say sir henry well barrymore god bless you sir and thank you from my heart it would have kill my poor wife have he be take again ""i guess we be aid and abet felony watson but after what we have hear do n't feel as if could give the man up so there be an end of it all right barrymore you can go "with few broken word of gratitude the man turn but he hesitate and then come back "you've be so kind to we sir that should like to do the good can for you in return know something sir henry and perhaps should have say it before but it be long after the inquest that find it out 've never breathe word about it yet to mortal man it be about poor sir charles 's death "the baronet and be both upon our foot do you know how he died?""no sir do n't know that ""what then?""i know why he be at the gate at that hour it be to meet woman ""to meet woman he?""yes sir ""and the woman 's name?""i ca n't give you the name sir but can give you the initial her initial be l. l.""how do you know this barrymore?""well sir henry your uncle have letter that morning he have usually great many letter for he be public man and well know for his kind heart so that everyone who be in trouble be glad to turn to he but that morning as it chance there be only this one letter so take the more notice of it it be from coombe tracey and it be address in woman 's hand ""well?""well sir think no more of the matter and never would have do have it not be for my wife only few week ago she be clean out sir charles 's study it have never be touch since his death and she find the ashe of burn letter in the back of the grate the great part of it be char to piece but one little slip the end of page hang together and the writing could still be read though it be gray on black ground it seem to we to be postscript at the end of the letter and it say please please as you be gentleman burn this letter and be at the gate by ten clock beneath it be sign the initial l. l.""have you get that slip?""no sir it crumble all to bit after we move it ""had sir charles receive any other letter in the same writing?""well sir take no particular notice of his letter should not have notice this one only it happen to come alone ""and you have no idea who l. l. is?""no sir no more than you have but expect if we could lay our hand upon that lady we should know more about sir charles 's death ""i can not understand barrymore how you come to conceal this important information ""well sir it be immediately after that our own trouble come to we and then again sir we be both of we very fond of sir charles as we well might be consider all that he have do for we to rake this up could n't help our poor master and it be well to go carefully when there be lady in the case even the good of we you think it might injure his reputation?""well sir think no good could come of it but now you have be kind to we and feel as if it would be treat you unfairly not to tell you all that know about the matter ""very good barrymore you can go when the butler have leave we sir henry turn to i well watson what do you think of this new light?""it seem to leave the darkness rather blacker than before ""so think but if we can only trace l. l. it should clear up the whole business we have gain that much we know that there be someone who have the fact if we can only find she what do you think we should do?""let holme know all about it at once it will give he the clue for which he have be seek be much mistaken if it do not bring he down "i go at once to my room and draw up my report of the morning 's conversation for holmes it be evident to i that he have be very busy of late for the note which have from baker street be few and short with no comment upon the information which have supply and hardly any reference to my mission no doubt his blackmailing case be absorb all his faculty and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest wish that he be here october 17th all day today the rain pour down rustle on the ivy and dripping from the eave think of the convict out upon the bleak cold shelterless moor poor devil whatever his crime he have suffer something to atone for they and then think of that other one the face in the cab the figure against the moon be he also out in that deluge the unseen watcher the man of darkness in the evening put on my waterproof and walk far upon the sodden moor full of dark imagining the rain beat upon my face and the wind whistle about my ear god help those who wander into the great mire now for even the firm upland be become morass find the black tor upon which have see the solitary watcher and from its craggy summit look out myself across the melancholy down rain squall drift across their russet face and the heavy slate colour cloud hang low over the landscape trail in gray wreath down the side of the fantastic hill in the distant hollow on the left half hide by the mist the two thin tower of baskerville hall rise above the tree they be the only sign of human life which could see save only those prehistoric hut which lie thickly upon the slope of the hill nowhere be there any trace of that lonely man whom have see on the same spot two night before as walk back be overtake by dr. mortimer drive in his dog cart over rough moorland track which lead from the outlying farmhouse of foulmire he have be very attentive to we and hardly day have pass that he have not call at the hall to see how we be get on he insist upon my climbing into his dog cart and he give i lift homeward find he much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel it have wander on to the moor and have never come back give he such consolation as might but think of the pony on the grimpen mire and do not fancy that he will see his little dog again "by the way mortimer say as we jolt along the rough road suppose there be few people live within drive distance of this whom you do not know?""hardly any think ""can you then tell i the name of any woman whose initial be l. l.?"he think for few minute "no say he there be few gipsy and labour folk for whom ca n't answer but among the farmer or gentry there be no one whose initial be those wait bit though he add after pause there be laura lyons her initial be l. l. but she live in coombe tracey ""who be she ask "she be frankland 's daughter ""what old frankland the crank?""exactly she marry an artist name lyons who came sketch on the moor he prove to be blackguard and desert she the fault from what hear may not have be entirely on one side her father refuse to have anything to do with she because she have marry without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reason as well so between the old sinner and the young one the girl have have pretty bad time ""how do she live?""i fancy old frankland allow she pittance but it can not be more for his own affair be considerably involve whatever she may have deserve one could not allow she to go hopelessly to the bad her story get about and several of the people here do something to enable she to earn an honest living stapleton do for one and sir charles for another give trifle myself it be to set she up in typewriting business "he want to know the object of my inquiry but manage to satisfy his curiosity without tell he too much for there be no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence tomorrow morning shall find my way to coombe tracey and if can see this mrs. laura lyons of equivocal reputation long step will have be make towards clear one incident in this chain of mystery be certainly develop the wisdom of the serpent for when mortimer press his question to an inconvenient extent ask he casually to what type frankland 's skull belong and so hear nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive have not live for year with sherlock holmes for nothing have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day this be my conversation with barrymore just now which give i one more strong card which can play in due time mortimer have stay to dinner and he and the baronet play ecarte afterwards the butler bring i my coffee into the library and take the chance to ask he few question "well say have this precious relation of yours depart or be he still lurk out yonder?""i do n't know sir hope to heaven that he have go for he have bring nothing but trouble here 've not hear of he since leave out food for he last and that be three day ago ""did you see he then?""no sir but the food be go when next go that way ""then he be certainly there?""so you would think sir unless it be the other man who take it "i sit with my coffee cup halfway to my lip and stare at barrymore "you know that there be another man then?""yes sir there be another man upon the moor ""have you see him?""no sir ""how do you know of he then?""selden tell i of he sir week ago or more he be in hiding too but he be not convict as far as can make out do n't like it dr. watson tell you straight sir that do n't like it he speak with sudden passion of earnestness "now listen to i barrymore have no interest in this matter but that of your master have come here with no object except to help he tell i frankly what it be that you do n't like "barrymore hesitate for moment as if he regret his outburst or find it difficult to express his own feeling in word "it be all these going on sir he cry at last wave his hand towards the rain lash window which face the moor there be foul play somewhere and there be black villainy brewing to that 'll swear very glad should be sir to see sir henry on his way back to london again!""but what be it that alarm you?""look at sir charles 's death that be bad enough for all that the coroner say look at the noise on the moor at night there be not man would cross it after sundown if he be pay for it look at this stranger hide out yonder and watch and wait what be he wait for what do it mean it mean no good to anyone of the name of baskerville and very glad shall be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henry 's new servant be ready to take over the hall ""but about this stranger say i. can you tell i anything about he what do selden say do he find out where he hide or what he be doing?""he see he once or twice but he be deep one and give nothing away at first he think that he be the police but soon he find that he have some lay of his own kind of gentleman he be as far as he could see but what he be do he could not make out ""and where do he say that he lived?""among the old house on the hillside the stone hut where the old folk use to live ""but how about his food?""selden find out that he have get lad who work for he and bring all he need dare say he go to coombe tracey for what he want ""very good barrymore we may talk far of this some other time when the butler have go walk over to the black window and look through blurred pane at the drive cloud and at the tossing outline of the wind sweep tree it be wild night indoor and what must it be in stone hut upon the moor what passion of hatred can it be which lead man to lurk in such place at such time and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which call for such trial there in that hut upon the moor seem to lie the very centre of that problem which have vex i so sorely swear that another day shall not have pass before have do all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery the extract from my private diary which form the last chapter have bring my narrative up to the eighteenth of october time when these strange event begin to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion the incident of the next few day be indelibly graven upon my recollection and can tell they without reference to the note make at the time start they from the day which succeed that upon which have establish two fact of great importance the one that mrs. laura lyons of coombe tracey have write to sir charles baskerville and make an appointment with he at the very place and hour that he meet his death the other that the lurk man upon the moor be to be find among the stone hut upon the hillside with these two fact in my possession feel that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if could not throw some further light upon these dark place have no opportunity to tell the baronet what have learn about mrs. lyons upon the evening before for dr. mortimer remain with he at card until it be very late at breakfast however inform he about my discovery and ask he whether he would care to accompany i to coombe tracey at first he be very eager to come but on second thought it seem to both of we that if go alone the result might be well the more formal we make the visit the less information we might obtain leave sir henry behind therefore not without some pricking of conscience and drive off upon my new quest when reach coombe tracey tell perkins to put up the horse and make inquiry for the lady whom have come to interrogate have no difficulty in find her room which be central and well appoint maid show i in without ceremony and as enter the sitting room lady who be sit before remington typewriter spring up with pleasant smile of welcome her face fall however when she see that be stranger and she sit down again and ask i the object of my visit the first impression leave by mrs. lyons be one of extreme beauty her eye and hair be of the same rich hazel colour and her cheek though considerably freckle be flush with the exquisite bloom of the brunette the dainty pink which lurk at the heart of the sulphur rise admiration be repeat the first impression but the second be criticism there be something subtly wrong with the face some coarseness of expression some hardness perhaps of eye some looseness of lip which mar its perfect beauty but these of course be afterthought at the moment be simply conscious that be in the presence of very handsome woman and that she be ask i the reason for my visit have not quite understand until that instant how delicate my mission be "i have the pleasure say of know your father "it be clumsy introduction and the lady make i feel it there be nothing in common between my father and i she say owe he nothing and his friend be not mine if it be not for the late sir charles baskerville and some other kind heart might have starve for all that my father care ""it be about the late sir charles baskerville that have come here to see you "the freckle start out on the lady 's face "what can tell you about he she ask and her finger play nervously over the stop of her typewriter "you know he do you not?""i have already say that owe great deal to his kindness if be able to support myself it be largely due to the interest which he take in my unhappy situation ""did you correspond with him?"the lady look quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eye "what be the object of these question she ask sharply "the object be to avoid public scandal it be well that should ask they here than that the matter should pass outside our control "she be silent and her face be still very pale at last she look up with something reckless and defiant in her manner "well 'll answer she say what be your questions?""did you correspond with sir charles?""i certainly write to he once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity ""have you the date of those letters?""no ""have you ever meet him?""yes once or twice when he come into coombe tracey he be very retire man and he prefer to do good by stealth ""but if you see he so seldom and write so seldom how do he know enough about your affair to be able to help you as you say that he have done?"she meet my difficulty with the utmost readiness "there be several gentleman who know my sad history and unite to help i one be mr. stapleton neighbour and intimate friend of sir charles 's he be exceedingly kind and it be through he that sir charles learn about my affair "i know already that sir charles baskerville have make stapleton his almoner upon several occasion so the lady 's statement bear the impress of truth upon it "did you ever write to sir charles ask he to meet you continue mrs. lyons flush with anger again really sir this be very extraordinary question ""i be sorry madam but must repeat it ""then answer certainly not ""not on the very day of sir charles 's death?"the flush have fade in an instant and deathly face be before i her dry lip could not speak the no which see rather than hear "surely your memory deceive you say i. could even quote passage of your letter it run please please as you be gentleman burn this letter and be at the gate by ten o'clock '"i think that she have faint but she recover herself by supreme effort "is there no such thing as gentleman she gasp "you do sir charles an injustice he do burn the letter but sometimes letter may be legible even when burn you acknowledge now that you write it?""yes do write it she cry pour out her soul in torrent of word do write it why should deny it have no reason to be ashamed of it wish he to help i believe that if have an interview could gain his help so ask he to meet i ""but why at such an hour?""because have only just learn that he be go to london next day and might be away for month there be reason why could not get there early ""but why rendezvous in the garden instead of visit to the house?""do you think woman could go alone at that hour to bachelor 's house?""well what happen when you do get there?""i never go ""mrs lyons!""no swear it to you on all hold sacred never go something intervene to prevent my going ""what be that?""that be private matter can not tell it ""you acknowledge then that you make an appointment with sir charles at the very hour and place at which he meet his death but you deny that you keep the appointment ""that be the truth "again and again cross question she but could never get past that point "mrs lyon say as rise from this long and inconclusive interview you be take very great responsibility and put yourself in very false position by not make an absolutely clean breast of all that you know if have to call in the aid of
