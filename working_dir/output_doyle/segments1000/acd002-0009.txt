the police you will find how seriously you be compromise if your position be innocent why do you in the first instance deny having write to sir charles upon that date?""because fear that some false conclusion might be draw from it and that might find myself involve in scandal ""and why be you so press that sir charles should destroy your letter?""if you have read the letter you will know ""i do not say that have read all the letter ""you quote some of it ""i quote the postscript the letter have as say be burn and it be not all legible ask you once again why it be that you be so press that sir charles should destroy this letter which he receive on the day of his death ""the matter be very private one ""the more reason why you should avoid public investigation ""i will tell you then if you have hear anything of my unhappy history you will know that make rash marriage and have reason to regret it ""i have hear so much ""my life have be one incessant persecution from husband whom abhor the law be upon his side and every day be face by the possibility that he may force i to live with he at the time that write this letter to sir charles have learn that there be prospect of my regain my freedom if certain expense could be meet it mean everything to i peace of mind happiness self respect everything know sir charles 's generosity and think that if he hear the story from my own lip he would help i ""then how be it that you do not go?""because receive help in the interval from another source ""why then do you not write to sir charles and explain this?""so should have do have not see his death in the paper next morning "the woman 's story hang coherently together and all my question be unable to shake it could only check it by find if she have indeed institute divorce proceeding against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy it be unlikely that she would dare to say that she have not be to baskerville hall if she really have be for trap would be necessary to take she there and could not have return to coombe tracey until the early hour of the morning such an excursion could not be keep secret the probability be therefore that she be tell the truth or at least part of the truth come away baffle and dishearten once again have reach that dead wall which seem to be build across every path by which try to get at the object of my mission and yet the more think of the lady 's face and of her manner the more feel that something be be hold back from i why should she turn so pale why should she fight against every admission until it be force from she why should she have be so reticent at the time of the tragedy surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have i believe for the moment could proceed no far in that direction but must turn back to that other clue which be to be seek for among the stone hut upon the moor and that be most vague direction realize it as drive back and note how hill after hill show trace of the ancient people barrymore 's only indication have be that the stranger live in one of these abandon hut and many hundred of they be scatter throughout the length and breadth of the moor but have my own experience for guide since it have show i the man himself stand upon the summit of the black tor that then should be the centre of my search from there should explore every hut upon the moor until light upon the right one if this man be inside it should find out from his own lip at the point of my revolver if necessary who he be and why he have dog we so long he might slip away from we in the crowd of regent street but it would puzzle he to do so upon the lonely moor on the other hand if should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it must remain there however long the vigil until he return holme have miss he in london it would indeed be triumph for i if could run he to earth where my master have fail luck have be against we again and again in this inquiry but now at last it come to my aid and the messenger of good fortune be none other than mr. frankland who be stand gray whisker and red face outside the gate of his garden which open on to the highroad along which travel "good day dr. watson cry he with unwonted good humour you must really give your horse rest and come in to have glass of wine and to congratulate i "my feeling towards he be very far from be friendly after what have hear of his treatment of his daughter but be anxious to send perkins and the wagonette home and the opportunity be good one alight and send message to sir henry that should walk over in time for dinner then follow frankland into his dining room "it be great day for i sir one of the red letter day of my life he cry with many chuckle have bring off double event mean to teach they in these part that law be law and that there be man here who do not fear to invoke it have establish right of way through the centre of old middleton 's park slap across it sir within hundred yard of his own front door what do you think of that we 'll teach these magnate that they can not ride roughshod over the right of the commoner confound they and 've close the wood where the fernworthy folk use to picnic these infernal people seem to think that there be no right of property and that they can swarm where they like with their paper and their bottle both case decide dr. watson and both in my favour have n't have such day since have sir john morland for trespass because he shoot in his own warren ""how on earth do you do that?""look it up in the book sir it will repay reading frankland v. morland court of queen 's bench it cost i 200 pound but get my verdict ""did it do you any good?""none sir none be proud to say that have no interest in the matter act entirely from sense of public duty have no doubt for example that the fernworthy people will burn i in effigy tonight tell the police last time they do it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibition the county constabulary be in scandalous state sir and it have not afford i the protection to which be entitle the case of frankland v. regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public tell they that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of i and already my word have come true ""how so ask the old man put on very know expression because could tell they what they be die to know but nothing would induce i to help the rascal in any way "i have be cast round for some excuse by which could get away from his gossip but now begin to wish to hear more of it have see enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the sure way to stop his confidence "some poach case no doubt say with an indifferent manner "ha ha my boy very much more important matter than that what about the convict on the moor?"i stare you do n't mean that you know where he be say i."i may not know exactly where he be but be quite sure that could help the police to lay their hand on he have it never strike you that the way to catch that man be to find out where he get his food and so trace it to him?"he certainly seem to be get uncomfortably near the truth no doubt say but how do you know that he be anywhere upon the moor?""i know it because have see with my own eye the messenger who take he his food "my heart sink for barrymore it be serious thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody but his next remark take weight from my mind "you'll be surprised to hear that his food be take to he by child see he every day through my telescope upon the roof he pass along the same path at the same hour and to whom should he be go except to the convict?"here be luck indeed and yet suppress all appearance of interest child barrymore have say that our unknown be supply by boy it be on his track and not upon the convict 's that frankland have stumble if could get his knowledge it might save i long and weary hunt but incredulity and indifference be evidently my strong card "i should say that it be much more likely that it be the son of one of the moorland shepherd take out his father 's dinner "the least appearance of opposition strike fire out of the old autocrat his eye look malignantly at i and his gray whisker bristle like those of an angry cat "indeed sir say he point out over the wide stretch moor do you see that black tor over yonder well do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it it be the stony part of the whole moor be that place where shepherd would be likely to take his station your suggestion sir be most absurd one "i meekly answer that have speak without know all the fact my submission please he and lead he to further confidence "you may be sure sir that have very good ground before come to an opinion have see the boy again and again with his bundle every day and sometimes twice day have be able but wait moment dr. watson do my eye deceive i or be there at the present moment something move upon that hillside?"it be several mile off but could distinctly see small dark dot against the dull green and gray "come sir come cry frankland rush upstairs you will see with your own eye and judge for yourself "the telescope formidable instrument mount upon tripod stand upon the flat lead of the house frankland clap his eye to it and give cry of satisfaction "quick dr. watson quick before he pass over the hill!"there he be sure enough small urchin with little bundle upon his shoulder toil slowly up the hill when he reach the crest see the ragged uncouth figure outline for an instant against the cold blue sky he look round he with furtive and stealthy air as one who dread pursuit then he vanish over the hill "well be right?""certainly there be boy who seem to have some secret errand ""and what the errand be even county constable could guess but not one word shall they have from i and bind you to secrecy also dr. watson not word you understand!""just as you wish ""they have treat i shamefully shamefully when the fact come out in frankland v. regina venture to think that thrill of indignation will run through the country nothing would induce i to help the police in any way for all they care it might have be i instead of my effigy which these rascal burn at the stake surely you be not go you will help i to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion!"but resist all his solicitation and succeed in dissuade he from his announced intention of walk home with i keep the road as long as his eye be on i and then strike off across the moor and make for the stony hill over which the boy have disappear everything be work in my favour and swear that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that should miss the chance which fortune have throw in my way the sun be already sink when reach the summit of the hill and the long slope beneath i be all golden green on one side and gray shadow on the other haze lie low upon the farth sky line out of which jut the fantastic shape of belliver and vixen tor over the wide expanse there be no sound and no movement one great gray bird gull or curlew soar aloft in the blue heaven he and seem to be the only live thing between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it the barren scene the sense of loneliness and the mystery and urgency of my task all strike chill into my heart the boy be nowhere to be see but down beneath i in cleft of the hill there be circle of the old stone hut and in the middle of they there be one which retain sufficient roof to act as screen against the weather my heart leap within i as see it this must be the burrow where the stranger lurk at last my foot be on the threshold of his hiding place his secret be within my grasp as approach the hut walk as warily as stapleton would do when with poise net he draw near the settled butterfly satisfy myself that the place have indeed be use as habitation vague pathway among the boulder lead to the dilapidated opening which serve as door all be silent within the unknown might be lurk there or he might be prowl on the moor my nerve tingle with the sense of adventure throw aside my cigarette close my hand upon the butt of my revolver and walk swiftly up to the door look in the place be empty but there be ample sign that have not come upon false scent this be certainly where the man live some blanket roll in waterproof lie upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man have once slumber the ashe of fire be heap in rude grate beside it lie some cooking utensil and bucket half full of water litter of empty tin show that the place have be occupy for some time and see as my eye become accustomed to the checker light pannikin and half full bottle of spirit stand in the corner in the middle of the hut flat stone serve the purpose of table and upon this stand small cloth bundle the same no doubt which have see through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy it contain loaf of bread tin tongue and two tin of preserve peach as set it down again after having examine it my heart leap to see that beneath it there lie sheet of paper with write upon it raise it and this be what read roughly scrawl in pencil dr. watson have go to coombe tracey "for minute stand there with the paper in my hand think out the meaning of this curt message it be then and not sir henry who be be dog by this secret man he have not follow i himself but he have set an agent the boy perhaps upon my track and this be his report possibly have take no step since have be upon the moor which have not be observe and report always there be this feeling of an unseen force fine net draw round we with infinite skill and delicacy hold we so lightly that it be only at some supreme moment that one realize that one be indeed entangle in its mesh if there be one report there might be other so look round the hut in search of they there be no trace however of anything of the kind nor could discover any sign which might indicate the character or intention of the man who live in this singular place save that he must be of spartan habit and care little for the comfort of life when think of the heavy rain and look at the gape roof understand how strong and immutable must be the purpose which have keep he in that inhospitable abode be he our malignant enemy or be he by chance our guardian angel swear that would not leave the hut until know outside the sun be sink low and the west be blaze with scarlet and gold its reflection be shoot back in ruddy patch by the distant pool which lie amid the great grimpen mire there be the two tower of baskerville hall and there distant blur of smoke which mark the village of grimpen between the two behind the hill be the house of the stapletons all be sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light and yet as look at they my soul share none of the peace of nature but quiver at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant be bring near with tingling nerve but fixed purpose sit in the dark recess of the hut and wait with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant and then at last hear he far away come the sharp clink of boot strike upon stone then another and yet another come near and nearer shrink back into the dark corner and cock the pistol in my pocket determine not to discover myself until have an opportunity of see something of the stranger there be long pause which show that he have stop then once more the footstep approach and shadow fall across the opening of the hut "it be lovely evening my dear watson say well know voice really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in "for moment or two sit breathless hardly able to believe my ear then my sense and my voice come back to i while crush weight of responsibility seem in an instant to be lift from my soul that cold incisive ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world "holme cry holmes!""come out say he and please be careful with the revolver "i stoop under the rude lintel and there he sit upon stone outside his gray eye dance with amusement as they fall upon my astonish feature he be thin and worn but clear and alert his keen face bronze by the sun and roughen by the wind in his tweed suit and cloth cap he look like any other tourist upon the moor and he have contrive with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which be one of his characteristic that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he be in baker street "i never be more glad to see anyone in my life say as wring he by the hand "or more astonished eh?""well must confess to it ""the surprise be not all on one side assure you have no idea that you have find my occasional retreat still less that you be inside it until be within twenty pace of the door ""my footprint presume?""no watson fear that could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprint of the world if you seriously desire to deceive i you must change your tobacconist for when see the stub of cigarette mark bradley oxford street know that my friend watson be in the neighbourhood you will see it there beside the path you throw it down no doubt at that supreme moment when you charge into the empty hut ""exactly ""i think as much and know your admirable tenacity be convince that you be sit in ambush weapon within reach wait for the tenant to return so you actually think that be the criminal?""i do not know who you be but be determined to find out ""excellent watson and how do you localize i you see i perhaps on the night of the convict hunt when be so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?""yes see you then ""and have no doubt search all the hut until you come to this one?""no your boy have be observe and that give i guide where to look ""the old gentleman with the telescope no doubt could not make it out when first see the light flash upon the lens he rise and peep into the hut ha see that cartwright have bring up some supply what be this paper so you have be to coombe tracey have you?""yes ""to see mrs. laura lyons?""exactly ""well do our research have evidently be run on parallel line and when we unite our result expect we shall have fairly full knowledge of the case ""well be glad from my heart that you be here for indeed the responsibility and the mystery be both become too much for my nerve but how in the name of wonder do you come here and what have you be do think that you be in baker street work out that case of blackmailing ""that be what wish you to think ""then you use i and yet do not trust i cry with some bitterness think that have deserve well at your hand holmes ""my dear fellow you have be invaluable to i in this as in many other case and beg that you will forgive i if have seem to play trick upon you in truth it be partly for your own sake that do it and it be my appreciation of the danger which you run which lead i to come down and examine the matter for myself have be with sir henry and you it be confident that my point of view would have be the same as yours and my presence would have warn our very formidable opponent to be on their guard as it be have be able to get about as could not possibly have do have be live in the hall and remain an unknown factor in the business ready to throw in all my weight at critical moment ""but why keep i in the dark?""for you to know could not have help we and might possibly have lead to my discovery you would have wish to tell i something or in your kindness you would have bring i out some comfort or other and so an unnecessary risk would be run bring cartwright down with i you remember the little chap at the express office and he have see after my simple want loaf of bread and clean collar what do man want more he have give i an extra pair of eye upon very active pair of foot and both have be invaluable ""then my report have all be waste my voice tremble as recall the pain and the pride with which have compose they holme take bundle of paper from his pocket "here be your report my dear fellow and very well thumbed assure you make excellent arrangement and they be only delay one day upon their way must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have show over an extraordinarily difficult case "i be still rather raw over the deception which have be practise upon i but the warmth of holmes 's praise drive my anger from my mind feel also in my heart that he be right in what he say and that it be really good for our purpose that should not have know that he be upon the moor "that be well say he see the shadow rise from my face and now tell i the result of your visit to mrs. laura lyons it be not difficult for i to guess that it be to see she that you have go for be already aware that she be the one person in coombe tracey who might be of service to we in the matter in fact if you have not go today it be exceedingly probable that should have go tomorrow "the sun have set and dusk be settle over the moor the air have turn chill and we withdraw into the hut for warmth there sit together in the twilight tell holmes of my conversation with the lady so interested be he that have to repeat some of it twice before he be satisfied "this be most important say he when have conclude it fill up gap which have be unable to bridge in this most complex affair you be aware perhaps that close intimacy exist between this lady and the man stapleton?""i do not know of close intimacy ""there can be no doubt about the matter they meet they write there be complete
