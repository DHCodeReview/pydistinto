understanding between they now this put very powerful weapon into our hand if could only use it to detach his wife his wife?""i be give you some information now in return for all that you have give i the lady who have pass here as miss stapleton be in reality his wife ""good heaven holmes be you sure of what you say how could he have permit sir henry to fall in love with her?""sir henry 's fall in love could do no harm to anyone except sir henry he take particular care that sir henry do not make love to she as you have yourself observe repeat that the lady be his wife and not his sister ""but why this elaborate deception?""because he foresee that she would be very much more useful to he in the character of free woman "all my unspoken instinct my vague suspicion suddenly take shape and centre upon the naturalist in that impassive colourless man with his straw hat and his butterfly net seem to see something terrible creature of infinite patience and craft with smile face and murderous heart "it be he then who be our enemy it be he who dog we in london?""so read the riddle ""and the warning it must have come from her!""exactly "the shape of some monstrous villainy half see half guess loom through the darkness which have girt i so long "but be you sure of this holmes how do you know that the woman be his wife?""because he so far forget himself as to tell you true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first meet you and dare say he have many time regret it since he be once schoolmaster in the north of england now there be no one more easy to trace than schoolmaster there be scholastic agency by which one may identify any man who have be in the profession little investigation show i that school have come to grief under atrocious circumstance and that the man who have own it the name be different have disappear with his wife the description agree when learn that the miss man be devoted to entomology the identification be complete "the darkness be rise but much be still hide by the shadow "if this woman be in truth his wife where do mrs. laura lyons come in ask "that be one of the point upon which your own research have shed light your interview with the lady have clear the situation very much do not know about project divorce between herself and her husband in that case regard stapleton as an unmarried man she count no doubt upon become his wife ""and when she be undeceived?""why then we may find the lady of service it must be our first duty to see she both of we tomorrow do n't you think watson that you be away from your charge rather long your place should be at baskerville hall "the last red streak have fade away in the west and night have settle upon the moor few faint star be gleam in violet sky "one last question holmes say as rise surely there be no need of secrecy between you and i what be the meaning of it all what be he after?"holmes 's voice sink as he answered:"it be murder watson refine cold blooded deliberate murder do not ask i for particular my net be close upon he even as his be upon sir henry and with your help he be already almost at my mercy there be but one danger which can threaten we it be that he should strike before we be ready to do so another day two at the most and have my case complete but until then guard your charge as closely as ever fond mother watch her ail child your mission today have justify itself and yet could almost wish that you have not leave his side hark!"a terrible scream prolong yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor that frightful cry turn the blood to ice in my vein "oh my god gasp what be it what do it mean?"holmes have spring to his foot and see his dark athletic outline at the door of the hut his shoulder stoop his head thrust forward his face peer into the darkness "hush he whisper hush!"the cry have be loud on account of its vehemence but it have peal out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain now it burst upon our ear near louder more urgent than before "where be it holme whisper and know from the thrill of his voice that he the man of iron be shake to the soul where be it watson?""there think point into the darkness "no there!"again the agonize cry sweep through the silent night louder and much near than ever and new sound mingle with it deep mutter rumble musical and yet menacing rise and fall like the low constant murmur of the sea "the hound cry holmes come watson come great heaven if we be too late!"he have start run swiftly over the moor and have follow at his heel but now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of we there come one last despairing yell and then dull heavy thud we halt and listen not another sound break the heavy silence of the windless night see holmes put his hand to his forehead like man distract he stamp his foot upon the ground "he have beat we watson we be too late ""no no surely not!""fool that be to hold my hand and you watson see what come of abandon your charge but by heaven if the bad have happen we 'll avenge him!"blindly we run through the gloom blunder against boulder force our way through gorse bush pant up hill and rush down slope head always in the direction whence those dreadful sound have come at every rise holmes look eagerly round he but the shadow be thick upon the moor and nothing move upon its dreary face "can you see anything?""nothing ""but hark what be that?"a low moan have fall upon our ear there it be again upon our left on that side ridge of rock end in sheer cliff which overlook stone strew slope on its jagged face be spread eagle some dark irregular object as we run towards it the vague outline harden into definite shape it be prostrate man face downward upon the ground the head double under he at horrible angle the shoulder round and the body hunch together as if in the act of throw somersault so grotesque be the attitude that could not for the instant realize that that moan have be the passing of his soul not whisper not rustle rise now from the dark figure over which we stoop holme lay his hand upon he and hold it up again with an exclamation of horror the gleam of the match which he strike shine upon his clotted finger and upon the ghastly pool which widen slowly from the crush skull of the victim and it shine upon something else which turn our heart sick and faint within we the body of sir henry baskerville!there be no chance of either of we forget that peculiar ruddy tweed suit the very one which he have wear on the first morning that we have see he in baker street we catch the one clear glimpse of it and then the match flicker and go out even as the hope have go out of our soul holme groan and his face glimmer white through the darkness "the brute the brute cry with clenched hand oh holmes shall never forgive myself for having leave he to his fate ""i be more to blame than you watson in order to have my case well rounded and complete have throw away the life of my client it be the great blow which have befall i in my career but how could know how could know that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings?""that we should have hear his scream my god those scream and yet have be unable to save he where be this brute of hound which drive he to his death it may be lurk among these rock at this instant and stapleton where be he he shall answer for this deed ""he shall will see to that uncle and nephew have be murder the one frighten to death by the very sight of beast which he think to be supernatural the other drive to his end in his wild flight to escape from it but now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast save from what we hear we can not even swear to the existence of the latter since sir henry have evidently die from the fall but by heaven cunning as he be the fellow shall be in my power before another day be past!"we stand with bitter heart on either side of the mangle body overwhelm by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which have bring all our long and weary labour to so piteous an end then as the moon rise we climb to the top of the rock over which our poor friend have fall and from the summit we gaze out over the shadowy moor half silver and half gloom far away mile off in the direction of grimpen single steady yellow light be shine it could only come from the lonely abode of the stapletons with bitter curse shake my fist at it as gaze "why should we not seize he at once?""our case be not complete the fellow be wary and cunning to the last degree it be not what we know but what we can prove if we make one false move the villain may escape we yet ""what can we do?""there will be plenty for we to do tomorrow tonight we can only perform the last office to our poor friend "together we make our way down the precipitous slope and approach the body black and clear against the silvered stone the agony of those contort limb strike i with spasm of pain and blur my eye with tear "we must send for help holmes we can not carry he all the way to the hall good heaven be you mad?"he have utter cry and bend over the body now he be dance and laugh and wring my hand could this be my stern self contain friend these be hidden fire indeed!"a beard beard the man have beard!""a beard?""it be not the baronet it be why it be my neighbour the convict!"with feverish haste we have turn the body over and that dripping beard be point up to the cold clear moon there could be no doubt about the beetle forehead the sink animal eye it be indeed the same face which have glare upon i in the light of the candle from over the rock the face of selden the criminal then in an instant it be all clear to i remember how the baronet have tell i that he have hand his old wardrobe to barrymore barrymore have pass it on in order to help selden in his escape boot shirt cap it be all sir henry 's the tragedy be still black enough but this man have at least deserve death by the law of his country tell holmes how the matter stand my heart bubble over with thankfulness and joy "then the clothe have be the poor devil 's death say he it be clear enough that the hound have be lay on from some article of sir henry 's the boot which be abstract in the hotel in all probability and so run this man down there be one very singular thing however how come selden in the darkness to know that the hound be on his trail?""he hear he ""to hear hound upon the moor would not work hard man like this convict into such paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by scream wildly for help by his cry he must have run long way after he know the animal be on his track how do he know?""a great mystery to i be why this hound presume that all our conjecture be correct presume nothing ""well then why this hound should be loose tonight suppose that it do not always run loose upon the moor stapleton would not let it go unless he have reason to think that sir henry would be there ""my difficulty be the more formidable of the two for think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours while mine may remain forever mystery the question now be what shall we do with this poor wretch 's body we can not leave it here to the fox and the raven ""i suggest that we put it in one of the hut until we can communicate with the police ""exactly have no doubt that you and could carry it so far halloa watson what be this it be the man himself by all that be wonderful and audacious not word to show your suspicion not word or my plan crumble to the ground "a figure be approach we over the moor and see the dull red glow of cigar the moon shine upon he and could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist he stop when he see we and then come on again "why dr. watson that be not you be it you be the last man that should have expect to see out on the moor at this time of night but dear i what be this somebody hurt not do n't tell i that it be our friend sir henry he hurry past i and stoop over the dead man hear sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fall from his finger "who who be this he stammer "it be selden the man who escape from princetown "stapleton turn ghastly face upon we but by supreme effort he have overcome his amazement and his disappointment he look sharply from holmes to i dear i what very shocking affair how do he die?""he appear to have break his neck by fall over these rock my friend and be stroll on the moor when we hear cry ""i hear cry also that be what bring i out be uneasy about sir henry ""why about sir henry in particular could not help ask "because have suggest that he should come over when he do not come be surprised and naturally become alarmed for his safety when hear cry upon the moor by the way his eye dart again from my face to holmes 's do you hear anything else besides cry?""no say holmes do you?""no ""what do you mean then?""oh you know the story that the peasant tell about phantom hound and so on it be say to be hear at night upon the moor be wonder if there be any evidence of such sound tonight ""we hear nothing of the kind say i."and what be your theory of this poor fellow 's death?""i have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have drive he off his head he have rush about the moor in crazy state and eventually fall over here and break his neck ""that seem the most reasonable theory say stapleton and he give sigh which take to indicate his relief what do you think about it mr. sherlock holmes?"my friend bow his compliment you be quick at identification say he "we have be expect you in these part since dr. watson come down you be in time to see tragedy ""yes indeed have no doubt that my friend 's explanation will cover the fact will take an unpleasant remembrance back to london with i tomorrow ""oh you return tomorrow?""that be my intention ""i hope your visit have cast some light upon those occurrence which have puzzle us?"holmes shrug his shoulder "one can not always have the success for which one hope an investigator need fact and not legend or rumour it have not be satisfactory case "my friend speak in his frank and most unconcerned manner stapleton still look hard at he then he turn to i "i would suggest carry this poor fellow to my house but it would give my sister such fright that do not feel justified in do it think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning "and so it be arrange resisting stapleton 's offer of hospitality holmes and set off to baskerville hall leave the naturalist to return alone look back we see the figure move slowly away over the broad moor and behind he that one black smudge on the silvered slope which show where the man be lie who have come so horribly to his end "we're at close grip at last say holmes as we walk together across the moor what nerve the fellow have how he pull himself together in the face of what must have be paralyze shock when he find that the wrong man have fall victim to his plot tell you in london watson and tell you now again that we have never have foeman more worthy of our steel ""i be sorry that he have see you ""and so be at first but there be no get out of it ""what effect do you think it will have upon his plan now that he know you be here?""it may cause he to be more cautious or it may drive he to desperate measure at once like most clever criminal he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he have completely deceive we ""why should we not arrest he at once?""my dear watson you be bear to be man of action your instinct be always to do something energetic but supposing for argument 's sake that we have he arrest tonight what on earth the well off should we be for that we could prove nothing against he there be the devilish cunning of it if he be act through human agent we could get some evidence but if we be to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help we in put rope round the neck of its master ""surely we have case ""not shadow of one only surmise and conjecture we should be laugh out of court if we come with such story and such evidence ""there be sir charles 's death ""found dead without mark upon he you and know that he die of sheer fright and we know also what frighten he but how be we to get twelve stolid juryman to know it what sign be there of hound where be the mark of its fang of course we know that hound do not bite dead body and that sir charles be dead before ever the brute overtake he but we have to prove all this and we be not in position to do it ""well then tonight?""we be not much well off tonight again there be no direct connection between the hound and the man 's death we never see the hound we hear it but we could not prove that it be run upon this man 's trail there be complete absence of motive no my dear fellow we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present and that it be worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one ""and how do you propose to do so?""i have great hope of what mrs. laura lyons may do for we when the position of affair be make clear to she and have my own plan as well sufficient for tomorrow be the evil thereof but hope before the day be past to have the upper hand at last "i could draw nothing far from he and he walk lose in thought as far as the baskerville gate "are you come up?""yes see no reason for further concealment but one last word watson say nothing of the hound to sir henry let he think that selden 's death be as stapleton would have we believe he will have well nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow when he be engaged if remember your report aright to dine with these people ""and so be i.""then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone that will be easily arrange and now if we be too late for dinner think that we be both ready for our supper "sir henry be more pleased than surprised to see sherlock holmes for he have for some day be expect that recent event would bring he down from london he do raise his eyebrow however when he find that my friend have neither any luggage nor any explanation for its absence between we we soon supply his want and then over belated supper we explain to the baronet as much of our experience as it seem desirable that he should know but first have the unpleasant duty of break the news to barrymore and his wife to he it may have be an unmitigated relief but she weep bitterly in her apron to all the world he be the man of violence half animal and half demon but to she he always remain the little wilful boy of her own girlhood the child who have clung to her hand evil indeed be the man who have not one woman to mourn he "i've be mope in the house all day since watson go off in the morning say the baronet guess should have some credit for have keep my promise if have n't swear not to go about alone might have have more lively evening for have message from stapleton ask i over there ""i have no doubt that you would have have more lively evening say holmes drily by the way do n't suppose you appreciate that we have be mourn over you as having break your neck?"sir henry open his eye how be that?""this poor wretch be dress in your clothe fear your servant who give they to he may get into trouble with the police ""that be unlikely there be no mark on any of they as far as know ""that be lucky for he in fact it be lucky for all of you since you be all on the wrong side of the law in this matter be not sure that as conscientious detective my first duty be not to arrest the whole household watson 's report be most incriminate document ""but how about the case ask the baronet have you make anything out of the tangle do n't know that watson and be much the wise since we come down ""i think that shall be in position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long it have be an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business there be several point upon which we still want light but it be come all the same ""we've have one experience as watson have no doubt tell you we hear the hound on the moor so can swear that it be not all empty superstition have something to do with dog when be out west and know one when hear one if you can muzzle that one and put he on chain 'll be ready to swear you be the great detective of all time ""i think will muzzle he and chain he all right if you will give i your help ""whatever you tell i to do will do ""very good and will ask you also to do it blindly without always ask the reason ""just as you like ""if you will do this think the chance be that our little problem will soon be solve have no doubt he stop suddenly and stare fixedly up over my head into the air the lamp beat upon his face and so intent be it and so still that it might have be that of clear cut classical statue personification of alertness and expectation "what be it we both cry could see as he look down that he be repress some internal emotion his feature be still compose but his eye shine with amused exultation "excuse the admiration of connoisseur say he as he wave his hand towards the line of portrait which cover the opposite wall watson wo n't allow that know anything of art but that be mere jealousy because our view upon the subject differ now these be really very fine series of portrait ""well be glad to hear you say so say sir henry glance with some surprise at my friend do n't pretend to know much about these thing and 'd be well judge of horse or steer than of picture do n't know that
