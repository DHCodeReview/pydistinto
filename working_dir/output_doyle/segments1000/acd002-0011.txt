you find time for such thing ""i know what be good when see it and see it now that be kneller 'll swear that lady in the blue silk over yonder and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be reynolds they be all family portrait presume?""every one ""do you know the names?""barrymore have be coach i in they and think can say my lesson fairly well ""who be the gentleman with the telescope?""that be rear admiral baskerville who serve under rodney in the west indies the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper be sir william baskerville who be chairman of committees of the house of commons under pitt ""and this cavalier opposite to i the one with the black velvet and the lace?""ah you have right to know about he that be the cause of all the mischief the wicked hugo who start the hound of the baskervilles we be not likely to forget he "i gaze with interest and some surprise upon the portrait "dear i say holmes he seem quiet meek mannered man enough but dare say that there be lurk devil in his eye have picture he as more robust and ruffianly person ""there be no doubt about the authenticity for the name and the date 1647 be on the back of the canvas "holme say little more but the picture of the old roysterer seem to have fascination for he and his eye be continually fix upon it during supper it be not until later when sir henry have go to his room that be able to follow the trend of his thought he lead i back into the banqueting hall his bedroom candle in his hand and he hold it up against the time stain portrait on the wall "do you see anything there?"i look at the broad plume hat the curl love lock the white lace collar and the straight severe face which be frame between they it be not brutal countenance but it be prim hard and stern with firm set thin lip mouth and coldly intolerant eye "is it like anyone you know?""there be something of sir henry about the jaw ""just suggestion perhaps but wait an instant he stand upon chair and hold up the light in his left hand he curve his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlet "good heaven cry in amazement the face of stapleton have spring out of the canvas "ha you see it now my eye have be train to examine face and not their trimming it be the first quality of criminal investigator that he should see through disguise ""but this be marvellous it might be his portrait ""yes it be an interesting instance of throwback which appear to be both physical and spiritual study of family portrait be enough to convert man to the doctrine of reincarnation the fellow be baskerville that be evident ""with design upon the succession ""exactly this chance of the picture have supply we with one of our most obvious miss link we have he watson we have he and dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be flutter in our net as helpless as one of his own butterfly pin cork and card and we add he to the baker street collection he burst into one of his rare fit of laughter as he turn away from the picture have not hear he laugh often and it have always bode ill to somebody be up betime in the morning but holmes be afoot early still for see he as dress come up the drive "yes we should have full day today he remark and he rub his hand with the joy of action the net be all in place and the drag be about to begin we 'll know before the day be out whether we have catch our big leanjawe pike or whether he have get through the mesh ""have you be on the moor already?""i have send report from grimpen to princetown as to the death of selden think can promise that none of you will be trouble in the matter and have also communicate with my faithful cartwright who would certainly have pine away at the door of my hut as dog do at his master 's grave if have not set his mind at rest about my safety ""what be the next move?""to see sir henry ah here he is!""good morning holmes say the baronet you look like general who be plan battle with his chief of the staff ""that be the exact situation watson be ask for order ""and so do i.""very good you be engaged as understand to dine with our friend the stapletons tonight ""i hope that you will come also they be very hospitable people and be sure that they would be very glad to see you ""i fear that watson and must go to london ""to london?""yes think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture "the baronet 's face perceptibly lengthen "i hope that you be go to see i through this business the hall and the moor be not very pleasant place when one be alone ""my dear fellow you must trust i implicitly and do exactly what tell you you can tell your friend that we should have be happy to have come with you but that urgent business require we to be in town we hope very soon to return to devonshire will you remember to give they that message?""if you insist upon it ""there be no alternative assure you "i see by the baronet 's clouded brow that he be deeply hurt by what he regard as our desertion "when do you desire to go he ask coldly "immediately after breakfast we will drive in to coombe tracey but watson will leave his thing as pledge that he will come back to you watson you will send note to stapleton to tell he that you regret that you can not come ""i have good mind to go to london with you say the baronet why should stay here alone?""because it be your post of duty because you give i your word that you would do as you be tell and tell you to stay ""all right then 'll stay ""one more direction wish you to drive to merripit house send back your trap however and let they know that you intend to walk home ""to walk across the moor?""yes ""but that be the very thing which you have so often caution i not to do ""this time you may do it with safety if have not every confidence in your nerve and courage would not suggest it but it be essential that you should do it ""then will do it ""and as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which lead from merripit house to the grimpen road and be your natural way home ""i will do just what you say ""very good should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible so as to reach london in the afternoon "i be much astounded by this programme though remember that holmes have say to stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate next day it have not cross my mind however that he would wish i to go with he nor could understand how we could both be absent at moment which he himself declare to be critical there be nothing for it however but implicit obedience so we bid good bye to our rueful friend and couple of hour afterwards we be at the station of coombe tracey and have dispatch the trap upon its return journey small boy be wait upon the platform "any order sir?""you will take this train to town cartwright the moment you arrive you will send wire to sir henry baskerville in my name to say that if he find the pocketbook which have drop he be to send it by registered post to baker street ""yes sir ""and ask at the station office if there be message for i "the boy return with telegram which holmes hand to i it run wire receive come down with unsigned warrant arrive five forty lestrade "that be in answer to mine of this morning he be the good of the professional think and we may need his assistance now watson think that we can not employ our time well than by call upon your acquaintance mrs. laura lyons "his plan of campaign be begin to be evident he would use the baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we be really go while we should actually return at the instant when we be likely to be need that telegram from london if mention by sir henry to the stapletons must remove the last suspicion from their mind already seem to see our net draw close around that leanjawe pike mrs. laura lyons be in her office and sherlock holmes open his interview with frankness and directness which considerably amaze she "i be investigate the circumstance which attend the death of the late sir charles baskerville say he my friend here dr. watson have inform i of what you have communicate and also of what you have withhold in connection with that matter ""what have withhold she ask defiantly "you have confess that you ask sir charles to be at the gate at ten o'clock we know that that be the place and hour of his death you have withhold what the connection be between these event ""there be no connection ""in that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one but think that we shall succeed in establish connection after all wish to be perfectly frank with you mrs. lyons we regard this case as one of murder and the evidence may implicate not only your friend mr. stapleton but his wife as well "the lady spring from her chair "his wife she cry "the fact be no long secret the person who have pass for his sister be really his wife "mrs lyon have resume her seat her hand be grasp the arm of her chair and see that the pink nail have turn white with the pressure of her grip "his wife she say again his wife he be not married man "sherlock holmes shrug his shoulder "prove it to i prove it to i and if you can do so the fierce flash of her eye say more than any word "i have come prepared to do so say holmes draw several paper from his pocket here be photograph of the couple take in york four year ago it be indorsed mr. and mrs. vandeleur but you will have no difficulty in recognize he and she also if you know she by sight here be three write description by trustworthy witness of mr. and mrs. vandeleur who at that time keep st. oliver 's private school read they and see if you can doubt the identity of these people "she glance at they and then look up at we with the set rigid face of desperate woman "mr holme she say this man have offer i marriage on condition that could get divorce from my husband he have lie to i the villain in every conceivable way not one word of truth have he ever tell i and why why imagine that all be for my own sake but now see that be never anything but tool in his hand why should preserve faith with he who never keep any with i why should try to shield he from the consequence of his own wicked act ask i what you like and there be nothing which shall hold back one thing swear to you and that be that when write the letter never dream of any harm to the old gentleman who have be my kind friend ""i entirely believe you madam say sherlock holmes the recital of these event must be very painful to you and perhaps it will make it easy if tell you what occur and you can check i if make any material mistake the sending of this letter be suggest to you by stapleton?""he dictate it ""i presume that the reason he give be that you would receive help from sir charles for the legal expense connect with your divorce?""exactly ""and then after you have send the letter he dissuade you from keep the appointment?""he tell i that it would hurt his self respect that any other man should find the money for such an object and that though he be poor man himself he would devote his last penny to remove the obstacle which divide we ""he appear to be very consistent character and then you hear nothing until you read the report of the death in the paper?""no ""and he make you swear to say nothing about your appointment with sir charles?""he do he say that the death be very mysterious one and that should certainly be suspect if the fact come out he frighten i into remain silent ""quite so but you have your suspicions?"she hesitate and look down "i know he she say but if he have keep faith with i should always have do so with he ""i think that on the whole you have have fortunate escape say sherlock holmes you have have he in your power and he know it and yet you be alive you have be walk for some month very near to the edge of precipice we must wish you good morning now mrs. lyons and it be probable that you will very shortly hear from we again ""our case become rounded off and difficulty after difficulty thin away in front of we say holmes as we stand wait for the arrival of the express from town shall soon be in the position of be able to put into single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crime of modern time student of criminology will remember the analogous incident in godno in little russia in the year 66 and of course there be the anderson murder in north carolina but this case possess some feature which be entirely its own even now we have no clear case against this very wily man but shall be very much surprised if it be not clear enough before we go to bed this night "the london express came roar into the station and small wiry bulldog of man have spring from first class carriage we all three shake hand and see at once from the reverential way in which lestrade gaze at my companion that he have learn good deal since the day when they have first work together could well remember the scorn which the theory of the reasoner use then to excite in the practical man "anything good he ask "the big thing for year say holmes we have two hour before we need think of start think we might employ it in get some dinner and then lestrade we will take the london fog out of your throat by give you breath of the pure night air of dartmoor never be there ah well do n't suppose you will forget your first visit "one of sherlock holmes 's defect if indeed one may call it defect be that he be exceedingly loath to communicate his full plan to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment partly it come no doubt from his own masterful nature which love to dominate and surprise those who be around he partly also from his professional caution which urge he never to take any chance the result however be very try for those who be act as his agent and assistant have often suffer under it but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness the great ordeal be in front of we at last we be about to make our final effort and yet holmes have say nothing and could only surmise what his course of action would be my nerve thrill with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our face and the dark void space on either side of the narrow road tell i that we be back upon the moor once again every stride of the horse and every turn of the wheel be take we near to our supreme adventure our conversation be hamper by the presence of the driver of the hire wagonette so that we be force to talk of trivial matter when our nerve be tense with emotion and anticipation it be relief to i after that unnatural restraint when we at last pass frankland 's house and know that we be draw near to the hall and to the scene of action we do not drive up to the door but get down near the gate of the avenue the wagonette be pay off and order to return to coombe tracey forthwith while we start to walk to merripit house "are you armed lestrade?"the little detective smile as long as have my trouser have hip pocket and as long as have my hip pocket have something in it ""good my friend and be also ready for emergency ""you're mighty close about this affair mr. holmes what be the game now?""a wait game ""my word it do not seem very cheerful place say the detective with shiver glance round he at the gloomy slope of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lie over the grimpen mire see the light of house ahead of we ""that be merripit house and the end of our journey must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above whisper "we move cautiously along the track as if we be bind for the house but holmes halt we when we be about two hundred yard from it "this will do say he these rock upon the right make an admirable screen ""we be to wait here?""yes we shall make our little ambush here get into this hollow lestrade you have be inside the house have you not watson can you tell the position of the room what be those latticed window at this end?""i think they be the kitchen window ""and the one beyond which shine so brightly?""that be certainly the dining room ""the blind be up you know the lie of the land good creep forward quietly and see what they be do but for heaven 's sake do n't let they know that they be watched!"i tiptoe down the path and stoop behind the low wall which surround the stunted orchard creep in its shadow reach point whence could look straight through the uncurtained window there be only two man in the room sir henry and stapleton they sit with their profile towards i on either side of the round table both of they be smoke cigar and coffee and wine be in front of they stapleton be talk with animation but the baronet look pale and distrait perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill omen moor be weigh heavily upon his mind as watch they stapleton rise and leave the room while sir henry fill his glass again and lean back in his chair puff at his cigar hear the creak of door and the crisp sound of boot upon gravel the step pass along the path on the other side of the wall under which crouch look over see the naturalist pause at the door of an out house in the corner of the orchard key turn in lock and as he pass in there be curious scuffling noise from within he be only minute or so inside and then hear the key turn once more and he pass i and reentere the house see he rejoin his guest and creep quietly back to where my companion be wait to tell they what have see "you say watson that the lady be not there holmes ask when have finish my report "no ""where can she be then since there be no light in any other room except the kitchen?""i can not think where she be "i have say that over the great grimpen mire there hang dense white fog it be drift slowly in our direction and bank itself up like wall on that side of we low but thick and well define the moon shine on it and it look like great shimmer ice field with the head of the distant tor as rock bear upon its surface holmes 's face be turn towards it and he mutter impatiently as he watch its sluggish drift "it be move towards we watson ""is that serious?""very serious indeed the one thing upon earth which could have disarrange my plan he ca n't be very long now it be already ten o'clock our success and even his life may depend upon his come out before the fog be over the path "the night be clear and fine above we the star shine cold and bright while half moon bathe the whole scene in soft uncertain light before we lie the dark bulk of the house its serrate roof and bristle chimney hard outline against the silver spangle sky broad bar of golden light from the low window stretch across the orchard and the moor one of they be suddenly shut off the servant have leave the kitchen there only remain the lamp in the dining room where the two man the murderous host and the unconscious guest still chat over their cigar every minute that white woolly plain which cover one half of the moor be drift close and close to the house already the first thin wisp of it be curl across the golden square of the light window the farther wall of the orchard be already invisible and the tree be stand out of swirl of white vapour as we watch it the fog wreath came crawl round both corner of the house and roll slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof float like strange ship upon shadowy sea holme strike his hand passionately upon the rock in front of we and stamp his foot in his impatience "if he be n't out in quarter of an hour the path will be cover in half an hour we wo n't be able to see our hand in front of we ""shall we move far back upon high ground?""yes think it would be as well "so as the fog bank flow onward we fall back before it until we be half mile from the house and still that dense white sea with the moon silver its upper edge sweep slowly and inexorably on "we be go too far say holmes we dare not take the chance of his be overtake before he can reach we at all cost we must hold our ground where we be he drop on his knee and clap his ear to the ground thank god think that hear he come "a sound of quick step break the silence of the moor crouch among the stone we stare intently at the silver tipped bank in front of we the step grow louder and through the fog as through curtain there step the man whom we be await he look round he in surprise as he emerge into the clear starlit night then he come swiftly along the path pass close to where we lay and go on up the long slope behind we as he walk he glance continually over either shoulder like man who be ill at ease "hist cry holmes and hear the sharp click of cock pistol look out it be coming!"there be thin crisp continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawl bank the cloud be within fifty yard of where we lay and we glare at it all three uncertain what horror be about to break from the heart of it be at holmes 's elbow and glance for an instant at his face it be pale and exultant his eye shine brightly in the moonlight but suddenly they start forward in rigid fix stare and his lip part in amazement at the same instant lestrade give yell of terror and throw himself face downward upon the ground spring to my foot my inert hand grasp my pistol my mind paralyze by the dreadful shape which have spring out upon we from the shadow of the fog hound it be an enormous coal black hound but not such hound as mortal eye have ever see fire burst from its open mouth its eye glow with smoulder glare its muzzle and hackle and dewlap be outline in flicker flame never in the delirious dream of disorder brain could anything more savage more appalling more hellish be conceive than that dark form and savage face which break upon we out of the wall of fog with long bound the
