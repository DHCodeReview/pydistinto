huge black creature be leap down the track follow hard upon the footstep of our friend so paralyzed be we by the apparition that we allow he to pass before we have recover our nerve then holmes and both fire together and the creature give hideous howl which show that one at least have hit he he do not pause however but bound onward far away on the path we see sir henry look back his face white in the moonlight his hand raise in horror glare helplessly at the frightful thing which be hunt he down but that cry of pain from the hound have blow all our fear to the wind if he be vulnerable he be mortal and if we could wound he we could kill he never have see man run as holmes run that night be reckon fleet of foot but he outpace i as much as outpace the little professional in front of we as we fly up the track we hear scream after scream from sir henry and the deep roar of the hound be in time to see the beast spring upon its victim hurl he to the ground and worry at his throat but the next instant holmes have empty five barrel of his revolver into the creature 's flank with last howl of agony and vicious snap in the air it roll upon its back four foot paw furiously and then fall limp upon its side stoop pant and press my pistol to the dreadful shimmering head but it be useless to press the trigger the giant hound be dead sir henry lie insensible where he have fall we tear away his collar and holmes breathe prayer of gratitude when we see that there be no sign of wound and that the rescue have be in time already our friend 's eyelid shiver and he make feeble effort to move lestrade thrust his brandy flask between the baronet 's tooth and two frightened eye be look up at we "my god he whisper what be it what in heaven 's name be it?""it 's dead whatever it be say holmes we 've lay the family ghost once and forever "in mere size and strength it be terrible creature which be lying stretch before we it be not pure bloodhound and it be not pure mastiff but it appear to be combination of the two gaunt savage and as large as small lioness even now in the stillness of death the huge jaw seem to be dripping with bluish flame and the small deep set cruel eye be ring with fire place my hand upon the glowing muzzle and as hold they up my own finger smoulder and gleam in the darkness "phosphoru say "a cunning preparation of it say holmes sniff at the dead animal there be no smell which might have interfere with his power of scent we owe you deep apology sir henry for having expose you to this fright be prepare for hound but not for such creature as this and the fog give we little time to receive he ""you have save my life ""having first endanger it be you strong enough to stand?""give i another mouthful of that brandy and shall be ready for anything so now if you will help i up what do you propose to do?""to leave you here you be not fit for further adventure tonight if you will wait one or other of we will go back with you to the hall "he try to stagger to his foot but he be still ghastly pale and tremble in every limb we help he to rock where he sat shiver with his face bury in his hand "we must leave you now say holmes the rest of our work must be do and every moment be of importance we have our case and now we only want our man "it be thousand to one against our find he at the house he continue as we retrace our step swiftly down the path those shot must have tell he that the game be up ""we be some distance off and this fog may have deaden they ""he follow the hound to call he off of that you may be certain no no he be go by this time but we 'll search the house and make sure "the front door be open so we rush in and hurry from room to room to the amazement of doddering old manservant who meet we in the passage there be no light save in the dining room but holmes catch up the lamp and leave no corner of the house unexplored no sign could we see of the man whom we be chase on the upper floor however one of the bedroom door be lock "there 's someone in here cry lestrade can hear movement open this door!"a faint moaning and rustling come from within holme strike the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it fly open pistol in hand we all three rush into the room but there be no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expect to see instead we be face by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stand for moment stare at it in amazement the room have be fashion into small museum and the wall be line by number of glass top case full of that collection of butterfly and moth the formation of which have be the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man in the centre of this room there be an upright beam which have be place at some period as support for the old worm eat baulk of timber which span the roof to this post figure be tie so swathe and muffle in the sheet which have be use to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it be that of man or woman one towel pass round the throat and be secure at the back of the pillar another cover the low part of the face and over it two dark eye eye full of grief and shame and dreadful questioning stare back at we in minute we have tear off the gag unswathe the bond and mrs. stapleton sink upon the floor in front of we as her beautiful head fall upon her chest see the clear red weal of whiplash across her neck "the brute cry holmes here lestrade your brandy bottle put she in the chair she have faint from ill usage and exhaustion "she open her eye again "is he safe she ask have he escaped?""he can not escape we madam ""no no do not mean my husband sir henry be he safe?""yes ""and the hound?""it be dead "she give long sigh of satisfaction "thank god thank god oh this villain see how he have treat i she shoot her arm out from her sleeve and we see with horror that they be all mottle with bruise but this be nothing nothing it be my mind and soul that he have torture and defile could endure it all ill usage solitude life of deception everything as long as could still cling to the hope that have his love but now know that in this also have be his dupe and his tool she break into passionate sob as she speak "you bear he no good will madam say holmes tell we then where we shall find he if you have ever aid he in evil help we now and so atone ""there be but one place where he can have flee she answer there be an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire it be there that he keep his hound and there also he have make preparation so that he might have refuge that be where he would fly "the fog bank lie like white wool against the window holme hold the lamp towards it "see say he no one could find his way into the grimpen mire tonight "she laugh and clap her hand her eye and tooth gleam with fierce merriment "he may find his way in but never out she cry how can he see the guide wand tonight we plant they together he and to mark the pathway through the mire oh if could only have pluck they out today then indeed you would have have he at your mercy!"it be evident to we that all pursuit be in vain until the fog have lift meanwhile we leave lestrade in possession of the house while holmes and go back with the baronet to baskerville hall the story of the stapletons could no long be withhold from he but he take the blow bravely when he learn the truth about the woman whom he have love but the shock of the night 's adventure have shatter his nerve and before morning he lie delirious in high fever under the care of dr. mortimer the two of they be destine to travel together round the world before sir henry have become once more the hale hearty man that he have be before he become master of that ill omen estate and now come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative in which have try to make the reader share those dark fear and vague surmise which cloud our life so long and end in so tragic manner on the morning after the death of the hound the fog have lift and we be guide by mrs. stapleton to the point where they have find pathway through the bog it help we to realize the horror of this woman 's life when we see the eagerness and joy with which she lay we on her husband 's track we leave she stand upon the thin peninsula of firm peaty soil which taper out into the widespread bog from the end of it small wand plant here and there show where the path zigzag from tuft to tuft of rush among those green scum pit and foul quagmire which bar the way to the stranger rank reed and lush slimy water plant send an odour of decay and heavy miasmatic vapour onto our face while false step plunge we more than once thigh deep into the dark quiver mire which shake for yard in soft undulation around our foot its tenacious grip pluck at our heel as we walk and when we sink into it it be as if some malignant hand be tug we down into those obscene depth so grim and purposeful be the clutch in which it hold we once only we see trace that someone have pass that perilous way before we from amid tuft of cotton grass which bear it up out of the slime some dark thing be project holme sink to his waist as he step from the path to seize it and have we not be there to drag he out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again he hold an old black boot in the air meyer toronto be print on the leather inside "it be worth mud bath say he it be our friend sir henry 's miss boot ""thrown there by stapleton in his flight ""exactly he retain it in his hand after use it to set the hound upon the track he flee when he know the game be up still clutch it and he hurl it away at this point of his flight we know at least that he come so far in safety "but more than that we be never destine to know though there be much which we might surmise there be no chance of find footstep in the mire for the rise mud ooze swiftly in upon they but as we at last reach firm ground beyond the morass we all look eagerly for they but no slight sign of they ever meet our eye if the earth tell true story then stapleton never reach that island of refuge towards which he struggle through the fog upon that last night somewhere in the heart of the great grimpen mire down in the foul slime of the huge morass which have suck he in this cold and cruel hearted man be forever bury many trace we find of he in the bog girt island where he have hide his savage ally huge driving wheel and shaft half fill with rubbish show the position of an abandon mine beside it be the crumble remain of the cottage of the miner drive away no doubt by the foul reek of the surround swamp in one of these staple and chain with quantity of gnaw bone show where the animal have be confine skeleton with tangle of brown hair adhere to it lie among the debris "a dog say holmes by jove curly haired spaniel poor mortimer will never see his pet again well do not know that this place contain any secret which we have not already fathom he could hide his hound but he could not hush its voice and hence come those cry which even in daylight be not pleasant to hear on an emergency he could keep the hound in the out house at merripit but it be always risk and it be only on the supreme day which he regard as the end of all his effort that he dare do it this paste in the tin be no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature be daub it be suggest of course by the story of the family hell hound and by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death no wonder the poor devil of convict run and scream even as our friend do and as we ourselves might have do when he see such creature bound through the darkness of the moor upon his track it be cunning device for apart from the chance of drive your victim to his death what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such creature should he get sight of it as many have do upon the moor say it in london watson and say it again now that never yet have we help to hunt down more dangerous man than he who be lie yonder he sweep his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green splotch bog which stretch away until it merge into the russet slope of the moor it be the end of november and holmes and sit upon raw and foggy night on either side of blaze fire in our sitting room in baker street since the tragic upshot of our visit to devonshire he have be engage in two affair of the utmost importance in the first of which he have expose the atrocious conduct of colonel upwood in connection with the famous card scandal of the nonpareil club while in the second he have defend the unfortunate mme montpensier from the charge of murder which hang over she in connection with the death of her step daughter mlle carere the young lady who as it will be remember be find six month later alive and marry in new york my friend be in excellent spirit over the success which have attend succession of difficult and important case so that be able to induce he to discuss the detail of the baskerville mystery have wait patiently for the opportunity for be aware that he would never permit case to overlap and that his clear and logical mind would not be draw from its present work to dwell upon memory of the past sir henry and dr. mortimer be however in london on their way to that long voyage which have be recommend for the restoration of his shatter nerve they have call upon we that very afternoon so that it be natural that the subject should come up for discussion "the whole course of event say holmes from the point of view of the man who call himself stapleton be simple and direct although to we who have no mean in the beginning of know the motive of his action and could only learn part of the fact it all appear exceedingly complex have have the advantage of two conversation with mrs. stapleton and the case have now be so entirely clear up that be not aware that there be anything which have remain secret to we you will find few note upon the matter under the head in my indexed list of case ""perhaps you would kindly give i sketch of the course of event from memory ""certainly though can not guarantee that carry all the fact in my mind intense mental concentration have curious way of blot out what have pass the barrister who have his case at his finger end and be able to argue with an expert upon his own subject find that week or two of the court will drive it all out of his head once more so each of my case displace the last and mlle carere have blur my recollection of baskerville hall tomorrow some other little problem may be submit to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair french lady and the infamous upwood so far as the case of the hound go however will give you the course of event as nearly as can and you will suggest anything which may have forget "my inquiry show beyond all question that the family portrait do not lie and that this fellow be indeed baskerville he be son of that rodger baskerville the young brother of sir charles who flee with sinister reputation to south america where he be say to have die unmarried he do as matter of fact marry and have one child this fellow whose real name be the same as his father 's he marry beryl garcia one of the beauty of costa rica and having purloin considerable sum of public money he change his name to vandeleur and flee to england where he establish school in the east of yorkshire his reason for attempt this special line of business be that he have strike up an acquaintance with consumptive tutor upon the voyage home and that he have use this man 's ability to make the undertaking success fraser the tutor die however and the school which have begin well sink from disrepute into infamy the vandeleurs find it convenient to change their name to stapleton and he bring the remain of his fortune his scheme for the future and his taste for entomology to the south of england learn at the british museum that he be recognize authority upon the subject and that the name of vandeleur have be permanently attach to certain moth which he have in his yorkshire day be the first to describe "we now come to that portion of his life which have prove to be of such intense interest to we the fellow have evidently make inquiry and find that only two life intervene between he and valuable estate when he go to devonshire his plan be believe exceedingly hazy but that he mean mischief from the first be evident from the way in which he take his wife with he in the character of his sister the idea of use she as decoy be clearly already in his mind though he may not have be certain how the detail of his plot be to be arrange he mean in the end to have the estate and he be ready to use any tool or run any risk for that end his first act be to establish himself as near to his ancestral home as he could and his second be to cultivate friendship with sir charles baskerville and with the neighbour "the baronet himself tell he about the family hound and so prepare the way for his own death stapleton as will continue to call he know that the old man 's heart be weak and that shock would kill he so much he have learn from dr. mortimer he have hear also that sir charles be superstitious and have take this grim legend very seriously his ingenious mind instantly suggest way by which the baronet could be do to death and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer "having conceive the idea he proceed to carry it out with considerable finesse an ordinary schemer would have be content to work with savage hound the use of artificial mean to make the creature diabolical be flash of genius upon his part the dog he buy in london from ross and mangles the dealer in fulham road it be the strong and most savage in their possession he bring it down by the north devon line and walk great distance over the moor so as to get it home without excite any remark he have already on his insect hunt learn to penetrate the grimpen mire and so have find safe hiding place for the creature here he kennel it and wait his chance "but it be some time come the old gentleman could not be decoy outside of his ground at night several time stapleton lurk about with his hound but without avail it be during these fruitless quest that he or rather his ally be see by peasant and that the legend of the demon dog receive new confirmation he have hope that his wife might lure sir charles to his ruin but here she prove unexpectedly independent she would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in sentimental attachment which might deliver he over to his enemy threat and even be sorry to say blow refuse to move she she would have nothing to do with it and for time stapleton be at deadlock "he find way out of his difficulty through the chance that sir charles who have conceive friendship for he make he the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman mrs. laura lyons by represent himself as single man he acquire complete influence over she and he give she to understand that in the event of she obtain divorce from her husband he would marry she his plan be suddenly bring to head by his knowledge that sir charles be about to leave the hall on the advice of dr. mortimer with whose opinion he himself pretend to coincide he must act at once or his victim might get beyond his power he therefore put pressure upon mrs. lyons to write this letter implore the old man to give she an interview on the evening before his departure for london he then by specious argument prevent she from go and so have the chance for which he have wait "drive back in the evening from coombe tracey he be in time to get his hound to treat it with his infernal paint and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he have reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman wait the dog incite by its master spring over the wicket gate and pursue the unfortunate baronet who flee scream down the yew alley in that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have be dreadful sight to see that huge black creature with its flame jaw and blaze eye bound after its victim he fall dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and terror the hound have keep upon the grassy border while the baronet have run down the path so that no track but the man 's be visible on see he lie still the creature have probably approach to sniff at he but find he dead have turn away again it be then that it leave the print which be actually observe by dr. mortimer the hound be call off and hurry away to its lair in the grimpen mire and mystery be leave which puzzle the authority alarm the countryside and finally bring the case within the scope of our observation "so much for the death of sir charles baskerville you perceive the devilish cunning of it for really it would be almost impossible to make case against the real murderer his only accomplice be one who could never give he away and the grotesque inconceivable nature of the device only serve to make it more effective both of the woman concern in the case mrs. stapleton and mrs. laura lyons be leave with strong suspicion against stapleton mrs. stapleton know that he have design upon the old man and also of the existence of the hound mrs. lyons know neither of these thing but have be impress by the death occur at the time of an uncancelled appointment which be only know to he however both of they be under his influence and he have nothing to fear from they the first half of his task be successfully accomplish but the more difficult still remain "it be possible that stapleton do not know of the existence of an heir in canada in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr. mortimer and he be tell by the latter all detail about the arrival of henry baskerville stapleton 's first idea be that this young stranger from canada might possibly be do to death in london without come down to devonshire at all he distrust his wife ever since she have refuse to help he in lay trap for the old man and he dared not leave she long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over she
