and be admit by my faithful lal chowdar who be now dead morstan and have difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure and we come to heated word morstan have spring out of his chair in paroxysm of anger when he suddenly press his hand to his side his face turn dusky hue and he fall backwards cut his head against the corner of the treasure chest when stoop over he find to my horror that he be dead "'for long time sit half distracted wonder what should do my first impulse be of course to call for assistance but could not but recognize that there be every chance that would be accuse of his murder his death at the moment of quarrel and the gash in his head would be black against i again an official inquiry could not be make without bring out some fact about the treasure which be particularly anxious to keep secret he have tell i that no soul upon earth know where he have go there seem to be no necessity why any soul ever should know "'i be still ponder over the matter when look up see my servant lal chowdar in the doorway he steal in and bolt the door behind he do not fear sahib he say no one need know that you have kill he let we hide he away and who be the wise do not kill he say i. lal chowdar shake his head and smile hear it all sahib say he hear you quarrel and hear the blow but my lip be seal all be asleep in the house let we put he away together that be enough to decide i if my own servant could not believe my innocence how could hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesman in jury box lal chowdar and dispose of the body that night and within few day the london paper be full of the mysterious disappearance of captain morstan you will see from what say that can hardly be blame in the matter my fault lie in the fact that we conceal not only the body but also the treasure and that have clung to morstan 's share as well as to my own wish you therefore to make restitution put your ear down to my mouth the treasure be hide in at this instant horrible change come over his expression his eye stare wildly his jaw drop and he yell in voice which can never forget keep he out for christ 's sake keep he out we both stare round at the window behind we upon which his gaze be fix face be look in at we out of the darkness we could see the whitening of the nose where it be press against the glass it be bearded hairy face with wild cruel eye and an expression of concentrated malevolence my brother and rush towards the window but the man be go when we return to my father his head have drop and his pulse have cease to beat "we search the garden that night but find no sign of the intruder save that just under the window single footmark be visible in the flower bed but for that one trace we might have think that our imagination have conjure up that wild fierce face we soon however have another and more striking proof that there be secret agency at work all round we the window of my father 's room be find open in the morning his cupboard and box have be rifle and upon his chest be fix torn piece of paper with the word the sign of the four scrawl across it what the phrase mean or who our secret visitor may have be we never know as far as we can judge none of my father 's property have be actually steal though everything have be turn out my brother and naturally associate this peculiar incident with the fear which haunt my father during his life but it be still complete mystery to we "the little man stop to relight his hookah and puff thoughtfully for few moment we have all sat absorb listen to his extraordinary narrative at the short account of her father 's death miss morstan have turn deadly white and for moment fear that she be about to faint she rally however on drink glass of water which quietly pour out for she from venetian carafe upon the side table sherlock holmes lean back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lid draw low over his glitter eye as glance at he could not but think how on that very day he have complain bitterly of the commonplaceness of life here at least be problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost mr. thaddeus sholto look from one to the other of we with an obvious pride at the effect which his story have produce and then continue between the puff of his overgrown pipe "my brother and say he be as you may imagine much excited as to the treasure which my father have speak of for week and for month we dig and delve in every part of the garden without discover its whereabouts it be madden to think that the hiding place be on his very lip at the moment that he die we could judge the splendor of the miss rich by the chaplet which he have take out over this chaplet my brother bartholomew and have some little discussion the pearl be evidently of great value and he be averse to part with they for between friend my brother be himself little inclined to my father 's fault he think too that if we part with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring we into trouble it be all that could do to persuade he to let i find out miss morstan 's address and send she detach pearl at fix interval so that at least she might never feel destitute ""it be kindly thought say our companion earnestly it be extremely good of you "the little man wave his hand deprecatingly we be your trustee he say that be the view which take of it though brother bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light we have plenty of money ourselves desire no more besides it would have be such bad taste to have treat young lady in so scurvy fashion le mauvais gout mene au crime the french have very neat way of put these thing our difference of opinion on this subject go so far that think it well to set up room for myself so leave pondicherry lodge take the old khitmutgar and williams with i yesterday however learn that an event of extreme importance have occur the treasure have be discover instantly communicate with miss morstan and it only remain for we to drive out to norwood and demand our share explain my view last night to brother bartholomew so we shall be expect if not welcome visitor "mr thaddeus sholto cease and sit twitch on his luxurious settee we all remain silent with our thought upon the new development which the mysterious business have take holmes be the first to spring to his foot "you have do well sir from first to last say he it be possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throw some light upon that which be still dark to you but as miss morstan remark just now it be late and we have well put the matter through without delay "our new acquaintance very deliberately coil up the tube of his hookah and produce from behind curtain very long befrogged topcoat with astrakhan collar and cuff this he button tightly up in spite of the extreme closeness of the night and finish his attire by put on rabbit skin cap with hang lappet which cover the ear so that no part of he be visible save his mobile and peaky face my health be somewhat fragile he remark as he lead the way down the passage be compel to be valetudinarian "our cab be await we outside and our programme be evidently prearrange for the driver start off at once at rapid pace thaddeus sholto talk incessantly in voice which rise high above the rattle of the wheel "bartholomew be clever fellow say he how do you think he find out where the treasure be he have come to the conclusion that it be somewhere indoor so he work out all the cubic space of the house and make measurement everywhere so that not one inch should be unaccounted for among other thing he find that the height of the building be seventy four foot but on add together the height of all the separate room and make every allowance for the space between which he ascertain by boring he could not bring the total to more than seventy foot there be four foot unaccounted for these could only be at the top of the building he knock hole therefore in the lath and plaster ceiling of the high room and there sure enough he come upon another little garret above it which have be seal up and be know to no one in the centre stand the treasure chest rest upon two rafter he lower it through the hole and there it lie he compute the value of the jewel at not less than half million sterling "at the mention of this gigantic sum we all stare at one another open eyed miss morstan could we secure her right would change from needy governess to the rich heiress in england surely it be the place of loyal friend to rejoice at such news yet be ashamed to say that selfishness take i by the soul and that my heart turn as heavy as lead within i stammer out some few halting word of congratulation and then sit downcast with my head droop deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance he be clearly confirmed hypochondriac and be dreamily conscious that he be pour forth interminable train of symptom and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrum some of which he bear about in leather case in his pocket trust that he may not remember any of the answer which give he that night holme declare that he overhear i caution he against the great danger of take more than two drop of castor oil while recommend strychnine in large dose as sedative however that may be be certainly relieve when our cab pull up with jerk and the coachman spring down to open the door "this miss morstan be pondicherry lodge say mr. thaddeus sholto as he hand she out it be nearly eleven o'clock when we reach this final stage of our night 's adventure we have leave the damp fog of the great city behind we and the night be fairly fine warm wind blow from the westward and heavy cloud move slowly across the sky with half moon peep occasionally through the rift it be clear enough to see for some distance but thaddeus sholto take down one of the side lamp from the carriage to give we well light upon our way pondicherry lodge stand in its own ground and be girt round with very high stone wall top with broken glass single narrow iron clamp door form the only mean of entrance on this our guide knock with peculiar postman like rat tat "who be there cry gruff voice from within "it be mcmurdo you surely know my knock by this time "there be grumble sound and clanking and jarring of key the door swing heavily back and short deep cheste man stand in the opening with the yellow light of the lantern shine upon his protrude face and twinkle distrustful eye "that you mr. thaddeus but who be the other have no order about they from the master ""no mcmurdo you surprise i tell my brother last night that should bring some friend ""he ai n't be out his room to day mr. thaddeus and have no order you know very well that must stick to regulation can let you in but your friend must just stop where they be "this be an unexpected obstacle thaddeus sholto look about he in perplexed and helpless manner this be too bad of you mcmurdo he say if guarantee they that be enough for you there be the young lady too she can not wait on the public road at this hour ""very sorry mr. thaddeus say the porter inexorably folk may be friend yours and yet no friend the master 's he pay i well to do my duty and my duty 'll do do n't know none your friend ""oh yes you do mcmurdo cry sherlock holmes genially do n't think you can have forget i do n't you remember the amateur who fight three round with you at alison 's room on the night of your benefit four year back?""not mr. sherlock holmes roar the prize fighter god 's truth how could have mistake you if instead standin there so quiet you have just step up and give i that cross hit of your under the jaw 'd ha know you without question ah you be one that have waste your gift you have you might have aim high if you have join the fancy ""you see watson if all else fail i have still one of the scientific profession open to i say holmes laugh our friend wo n't keep we out in the cold now be sure ""in you come sir in you come you and your friend he answer very sorry mr. thaddeus but order be very strict have to be certain of your friend before let they in "inside gravel path wind through desolate ground to huge clump of house square and prosaic all plunge in shadow save where moonbeam strike one corner and glimmer in garret window the vast size of the building with its gloom and its deathly silence strike chill to the heart even thaddeus sholto seem ill at ease and the lantern quiver and rattle in his hand "i can not understand it he say there must be some mistake distinctly tell bartholomew that we should be here and yet there be no light in his window do not know what to make of it ""does he always guard the premise in this way ask holmes "yes he have follow my father 's custom he be the favorite son you know and sometimes think that my father may have tell he more than he ever tell i that be bartholomew 's window up there where the moonshine strike it be quite bright but there be no light from within think ""none say holmes but see the glint of light in that little window beside the door ""ah that be the housekeeper 's room that be where old mrs. bernstone sit she can tell we all about it but perhaps you would not mind wait here for minute or two for if we all go in together and she have no word of our come she may be alarm but hush what be that?"he hold up the lantern and his hand shake until the circle of light flicker and waver all round we miss morstan seize my wrist and we all stand with thumping heart strain our ear from the great black house there sound through the silent night the sad and most pitiful of sound the shrill break whimpering of frightened woman "it be mrs. bernstone say sholto she be the only woman in the house wait here shall be back in moment he hurry for the door and knock in his peculiar way we could see tall old woman admit he and sway with pleasure at the very sight of he "oh mr. thaddeus sir be so glad you have come be so glad you have come mr. thaddeus sir we hear her reiterate rejoicing until the door be closed and her voice die away into muffled monotone our guide have leave we the lantern holme swing it slowly round and peer keenly at the house and at the great rubbish heap which cumber the ground miss morstan and stand together and her hand be in mine wondrous subtle thing be love for here be we two who have never see each other before that day between whom no word or even look of affection have ever pass and yet now in an hour of trouble our hand instinctively seek for each other have marvel at it since but at the time it seem the most natural thing that should go out to she so and as she have often tell i there be in she also the instinct to turn to i for comfort and protection so we stand hand in hand like two child and there be peace in our heart for all the dark thing that surround we "what strange place she say look round "it look as though all the mole in england have be let loose in it have see something of the sort on the side of hill near ballarat where the prospector have be at work ""and from the same cause say holmes these be the trace of the treasure seeker you must remember that they be six year look for it no wonder that the ground look like gravel pit "at that moment the door of the house burst open and thaddeus sholto came run out with his hand throw forward and terror in his eye "there be something amiss with bartholomew he cry be frightened my nerve can not stand it he be indeed half blubber with fear and his twitch feeble face peep out from the great astrakhan collar have the helpless appealing expression of terrified child "come into the house say holmes in his crisp firm way "yes do plead thaddeus sholto really do not feel equal to give direction "we all follow he into the housekeeper 's room which stand upon the left hand side of the passage the old woman be pace up and down with scared look and restless picking finger but the sight of miss morstan appear to have soothe effect upon she "god bless your sweet calm face she cry with an hysterical sob it do i good to see you oh but have be sorely try this day!"our companion pat she thin work wear hand and murmur some few word of kindly womanly comfort which bring the color back into the other bloodless cheek "master have lock himself in and will not answer i she explain all day have wait to hear from he for he often like to be alone but an hour ago fear that something be amiss so go up and peep through the key hole you must go up mr. thaddeus you must go up and look for yourself have see mr. bartholomew sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long year but never see he with such face on he as that "sherlock holmes take the lamp and lead the way for thaddeus sholto 's tooth be chatter in his head so shake be he that have to pass my hand under his arm as we go up the stair for his knee be tremble under he twice as we ascend holmes whip his lens out of his pocket and carefully examine mark which appear to i to be mere shapeless smudge of dust upon the cocoa nut matting which serve as stair carpet he walk slowly from step to step hold the lamp and shoot keen glance to right and leave miss morstan have remain behind with the frightened housekeeper the third flight of stair end in straight passage of some length with great picture in indian tapestry upon the right of it and three door upon the left holme advance along it in the same slow and methodical way while we keep close at his heel with our long black shadow streaming backwards down the corridor the third door be that which we be seek holme knock without receive any answer and then try to turn the handle and force it open it be lock on the inside however and by broad and powerful bolt as we could see when we set our lamp up against it the key be turn however the hole be not entirely closed sherlock holmes bend down to it and instantly rise again with sharp intaking of the breath "there be something devilish in this watson say he more moved than have ever before see he what do you make of it?"i stoop to the hole and recoil in horror moonlight be stream into the room and it be bright with vague and shifty radiance look straight at i and suspend as it be in the air for all beneath be in shadow there hang face the very face of our companion thaddeus there be the same high shine head the same circular bristle of red hair the same bloodless countenance the feature be set however in horrible smile fixed and unnatural grin which in that still and moonlit room be more jarring to the nerve than any scowl or contortion so like be the face to that of our little friend that look round at he to make sure that he be indeed with we then recall to mind that he have mention to we that his brother and he be twin "this be terrible say to holmes what be to be done?""the door must come down he answer and spring against it he put all his weight upon the lock it creak and groan but do not yield together we fling ourselves upon it once more and this time it give way with sudden snap and we find ourselves within bartholomew sholto 's chamber it appear to have be fit up as chemical laboratory double line of glass stopper bottle be draw up upon the wall opposite the door and the table be litter over with bunsen burner test tube and retort in the corner stand carboy of acid in wicker basket one of these appear to leak or to have be break for stream of dark color liquid have trickle out from it and the air be heavy with peculiarly pungent tar like odor set of step stand at one side of the room in the midst of litter of lath and plaster and above they there be an opening in the ceiling large enough for man to pass through at the foot of the step long coil of rope be throw carelessly together by the table in wooden arm chair the master of the house be seat all in heap with his head sink upon his left shoulder and that ghastly inscrutable smile upon his face he be stiff and cold and have clearly be dead many hour it seem to i that not only his feature but all his limb be twist and turn in the most fantastic fashion by his hand upon the table there lie peculiar instrument brown close grained stick with stone head like hammer rudely lash on with coarse twine beside it be torn sheet of note paper with some word scrawl upon it holme glance at it and then hand it to i "you see he say with significant raising of the eyebrow in the light of the lantern read with thrill of horror the sign of the four ""in god 's name what do it all mean ask "it mean murder say he stoop over the dead man ah expect it look here he point to what look like long dark thorn stick in the skin just
