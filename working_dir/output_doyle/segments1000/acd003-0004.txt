"they be hellish thing say he look out that you do n't prick yourself be delighted to have they for the chance be that they be all he have there be the less fear of you or i find one in our skin before long would soon face martini bullet myself be you game for six mile trudge watson?""certainly answer "your leg will stand it?""oh yes ""here you be doggy good old toby smell it toby smell it he push the creasote handkerchief under the dog 's nose while the creature stand with its fluffy leg separate and with most comical cock to its head like connoisseur sniff the bouquet of famous vintage holme then throw the handkerchief to distance fasten stout cord to the mongrel 's collar and lead he to the foot of the water barrel the creature instantly break into succession of high tremulous yelp and with his nose on the ground and his tail in the air patter off upon the trail at pace which strain his leash and keep we at the top of our speed the east have be gradually whiten and we could now see some distance in the cold gray light the square massive house with its black empty window and high bare wall tower up sad and forlorn behind we our course lead right across the ground in and out among the trench and pit with which they be scarred and intersect the whole place with its scatter dirt heap and ill grow shrub have blight ill omen look which harmonize with the black tragedy which hang over it on reach the boundary wall toby run along whine eagerly underneath its shadow and stop finally in corner screen by young beech where the two wall join several brick have be loosen and the crevice leave be wear down and round upon the low side as though they have frequently be use as ladder holme clamber up and take the dog from i he drop it over upon the other side "there be the print of wooden leg 's hand he remark as mount up beside he you see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster what lucky thing it be that we have have no very heavy rain since yesterday the scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight and twenty hour start "i confess that have my doubt myself when reflect upon the great traffic which have pass along the london road in the interval my fear be soon appeased however toby never hesitate or swerve but waddle on in his peculiar rolling fashion clearly the pungent smell of the creasote rise high above all other contend scent "do not imagine say holmes that depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellow having put his foot in the chemical have knowledge now which would enable i to trace they in many different way this however be the ready and since fortune have put it into our hand should be culpable if neglect it it have however prevent the case from become the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promise to be there might have be some credit to be gain out of it but for this too palpable clue ""there be credit and to spare say i. assure you holmes that marvel at the mean by which you obtain your result in this case even more than do in the jefferson hope murder the thing seem to i to be deep and more inexplicable how for example could you describe with such confidence the wooden legged man?""pshaw my dear boy it be simplicity itself do n't wish to be theatrical it be all patent and above board two officer who be in command of convict guard learn an important secret as to bury treasure map be draw for they by an englishman name jonathan small you remember that we see the name upon the chart in captain morstan 's possession he have sign it in behalf of himself and his associate the sign of the four as he somewhat dramatically call it aid by this chart the officer or one of they get the treasure and bring it to england leave we will suppose some condition under which he receive it unfulfilled now then why do not jonathan small get the treasure himself the answer be obvious the chart be date at time when morstan be bring into close association with convict jonathan small do not get the treasure because he and his associate be themselves convict and could not get away ""but that be mere speculation say i."it be more than that it be the only hypothesis which cover the fact let we see how it fit in with the sequel major sholto remain at peace for some year happy in the possession of his treasure then he receive letter from india which give he great fright what be that?""a letter to say that the man whom he have wrong have be set free ""or have escape that be much more likely for he would have know what their term of imprisonment be it would not have be surprise to he what do he do then he guard himself against wooden legged man white man mark you for he mistake white tradesman for he and actually fire pistol at he now only one white man 's name be on the chart the other be hindoos or mohammedans there be no other white man therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden legged man be identical with jonathan small do the reasoning strike you as be faulty?""no it be clear and concise ""well now let we put ourselves in the place of jonathan small let we look at it from his point of view he come to england with the double idea of regain what he would consider to be his right and of have his revenge upon the man who have wrong he he find out where sholto live and very possibly he establish communication with some one inside the house there be this butler lal rao whom we have not see mrs. bernstone give he far from good character small could not find out however where the treasure be hide for no one ever know save the major and one faithful servant who have die suddenly small learn that the major be on his death bed in frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with he he run the gauntlet of the guard make his way to the die man 's window and be only deter from enter by the presence of his two son mad with hate however against the dead man he enter the room that night search his private paper in the hope of discover some memorandum relate to the treasure and finally leave momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card he have doubtless plan beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as sign that it be not common murder but from the point of view of the four associate something in the nature of an act of justice whimsical and bizarre conceit of this kind be common enough in the annal of crime and usually afford valuable indication as to the criminal do you follow all this?""very clearly ""now what could jonathan small do he could only continue to keep secret watch upon the effort make to find the treasure possibly he leave england and only come back at interval then come the discovery of the garret and he be instantly inform of it we again trace the presence of some confederate in the household jonathan with his wooden leg be utterly unable to reach the lofty room of bartholomew sholto he take with he however rather curious associate who get over this difficulty but dip his naked foot into creasote whence come toby and six mile limp for half pay officer with damage tendo achillis ""but it be the associate and not jonathan who commit the crime ""quite so and rather to jonathan 's disgust to judge by the way he stamp about when he get into the room he bear no grudge against bartholomew sholto and would have prefer if he could have be simply bind and gag he do not wish to put his head in halter there be no help for it however the savage instinct of his companion have break out and the poison have do its work so jonathan small leave his record lower the treasure box to the ground and follow it himself that be the train of event as far as can decipher they of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle aged and must be sunburn after serve his time in such an oven as the andamans his height be readily calculate from the length of his stride and we know that he be bearded his hairiness be the one point which impress itself upon thaddeus sholto when he see he at the window do n't know that there be anything else ""the associate?""ah well there be no great mystery in that but you will know all about it soon enough how sweet the morning air be see how that one little cloud float like pink feather from some gigantic flamingo now the red rim of the sun push itself over the london cloud bank it shine on good many folk but on none dare bet who be on strange errand than you and i. how small we feel with our petty ambition and striving in the presence of the great elemental force of nature be you well up in your jean paul?""fairly so work back to he through carlyle ""that be like follow the brook to the parent lake he make one curious but profound remark it be that the chief proof of man 's real greatness lie in his perception of his own smallness it argue you see power of comparison and of appreciation which be in itself proof of nobility there be much food for thought in richter you have not pistol have you?""i have my stick ""it be just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair jonathan shall leave to you but if the other turn nasty shall shoot he dead he take out his revolver as he speak and having load two of the chamber he put it back into the right hand pocket of his jacket we have during this time be follow the guidance of toby down the half rural villa line road which lead to the metropolis now however we be begin to come among continuous street where laborer and dockman be already astir and slatternly woman be take down shutter and brush door step at the square top corner public house business be just begin and rough look man be emerge rub their sleeve across their beard after their morning wet strange dog saunter up and stare wonderingly at we as we pass but our inimitable toby look neither to the right nor to the left but trot onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which speak of hot scent we have traverse streatham brixton camberwell and now find ourselves in kennington lane having bear away through the side street to the east of the oval the man whom we pursue seem to have take curiously zigzag road with the idea probably of escape observation they have never keep to the main road if parallel side street would serve their turn at the foot of kennington lane they have edge away to the left through bond street and miles street where the latter street turn into knight 's place toby cease to advance but begin to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping the very picture of canine indecision then he waddle round in circle look up to we from time to time as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment "what the deuce be the matter with the dog growl holmes they surely would not take cab or go off in balloon ""perhaps they stand here for some time suggest "ah it be all right he be off again say my companion in tone of relief he be indeed off for after sniff round again he suddenly make up his mind and dart away with an energy and determination such as he have not yet show the scent appear to be much hot than before for he have not even to put his nose on the ground but tug at his leash and try to break into run cold see by the gleam in holmes 's eye that he think we be near the end of our journey our course now run down nine elms until we come to broderick and nelson 's large timber yard just past the white eagle tavern here the dog frantic with excitement turn down through the side gate into the enclosure where the sawyer be already at work on the dog race through sawdust and shaving down an alley round passage between two wood pile and finally with triumphant yelp spring upon large barrel which still stand upon the hand trolley on which it have be bring with loll tongue and blink eye toby stand upon the cask look from one to the other of we for some sign of appreciation the stave of the barrel and the wheel of the trolley be smear with dark liquid and the whole air be heavy with the smell of creasote sherlock holmes and look blankly at each other and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter "what now ask toby have lose his character for infallibility ""he act accord to his light say holmes lift he down from the barrel and walk he out of the timber yard if you consider how much creasote be cart about london in one day it be no great wonder that our trail should have be cross it be much use now especially for the seasoning of wood poor toby be not to blame ""we must get on the main scent again suppose ""yes and fortunately we have no distance to go evidently what puzzle the dog at the corner of knight 's place be that there be two different trail run in opposite direction we take the wrong one it only remain to follow the other "there be no difficulty about this on lead toby to the place where he have commit his fault he cast about in wide circle and finally dash off in fresh direction "we must take care that he do not now bring we to the place where the creasote barrel come from observe "i have think of that but you notice that he keep on the pavement whereas the barrel pass down the roadway no we be on the true scent now "it tend down towards the river side run through belmont place and prince 's street at the end of broad street it run right down to the water 's edge where there be small wooden wharf toby lead we to the very edge of this and there stand whine look out on the dark current beyond "we be out of luck say holmes they have take to boat here several small punt and skiff be lie about in the water and on the edge of the wharf we take toby round to each in turn but though he sniff earnestly he make no sign close to the rude landing stage be small brick house with wooden placard sling out through the second window mordecai smith be print across it in large letter and underneath boat to hire by the hour or day second inscription above the door inform we that steam launch be keep statement which be confirm by great pile of coke upon the jetty sherlock holmes look slowly round and his face assume an ominous expression "this look bad say he these fellow be sharp than expect they seem to have cover their track there have fear be preconcerte management here "he be approach the door of the house when it open and little curly head lad of six come run out follow by stoutish red face woman with large sponge in her hand "you come back and be wash jack she shout come back you young imp for if your father come home and find you like that he 'll let we hear of it ""dear little chap say holmes strategically what rosy cheek young rascal now jack be there anything you would like?"the youth ponder for moment 'd like shillin say he "nothing you would like better?""i'd like two shillin well the prodigy answer after some thought "here you be then catch fine child mrs. smith!""lor bless you sir he be that and forward he get a'most too much for i to manage specially when my man be away day at time ""away be he say holmes in disappointed voice be sorry for that for want to speak to mr. smith ""he be be away since yesterday mornin sir and truth to tell be beginnin to feel frightened about he but if it be about boat sir maybe could serve as well ""i want
