but still the aurora thunder on and still we follow close upon her track "pile it on man pile it on cry holmes look down into the engine room while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager aquiline face get every pound of steam you can ""i think we gain little say jones with his eye on the aurora "i be sure of it say i. we shall be up with she in very few minute "at that moment however as our evil fate would have it tug with three barge in tow blunder in between we it be only by put our helm hard down that we avoid collision and before we could round they and recover our way the aurora have gain good two hundred yard she be still however well in view and the murky uncertain twilight be set into clear starlit night our boiler be strain to their utmost and the frail shell vibrate and creak with the fierce energy which be drive we along we have shoot through the pool past the west india docks down the long deptford reach and up again after round the isle of dogs the dull blur in front of we resolve itself now clearly enough into the dainty aurora jones turn our search light upon she so that we could plainly see the figure upon her deck one man sit by the stern with something black between his knee over which he stoop beside he lie dark mass which look like newfoundland dog the boy hold the tiller while against the red glare of the furnace could see old smith strip to the waist and shovel coal for dear life they may have have some doubt at first as to whether we be really pursue they but now as we follow every winding and turn which they take there could no long be any question about it at greenwich we be about three hundred pace behind they at blackwall we could not have be more than two hundred and fifty have course many creature in many country during my checker career but never do sport give i such wild thrill as this mad fly man hunt down the thames steadily we draw in upon they yard by yard in the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery the man in the stern still crouch upon the deck and his arm be move as though he be busy while every now and then he would look up and measure with glance the distance which still separate we nearer we come and near jones yell to they to stop we be not more than four boat 's length behind they both boat fly at tremendous pace it be clear reach of the river with barking level upon one side and the melancholy plumstead marsh upon the other at our hail the man in the stern spring up from the deck and shake his two clinched fist at we curse the while in high cracked voice he be good sized powerful man and as he stand poise himself with leg astride could see that from the thigh downward there be but wooden stump upon the right side at the sound of his strident angry cry there be movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck it straighten itself into little black man the small have ever see with great misshapen head and shock of tangle dishevelled hair holme have already draw his revolver and whip out mine at the sight of this savage distorted creature he be wrap in some sort of dark ulster or blanket which leave only his face expose but that face be enough to give man sleepless night never have see feature so deeply mark with all bestiality and cruelty his small eye glow and burn with sombre light and his thick lip be writhe back from his tooth which grin and chatter at we with half animal fury "fire if he raise his hand say holmes quietly we be within boat' length by this time and almost within touch of our quarry can see the two of they now as they stand the white man with his leg far apart shriek out curse and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face and his strong yellow tooth gnash at we in the light of our lantern it be well that we have so clear view of he even as we look he pluck out from under his cover short round piece of wood like school ruler and clap it to his lip our pistol ring out together he whirl round throw up his arm and with kind of choke cough fall sideways into the stream catch one glimpse of his venomous menacing eye amid the white swirl of the water at the same moment the wooden legged man throw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down so that his boat make straight in for the southern bank while we shoot past her stern only clear she by few foot we be round after she in an instant but she be already nearly at the bank it be wild and desolate place where the moon glimmer upon wide expanse of marsh land with pool of stagnant water and bed of decay vegetation the launch with dull thud run up upon the mud bank with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water the fugitive spring out but his stump instantly sink its whole length into the sodden soil in vain he struggle and writhe not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards he yell in impotent rage and kick frantically into the mud with his other foot but his struggle only bore his wooden pin the deep into the sticky bank when we bring our launch alongside he be so firmly anchor that it be only by throw the end of rope over his shoulder that we be able to haul he out and to drag he like some evil fish over our side the two smiths father and son sit sullenly in their launch but come aboard meekly enough when command the aurora herself we haul off and make fast to our stern solid iron chest of indian workmanship stand upon the deck this there could be no question be the same that have contain the ill omen treasure of the sholtos there be no key but it be of considerable weight so we transfer it carefully to our own little cabin as we steam slowly up stream again we flash our search light in every direction but there be no sign of the islander somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the thames lie the bone of that strange visitor to our shore "see here say holmes point to the wooden hatchway we be hardly quick enough with our pistol there sure enough just behind where we have be stand stick one of those murderous dart which we know so well it must have whiz between we at the instant that we fire holme smile at it and shrug his shoulder in his easy fashion but confess that it turn i sick to think of the horrible death which have pass so close to we that night our captive sit in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he have do so much and wait so long to gain he be sunburned reckless eyed fellow with net work of line and wrinkle all over his mahogany feature which tell of hard open air life there be singular prominence about his bearded chin which mark man who be not to be easily turn from his purpose his age may have be fifty or thereabout for his black curly hair be thickly shoot with gray his face in repose be not an unpleasing one though his heavy brow and aggressive chin give he as have lately see terrible expression when move to anger he sit now with his handcuff hand upon his lap and his head sink upon his breast while he look with his keen twinkle eye at the box which have be the cause of his ill doing it seem to i that there be more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contain countenance once he look up at i with gleam of something like humor in his eye "well jonathan small say holmes light cigar be sorry that it have come to this ""and so be sir he answer frankly do n't believe that can swing over the job give you my word on the book that never raise hand against mr. sholto it be that little hell hound tonga who shoot one of his cursed dart into he have no part in it sir be as grieve as if it have be my blood relation welt the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it but it be do and could not undo it again ""have cigar say holmes and you have well take pull out of my flask for you be very wet how could you expect so small and weak man as this black fellow to overpower mr. sholto and hold he while you be climb the rope?""you seem to know as much about it as if you be there sir the truth be that hope to find the room clear know the habit of the house pretty well and it be the time when mr. sholto usually go down to his supper shall make no secret of the business the good defence that can make be just the simple truth now if it have be the old major would have swing for he with light heart would have think no more of knife he than of smoke this cigar but it be curse hard that should be lag over this young sholto with whom have no quarrel whatever ""you be under the charge of mr. athelney jones of scotland yard he be go to bring you up to my room and shall ask you for true account of the matter you must make clean breast of it for if you do hope that may be of use to you think can prove that the poison act so quickly that the man be dead before ever you reach the room ""that he be sir never get such turn in my life as when see he grin at i with his head on his shoulder as climb through the window it fairly shake i sir 'd have half kill tonga for it if he have not scramble off that be how he come to leave his club and some of his dart too as he tell i which dare say help to put you on our track though how you keep on it be more than can tell do n't feel no malice against you for it but it do seem queer thing he add with bitter smile that who have fair claim to nigh upon half million of money should spend the first half of my life build breakwater in the andamans and be like to spend the other half dig drain at dartmoor it be an evil day for i when first clap eye upon the merchant achmet and have to do with the agra treasure which never bring anything but curse yet upon the man who own it to he it bring murder to major sholto it bring fear and guilt to i it have mean slavery for life "at this moment athelney jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulder into the tiny cabin quite family party he remark think shall have pull at that flask holmes well think we may all congratulate each other pity we do n't take the other alive but there be no choice say holmes you must confess that you cut it rather fine it be all we could do to overhaul she ""all be well that end well say holmes but certainly do not know that the aurora be such clipper ""smith say she be one of the fast launch on the river and that if he have have another man to help he with the engine we should never have catch she he swear he know nothing of this norwood business ""neither he do cry our prisoner not word choose his launch because hear that she be flier we tell he nothing but we pay he well and he be to get something handsome if we reach our vessel the esmeralda at gravesend outward bind for the brazils ""well if he have do no wrong we shall see that no wrong come to he if we be pretty quick in catch our man we be not so quick in condemn they it be amusing to notice how the consequential jones be already begin to give himself air on the strength of the capture from the slight smile which play over sherlock holmes 's face could see that the speech have not be lose upon he "we will be at vauxhall bridge presently say jones and shall land you dr. watson with the treasure box need hardly tell you that be take very grave responsibility upon myself in do this it be most irregular but of course an agreement be an agreement must however as matter of duty send an inspector with you since you have so valuable charge you will drive no doubt?""yes shall drive ""it be pity there be no key that we may make an inventory first you will have to break it open where be the key my man?""at the bottom of the river say small shortly "hum there be no use your give this unnecessary trouble we have have work enough already through you however doctor need not warn you to be careful bring the box back with you to the baker street room you will find we there on our way to the station "they land i at vauxhall with my heavy iron box and with bluff genial inspector as my companion quarter of an hour 's drive bring we to mrs. cecil forrester 's the servant seem surprised at so late visitor mrs. cecil forrester be out for the evening she explain and likely to be very late miss morstan however be in the drawing room so to the drawing room go box in hand leave the obliging inspector in the cab she be seat by the open window dress in some sort of white diaphanous material with little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist the soft light of shade lamp fall upon she as she lean back in the basket chair play over her sweet grave face and tint with dull metallic sparkle the rich coil of her luxuriant hair one white arm and hand droop over the side of the chair and her whole pose and figure speak of an absorb melancholy at the sound of my foot fall she spring to her foot however and bright flush of surprise and of pleasure color her pale cheek "i hear cab drive up she say think that mrs. forrester have come back very early but never dream that it might be you what news have you bring me?""i have bring something well than news say put down the box upon the table and speak jovially and boisterously though my heart be heavy within i have bring you something which be worth all the news in the world have bring you fortune "she glance at the iron box be that the treasure then she ask coolly enough "yes this be the great agra treasure half of it be yours and half be thaddeus sholto 's you will have couple of hundred thousand each think of that an annuity of ten thousand pound there will be few rich young lady in england be it not glorious?"i think that must have be rather overact my delight and that she detect hollow ring in my congratulation for see her eyebrow rise little and she glance at i curiously "if have it say she owe it to you ""no no answer not to i but to my friend sherlock holmes with all the will in the world could never have follow up clue which have tax even his analytical genius as it be we very nearly lose it at the last moment ""pray sit down and tell i all about it dr. watson say she narrate briefly what have occur since have see she last holmes 's new method of search the discovery of the aurora the appearance of athelney jones our expedition in the evening and the wild chase down the thames she listen with parted lip and shine eye to my recital of our adventure when speak of the dart which have so narrowly miss we she turn so white that fear that she be about to faint "it be nothing she say as hasten to pour she out some water be all right again it be shock to i to hear that have place my friend in such horrible peril ""that be all over answer it be nothing will tell you no more gloomy detail let we turn to something bright there be the treasure what could be bright than that get leave to bring it with i think that it would interest you to be the first to see it ""it would be of the great interest to i she say there be no eagerness in her voice however it have strike she doubtless that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to prize which have cost so much to win "what pretty box she say stoop over it this be indian work suppose?""yes it be benares metal work ""and so heavy she exclaim try to raise it the box alone must be of some value where be the key?""small throw it into the thames answer must borrow mrs. forrester 's poker there be in the front thick and broad hasp work in the image of sit buddha under this thrust the end of the poker and twist it outward as lever the hasp spring open with loud snap with tremble finger fling back the lid we both stand gaze in astonishment the box be empty!no wonder that it be heavy the iron work be two third of an inch thick all round it be massive well make and solid like chest construct to carry thing of great price but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lie within it it be absolutely and completely empty "the treasure be lose say miss morstan calmly as listen to the word and realize what they mean great shadow seem to pass from my soul do not know how this agra treasure have weigh i down until now that it be finally remove it be selfish no doubt disloyal wrong but could realize nothing save that the golden barrier be go from between we thank god ejaculate from my very heart she look at i with quick question smile why do you say that she ask "because you be within my reach again say take her hand she do not withdraw it because love you mary as truly as ever man love woman because this treasure these rich seal my lip now that they be go can tell you how love you that be why say thank god '""then say thank god too she whisper as draw she to my side whoever have lose treasure know that night that have gain one very patient man be that inspector in the cab for it be weary time before rejoin he his face cloud over when show he the empty box "there go the reward say he gloomily where there be no money there be no pay this night 's work would have be worth tenner each to sam brown and i if the treasure have be there ""mr thaddeus sholto be rich man say he will see that you be reward treasure or no "the inspector shake his head despondently however it be bad job he repeat and so mr. athelney jones will think "his forecast prove to be correct for the detective look blank enough when get to baker street and show he the empty box they have only just arrive holmes the prisoner and he for they have change their plan so far as to report themselves at station upon the way my companion lounge in his arm chair with his usual listless expression while small sit stolidly opposite to he with his wooden leg cock over his sound one as exhibit the empty box he lean back in his chair and laugh aloud "this be your do small say athelney jones angrily "yes have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it he cry exultantly it be my treasure and if ca n't have the loot 'll take darned good care that no one else do tell you that no live man have any right to it unless it be three man who be in the andaman convict barracks and myself know now that can not have the use of it and know that they can not have act all through for they as much as for myself it be be the sign of four with we always well know that they would have have i do just what have do and throw the treasure into the thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of sholto or of morstan it be not to make they rich that we do for achmet you 'll find the treasure where the key be and where little tonga be when see that your launch must catch we put the loot away in safe place there be no rupee for you this journey ""you be deceive we small say athelney jones sternly if you have wish to throw the treasure into the thames it would have be easy for you to have throw box and all ""easier for i to throw and easy for you to recover he answer with shrewd sidelong look the man that be clever enough to hunt i down be clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of river now that they be scatter over five mile or so it may be hard job it go to my heart to do it though be half mad when you come up with we however there be no good grieving over it 've have up in my life and 've have down but 've learn not to cry over spill milk ""this be very serious matter small say the detective if you have help justice instead of thwart it in this way you would have had well chance at your trial ""justice snarl the ex convict pretty justice whose loot be this if it be not ours where be the justice that should give it up to those who have never earn it look how have earn it twenty long year in that fever ride swamp all day at work under the mangrove tree all night chain up in the filthy convict hut bite by mosquito rack with ague bully by every cursed black faced policeman who love to take it out of white man that be how earn the agra treasure and you talk to i of justice because can not bear to feel that have pay this price only that another may enjoy it would rather swing score of time or have one of tonga 's dart in my hide than live in convict 's cell and feel that another man be at his ease in palace with the money that should be mine small have drop his mask of stoicism and all this come out in wild whirl of word while his eye blaze and the handcuff clank together with the impassioned movement of his hand could understand as see the fury and the passion of the man that it be no groundless or unnatural terror which have possess major sholto when he first learn that the injure convict be upon his track "you forget that we know nothing of all this say holmes quietly
