know and respect over the country side while be always bit of rover at last however when be about eighteen give they no more trouble for get into mess over girl and could only get out of it again by take the queen 's shilling and join the 3d buffs which be just start for india "i be n't destine to do much soldiering however have just get past the goose step and learn to handle my musket when be fool enough to go swim in the ganges luckily for i my company sergeant john holder be in the water at the same time and he be one of the fine swimmer in the service crocodile take i just as be half way across and nip off my right leg as clean as surgeon could have do it just above the knee what with the shock and the loss of blood faint and should have drown if holder have not catch hold of i and paddle for the bank be five month in hospital over it and when at last be able to limp out of it with this timber toe strap to my stump find myself invalid out of the army and unfit for any active occupation "i be as you can imagine pretty down on my luck at this time for be useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year however my misfortune soon prove to be blessing in disguise man name abelwhite who have come out there as an indigo planter want an overseer to look after his coolie and keep they up to their work he happen to be friend of our colonel 's who have take an interest in i since the accident to make long story short the colonel recommend i strongly for the post and as the work be mostly to be do on horseback my leg be no great obstacle for have enough knee leave to keep good grip on the saddle what have to do be to ride over the plantation to keep an eye on the man as they work and to report the idler the pay be fair have comfortable quarter and altogether be content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo planting mr. abelwhite be kind man and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke pipe with i for white folk out there feel their heart warm to each other as they never do here at home "well be never in luck 's way long suddenly without note of warning the great mutiny break upon we one month india lie as still and peaceful to all appearance as surrey or kent the next there be two hundred thousand black devil let loose and the country be perfect hell of course you know all about it gentleman deal more than do very like since reading be not in my line only know what see with my own eye our plantation be at place call muttra near the border of the northwest provinces night after night the whole sky be alight with the burning bungalow and day after day we have small company of europeans pass through our estate with their wife and child on their way to agra where be the near troop mr. abelwhite be an obstinate man he have it in his head that the affair have be exaggerate and that it would blow over as suddenly as it have spring up there he sit on his veranda drink whiskey peg and smoking cheroot while the country be in blaze about he of course we stick by he and dawson who with his wife use to do the book work and the managing well one fine day the crash come have be away on distant plantation and be ride slowly home in the evening when my eye fall upon something all huddle together at the bottom of steep nullah ride down to see what it be and the cold strike through my heart when find it be dawson 's wife all cut into ribbon and half eat by jackal and native dog little far up the road dawson himself be lie on his face quite dead with an empty revolver in his hand and four sepoys lie across each other in front of he rein up my horse wonder which way should turn but at that moment see thick smoke curl up from abelwhite 's bungalow and the flame begin to burst through the roof know then that could do my employer no good but would only throw my own life away if meddle in the matter from where stand could see hundred of the black fiend with their red coat still on their back dance and howl round the burn house some of they point at i and couple of bullet sing past my head so break away across the paddy field and find myself late at night safe within the wall at agra "as it prove however there be no great safety there either the whole country be up like swarm of bee wherever the english could collect in little band they hold just the ground that their gun command everywhere else they be helpless fugitive it be fight of the million against the hundred and the cruell part of it be that these man that we fight against foot horse and gunner be our own pick troop whom we have teach and train handle our own weapon and blow our own bugle call at agra there be the 3d bengal fusiliers some sikhs two troop of horse and battery of artillery volunteer corps of clerk and merchant have be form and this join wooden leg and all we go out to meet the rebel at shahgunge early in july and we beat they back for time but our powder give out and we have to fall back upon the city nothing but the bad news come to we from every side which be not to be wonder at for if you look at the map you will see that we be right in the heart of it lucknow be rather well than hundred mile to the east and cawnpore about as far to the south from every point on the compass there be nothing but torture and murder and outrage "the city of agra be great place swarm with fanatic and fierce devil worshipper of all sort our handful of man be lose among the narrow winding street our leader move across the river therefore and take up his position in the old fort at agra do n't know if any of you gentleman have ever read or hear anything of that old fort it be very queer place the queer that ever be in and have be in some rum corner too first of all it be enormous in size should think that the enclosure must be acre and acre there be modern part which take all our garrison woman child store and everything else with plenty of room over but the modern part be nothing like the size of the old quarter where nobody go and which be give over to the scorpion and the centipede it be all full of great deserted hall and wind passage and long corridor twist in and out so that it be easy enough for folk to get lose in it for this reason it be seldom that any one go into it though now and again party with torch might go explore "the river wash along the front of the old fort and so protect it but on the side and behind there be many door and these have to be guard of course in the old quarter as well as in that which be actually hold by our troop we be short handed with hardly man enough to man the angle of the building and to serve the gun it be impossible for we therefore to station strong guard at every one of the innumerable gate what we do be to organize central guard house in the middle of the fort and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three native be select to take charge during certain hour of the night of small isolated door upon the southwest side of the building two sikh trooper be place under my command and be instruct if anything go wrong to fire my musket when might rely upon help come at once from the central guard as the guard be good two hundred pace away however and as the space between be cut up into labyrinth of passage and corridor have great doubt as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack "well be pretty proud at have this small command give i since be raw recruit and game legged one at that for two night keep the watch with my punjaubees they be tall fierce look chap mahomet singh and abdullah khan by name both old fighting man who have bear arm against we at chilian wallah they could talk english pretty well but could get little out of they they prefer to stand together and jabber all night in their queer sikh lingo for myself use to stand outside the gate way look down on the broad winding river and on the twinkle light of the great city the beating of drum the rattle of tomtom and the yell and howl of the rebel drunk with opium and with bang be enough to remind we all night of our dangerous neighbor across the stream every two hour the officer of the night use to come round to all the post to make sure that all be well "the third night of my watch be dark and dirty with small drive rain it be dreary work stand in the gate way hour after hour in such weather try again and again to make my sikhs talk but without much success at two in the morning the round pass and break for moment the weariness of the night find that my companion would not be lead into conversation take out my pipe and lay down my musket to strike the match in an instant the two sikhs be upon i one of they snatch my firelock up and level it at my head while the other hold great knife to my throat and swear between his tooth that he would plunge it into i if move step "my first thought be that these fellow be in league with the rebel and that this be the beginning of an assault if our door be in the hand of the sepoys the place must fall and the woman and child be treat as they be in cawnpore maybe you gentleman think that be just make out case for myself but give you my word that when think of that though feel the point of the knife at my throat open my mouth with the intention of give scream if it be my last one which might alarm the main guard the man who hold i seem to know my thought for even as brace myself to it he whisper do n't make noise the fort be safe enough there be no rebel dog on this side of the river there be the ring of truth in what he say and know that if raise my voice be dead man could read it in the fellow 's brown eye wait therefore in silence to see what it be that they want from i "'listen to i sahib say the tall and fiercer of the pair the one whom they call abdullah khan you must either be with we now or you must be silence forever the thing be too great one for we to hesitate either you be heart and soul with we on your oath on the cross of the christians or your body this night shall be throw into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brother in the rebel army there be no middle way which be it to be death or life we can only give you three minute to decide for the time be pass and all must be do before the round come again '"'how can decide say i. you have not tell i what you want of i but tell you now that if it be anything against the safety of the fort will have no truck with it so you can drive home your knife and welcome '"'it be nothing against the fort say he we only ask you to do that which your countryman come to this land for we ask you to be rich if you will be one of we this night we will swear to you upon the naked knife and by the threefold oath which no sikh be ever know to break that you shall have your fair share of the loot quarter of the treasure shall be yours we can say no fair '"'but what be the treasure then ask be as ready to be rich as you can be if you will but show i how it can be do '"'you will swear then say he by the bone of your father by the honor of your mother by the cross of your faith to raise no hand and speak no word against we either now or afterwards?'"'i will swear it answer provide that the fort be not endanger '"'then my comrade and will swear that you shall have quarter of the treasure which shall be equally divide among the four of we '"'there be but three say i."'no dost akbar must have his share we can tell the tale to you while we await they do you stand at the gate mahomet singh and give notice of their come the thing stand thus sahib and tell it to you because know that an oath be bind upon feringhee and that we may trust you have you be lie hindoo though you have swear by all the god in their false temple your blood would have be upon the knife and your body in the water but the sikh know the englishman and the englishman know the sikh hearken then to what have to say "'there be rajah in the northern province who have much wealth though his land be small much have come to he from his father and more still he have set by himself for he be of low nature and hoard his gold rather than spend it when the trouble break out he would be friend both with the lion and the tiger with the sepoy and with the company 's raj soon however it seem to he that the white man 's day be come for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow yet be careful man he make such plan that come what might half at least of his treasure should be leave to he that which be in gold and silver he keep by he in the vault of his palace but the most precious stone and the choice pearl that he have he put in an iron box and send it by trusty servant who under the guise of merchant should take it to the fort at agra there to lie until the land be at peace thus if the rebel win he would have his money but if the company conquer his jewel would be save to he having thus divide his hoard he throw himself into the cause of the sepoys since they be strong upon his border by do this mark you sahib his property become the due of those who have be true to their salt "'this pretended merchant who travel under the name of achmet be now in the city of agra and desire to gain his way into the fort he have with he as travel companion my foster brother dost akbar who know his secret dost akbar have promise this night to lead he to side postern of the fort and have choose this one for his purpose here he will come presently and here he will find mahomet singh and myself await he the place be lonely and none shall know of his coming the world shall know of the merchant achmet no more but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divide among we what say you to it sahib?'"in worcestershire the life of man seem great and sacred thing but it be very different when there be fire and blood all round you and you have be use to meet death at every turn whether achmet the merchant live or die be thing as light as air to i but at the talk about the treasure my heart turn to it and think of what might do in the old country with it and how my folk would stare when they see their ne'er do well come back with his pocket full of gold moidore have therefore already make up my mind abdullah khan however think that hesitate press the matter more closely "'consider sahib say he that if this man be take by the commandant he will be hang or shoot and his jewel take by the government so that no man will be rupee the well for they now since we do the taking of he why should we not do the rest as well the jewel will be as well with we as in the company 's coffer there will be enough to make every one of we rich man and great chief no one can know about the matter for here we be cut off from all man what could be well for the purpose say again then sahib whether you be with we or if we must look upon you as an enemy '"'i be with you heart and soul say i."'it be well he answer hand i back my firelock you see that we trust you for your word like our be not to be break we have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant '"'doe your brother know then of what you will do ask "'the plan be his he have devise it we will go to the gate and share the watch with mahomet singh '"the rain be still fall steadily for it be just the beginning of the wet season brown heavy cloud be drift across the sky and it be hard to see more than stone cast deep moat lie in front of our door but the water be in place nearly dry up and it could easily be cross it be strange to i to be stand there with those two wild punjaubees wait for the man who be come to his death "suddenly my eye catch the glint of shaded lantern at the other side of the moat it vanish among the mound heap and then appear again come slowly in our direction "'here they be exclaim "'you will challenge he sahib as usual whisper abdullah give he no cause for fear send we in with he and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard have the lantern ready to uncover that we may be sure that it be indeed the man '"the light have flicker onwards now stop and now advance until could see two dark figure upon the other side of the moat let they scramble down the slope bank splash through the mire and climb half way up to the gate before challenge they "'who go there say in subdue voice "'friend come the answer uncover my lantern and throw flood of light upon they the first be an enormous sikh with black beard which sweep nearly down to his cummerbund outside of show have never see so tall man the other be little fat round fellow with great yellow turban and bundle in his hand do up in shawl he seem to be all in quiver with fear for his hand twitch as if he have the ague and his head keep turn to left and right with two bright little twinkle eye like mouse when he venture out from his hole it give i the chill to think of kill he but think of the treasure and my heart set as hard as flint within i when he see my white face he give little chirrup of joy and came run up towards i "'your protection sahib he pant your protection for the unhappy merchant achmet have travel across rajpootana that might seek the shelter of the fort at agra have be rob and beat and abuse because have be the friend of the company it be blessed night this when be once more in safety and my poor possession '"'what have you in the bundle ask "'an iron box he answer which contain one or two little family matter which be of no value to other but which should be sorry to lose yet be not beggar and shall reward you young sahib and your governor also if he will give i the shelter ask '"i could not trust myself to speak long with the man the more look at his fat frightened face the hard do it seem that we should slay he in cold blood it be good to get it over "'take he to the main guard say i. the two sikhs close in upon he on each side and the giant walk behind while they march in through the dark gate way never be man so compassed round with death remain at the gate way with the lantern "i could hear the measured tramp of their footstep sound through the lonely corridor suddenly it cease and hear voice and scuffle with the sound of blow moment later there come to my horror rush of footstep come in my direction with the loud breathing of run man turn my lantern down the long straight passage and there be the fat man run like the wind with smear of blood across his face and close at his heel bound like tiger the great black bearded sikh with knife flash in his hand have never see man run so fast as that little merchant he be gain on the sikh and could see that if he once pass i and get to the open air he would save himself yet my heart soften to he but again the thought of his treasure turn i hard and bitter cast my firelock between his leg as he race past and he roll twice over like shot rabbit ere he could stagger to his foot the sikh be upon he and bury his knife twice in his side the man never utter moan nor move muscle but lay be he have fall think myself that he may have break his neck with the fall you see gentleman that be keep my promise be tell you every work of the business just exactly as it happen whether it be in my favor or not "he stop and hold out his manacled hand for the whiskey and water which holmes have brew for he for myself confess that have now conceive the utmost horror of the man not only for this cold blooded business in which he have be concern but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrate it whatever punishment be in store for he feel that he
