might expect no sympathy from i sherlock holmes and jones sit with their hand upon their knee deeply interested in the story but with the same disgust write upon their face he may have observe it for there be touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceed "it be all very bad no doubt say he should like to know how many fellow in my shoe would have refuse share of this loot when they know that they would have their throat cut for their pain besides it be my life or his when once he be in the fort if he have get out the whole business would come to light and should have be court martialle and shoot as likely as not for people be not very lenient at time like that ""go on with your story say holmes shortly "well we carry he in abdullah akbar and i. fine weight he be too for all that he be so short mahomet singh be leave to guard the door we take he to place which the sikhs have already prepare it be some distance off where winding passage lead to great empty hall the brick wall of which be all crumble to piece the earth floor have sink in at one place make natural grave so we leave achmet the merchant there having first cover he over with loose brick this do we all go back to the treasure "it lay where he have drop it when he be first attack the box be the same which now lie open upon your table key be hang by silken cord to that carve handle upon the top we open it and the light of the lantern gleam upon collection of gem such as have read of and think about when be little lad at pershore it be blind to look upon they when we have feast our eye we take they all out and make list of they there be one hundred and forty three diamond of the first water include one which have be call believe the great mogul and be say to be the second large stone in existence then there be ninety seven very fine emerald and one hundred and seventy ruby some of which however be small there be forty carbuncle two hundred and ten sapphire sixty one agate and great quantity of beryls onyx cats'-eyes turquoise and other stone the very name of which do not know at the time though have become more familiar with they since besides this there be nearly three hundred very fine pearl twelve of which be set in gold coronet by the way these last have be take out of the chest and be not there when recover it "after we have count our treasure we put they back into the chest and carry they to the gate way to show they to mahomet singh then we solemnly renew our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret we agree to conceal our loot in safe place until the country should be at peace again and then to divide it equally among ourselves there be no use divide it at present for if gem of such value be find upon we it would cause suspicion and there be no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep they we carry the box therefore into the same hall where we have bury the body and there under certain brick in the well preserve wall we make hollow and put our treasure we make careful note of the place and next day draw four plan one for each of we and put the sign of the four of we at the bottom for we have swear that we should each always act for all so that none might take advantage that be an oath that can put my hand to my heart and swear that have never break "well there be no use my tell you gentleman what come of the indian mutiny after wilson take delhi and sir colin relieve lucknow the back of the business be break fresh troop came pour in and nana sahib make himself scarce over the frontier fly column under colonel greathed come round to agra and clear the pandies away from it peace seem to be settle upon the country and we four be begin to hope that the time be at hand when we might safely go off with our share of the plunder in moment however our hope be shatter by our be arrest as the murderer of achmet "it come about in this way when the rajah put his jewel into the hand of achmet he do it because he know that he be trusty man they be suspicious folk in the east however so what do this rajah do but take second even more trusty servant and set he to play the spy upon the first this second man be order never to let achmet out of his sight and he follow he like his shadow he go after he that night and see he pass through the doorway of course he think he have take refuge in the fort and apply for admission there himself next day but could find no trace of achmet this seem to he so strange that he speak about it to sergeant of guide who bring it to the ear of the commandant thorough search be quickly make and the body be discover thus at the very moment that we think that all be safe we be all four seize and bring to trial on charge of murder three of we because we have hold the gate that night and the fourth because he be know to have be in the company of the murder man not word about the jewel come out at the trial for the rajah have be depose and drive out of india so no one have any particular interest in they the murder however be clearly make out and it be certain that we must all have be concern in it the three sikhs get penal servitude for life and be condemn to death though my sentence be afterwards commute into the same as the other "it be rather queer position that we find ourselves in then there we be all four tie by the leg and with precious little chance of ever get out again while we each hold secret which might have put each of we in palace if we could only have make use of it it be enough to make man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack in office to have rice to eat and water to drink when that gorgeous fortune be ready for he outside just wait to be pick up it might have drive i mad but be always pretty stubborn one so just hold on and bide my time "at last it seem to i to have come be change from agra to madras and from there to blair island in the andamans there be very few white convict at this settlement and as have behave well from the first soon find myself sort of privileged person be give hut in hope town which be small place on the slope of mount harriet and be leave pretty much to myself it be dreary fever stricken place and all beyond our little clearing be infest with wild cannibal native who be ready enough to blow poisoned dart at we if they see chance there be dig and ditching and yam planting and dozen other thing to be do so we be busy enough all day though in the evening we have little time to ourselves among other thing learn to dispense drug for the surgeon and pick up smattering of his knowledge all the time be on the lookout for chance of escape but it be hundred of mile from any other land and there be little or no wind in those sea so it be terribly difficult job to get away "the surgeon dr. somerton be fast sport young chap and the other young officer would meet in his room of an evening and play card the surgery where use to make up my drug be next to his sitting room with small window between we often if feel lonesome use to turn out the lamp in the surgery and then stand there could hear their talk and watch their play be fond of hand at card myself and it be almost as good as have one to watch the other there be major sholto captain morstan and lieutenant bromley brown who be in command of the native troop and there be the surgeon himself and two or three prison official crafty old hand who play nice sly safe game very snug little party they use to make "well there be one thing which very soon strike i and that be that the soldier use always to lose and the civilian to win mind do n't say that there be anything unfair but so it be these prison chap have do little else than play card ever since they have be at the andamans and they know each other 's game to point while the other just play to pass the time and throw their card down anyhow night after night the soldier get up poor man and the poor they get the more keen they be to play major sholto be the hard hit he use to pay in note and gold at first but soon it come to note of hand and for big sum he sometimes would win for few deal just to give he heart and then the luck would set in against he bad than ever all day he would wander about as black as thunder and he take to drink deal more than be good for he "one night he lose even more heavily than usual be sit in my hut when he and captain morstan came stumble along on the way to their quarter they be bosom friend those two and never far apart the major be rave about his loss "'it be all up morstan he be say as they pass my hut shall have to send in my paper be ruin man '"'nonsense old chap say the other slap he upon the shoulder 've have nasty facer myself but that be all could hear but it be enough to set i think "a couple of day later major sholto be stroll on the beach so take the chance of speak to he "'i wish to have your advice major say i."'well small what be it he ask take his cheroot from his lip "'i want to ask you sir say who be the proper person to whom hide treasure should be hand over know where half million worth lie and as can not use it myself think perhaps the good thing that could do would be to hand it over to the proper authority and then perhaps they would get my sentence shorten for i '"'half million small he gasp look hard at i to see if be in earnest "'quite that sir in jewel and pearl it lie there ready for any one and the queer thing about it be that the real owner be outlaw and can not hold property so that it belong to the first comer '"'to government small he stammer to government but he say it in halting fashion and know in my heart that have get he "'you think then sir that should give the information to the governor general say quietly "'well well you must not do anything rash or that you might repent let i hear all about it small give i the fact '"i tell he the whole story with small change so that he could not identify the place when have finish he stand stock still and full of thought could see by the twitch of his lip that there be struggle go on within he "'this be very important matter small he say at last you must not say word to any one about it and shall see you again soon '"two night later he and his friend captain morstan come to my hut in the dead of the night with lantern "'i want you just to let captain morstan hear that story from your own lip small say he "i repeat it as have tell it before "'it ring true eh say he it be good enough to act upon?'"captain morstan nod "'look here small say the major we have be talk it over my friend here and and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours be hardly government matter after all but be private concern of your own which of course you have the power of dispose of as you think good now the question be what price would you ask for it we might be inclined to take it up and at least look into it if we could agree as to term he try to speak in cool careless way but his eye be shine with excitement and greed "'why as to that gentleman answer try also to be cool but feel as excited as he do there be only one bargain which man in my position can make shall want you to help i to my freedom and to help my three companion to theirs we shall then take you into partnership and give you fifth share to divide between you '"'hum say he fifth share that be not very tempting '"'it would come to fifty thousand apiece say i."'but how can we gain your freedom you know very well that you ask an impossibility '"'nothe of the sort answer have think it all out to the last detail the only bar to our escape be that we can get no boat fit for the voyage and no provision to last we for so long time there be plenty of little yacht and yawl at calcutta or madras which would serve our turn well do you bring one over we shall engage to get aboard she by night and if you will drop we on any part of the indian coast you will have do your part of the bargain '"'if there be only one he say "'none or all answer we have swear it the four of we must always act together '"'you see morstan say he small be man of his word he do not flinch from his friend think we may very well trust he '"'it be dirty business the other answer yet as you say the money would save our commission handsomely '"'well small say the major we must suppose try and meet you we must first of course test the truth of your story tell i where the box be hide and shall get leave of absence and go back to india in the monthly relief boat to inquire into the affair '"'not so fast say grow cold as he get hot must have the consent of my three comrade tell you that it be four or none with we '"'nonsense he break in what have three black fellow to do with our agreement?'"'black or blue say they be in with i and we all go together '"well the matter end by second meeting at which mahomet singh abdullah khan and dost akbar be all present we talk the matter over again and at last we come to an arrangement we be to provide both the officer with chart of the part of the agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure be hide major sholto be to go to india to test our story if he find the box he be to leave it there to send out small yacht provision for voyage which be to lie off rutland island and to which we be to make our way and finally to return to his duty captain morstan be then to apply for leave of absence to meet we at agra and there we be to have final division of the treasure he take the major 's share as well as his own all this we seal by the most solemn oath that the mind could think or the lip utter sit up all night with paper and ink and by the morning have the two chart all ready sign with the sign of four that is of abdullah akbar mahomet and myself "well gentleman weary you with my long story and know that my friend mr. jones be impatient to get i safely stow in chokey 'll make it as short as can the villain sholto go off to india but he never come back again captain morstan show i his name among list of passenger in one of the mail boat very shortly afterwards his uncle have die leave he fortune and he have leave the army yet he could stoop to treat five man as he have treat we morstan go over to agra shortly afterwards and find as we expect that the treasure be indeed go the scoundrel have steal it all without carry out one of the condition on which we have sell he the secret from that day live only for vengeance think of it by day and nurse it by night it become an overpowering absorb passion with i care nothing for the law nothing for the gallow to escape to track down sholto to have my hand upon his throat that be my one thought even the agra treasure have come to be small thing in my mind than the slaying of sholto "well have set my mind on many thing in this life and never one which do not carry out but it be weary year before my time come have tell you that have pick up something of medicine one day when dr. somerton be down with fever little andaman islander be pick up by convict gang in the wood he be sick to death and have go to lonely place to die take he in hand though he be as venomous as young snake and after couple of month get he all right and able to walk he take kind of fancy to i then and would hardly go back to his wood but be always hang about my hut learn little of his lingo from he and this make he all the fonder of i "tonga for that be his name be fine boatman and own big roomy canoe of his own when find that he be devoted to i and would do anything to serve i see my chance of escape talk it over with he he be to bring his boat round on certain night to an old wharf which be never guard and there he be to pick i up give he direction to have several gourd of water and lot of yam cocoa nut and sweet potato "he be stanch and true be little tonga no man ever have more faithful mate at the night name he have his boat at the wharf as it chance however there be one of the convict guard down there vile pathan who have never miss chance of insult and injure i have always vow vengeance and now have my chance it be as if fate have place he in my way that might pay my debt before leave the island he stand on the bank with his back to i and his carbine on his shoulder look about for stone to beat out his brain with but none could see then queer thought come into my head and show i where could lay my hand on weapon sit down in the darkness and unstrappe my wooden leg with three long hop be on he he put his carbine to his shoulder but strike he full and knock the whole front of his skull in you can see the split in the wood now where hit he we both go down together for could not keep my balance but when get up find he still lie quiet enough make for the boat and in an hour we be well out at sea tonga have bring all his earthly possession with he his arm and his god among other thing he have long bamboo spear and some andaman cocoa nut matting with which make sort of sail for ten day we be beat about trust to luck and on the eleventh we be pick up by trader which be go from singapore to jiddah with cargo of malay pilgrim they be rum crowd and tonga and soon manage to settle down among they they have one very good quality they let you alone and ask no question "well if be to tell you all the adventure that my little chum and go through you would not thank i for would have you here until the sun be shine here and there we drift about the world something always turn up to keep we from london all the time however never lose sight of my purpose would dream of sholto at night hundred time have kill he in my sleep at last however some three or four year ago we find ourselves in england have no great difficulty in find where sholto live and set to work to discover whether he have realize the treasure or if he still have it make friend with someone who could help i name no name for do n't want to get any one else in hole and soon find that he still have the jewel then try to get at he in many way but he be pretty sly and have always two prize fighter besides his son and his khitmutgar on guard over he "one day however get word that he be die hurry at once to the garden mad that he should slip out of my clutch like that and look through the window see he lie in his bed with his son on each side of he 'd have come through and take my chance with the three of they only even as look at he his jaw drop and know that he be go get into his room that same night though and search his paper to see if there be any record of where he have hide our jewel there be not line however so come away bitter and savage as man could be before leave bethought i that if ever meet my sikh friend again it would be satisfaction to know that have leave some mark of our hatred so scrawl down the sign of the four of we as it have be on the chart and pin it on his bosom it be too much that he should be take to the grave without some token from the man whom he have rob and befool "we earn living at this time by my exhibit poor tonga at fair and other such place as the black cannibal he would eat raw meat and dance his war dance so we always have hatful of penny after day 's work still hear all the news from pondicherry lodge and for some year there be no news to hear except that they be hunt for the treasure at last however come what we have wait for so long the treasure have be find it be up at the top of the house in mr. bartholomew sholto 's chemical laboratory come at once and have look at the place but could not see how with my wooden leg be to make my way up to it learn however about trap door in the roof and also about mr. sholto 's supper hour it seem to i that could manage the thing easily through tonga bring he out with i with long rope wind round his waist he could climb like cat and he soon make his way through the roof but as ill luck would have it bartholomew sholto be still in the room to his cost tonga think he have do something very clever in kill
