be set apart for he and stand silent and erect with his hand upon the gold bell which be use in the private orison of the abbot 's own household his dark eye glance rapidly over the assembly and finally settle with grim and menacing twinkle upon the face of his accuser the chancellor rise and having slowly unroll the parchment scroll proceed to read it out in thick and pompous voice while subdue rustle and movement among the brother bespoke the interest with which they follow the proceeding "charge bring upon the second thursday after the feast of the assumption in the year of our lord

master of the novice that he should restrict his food for two day to single three pound loaf of bran and bean for the great honoring and glorifying of st. monica mother of the holy augustine he be hear by brother ambrose and other to say that he wish twenty thousand devil would fly away with the say monica mother of the holy augustine or any other saint who come between man and his meat item that upon brother ambrose reprove he for this blasphemous wish he do hold the said brother face downward over the piscatorium or fish pond for space during which the say brother be able to repeat pater and four ave for the well fortifying of his soul against impend death "there be buzz and murmur among the white frocked brother at this grave charge but the abbot hold up his long quiver hand what then say he "item that between none and vesper on the feast of james the less the say brother john be observe upon the brockenhurst road near the spot which be know as hatchett 's pond in converse with person of the other sex be maiden of the name of mary sowley the daughter of the king 's verderer item that after sundry jape and joke the said brother john do lift up the say mary sowley and do take carry and convey she across stream to the infinite relish of the devil and the exceed detriment of his own soul which scandalous and wilful fall away be witness by three member of our order "a dead silence throughout the room with rolling of head and upturning of eye bespoke the pious horror of the community the abbot draw his gray brow low over his fiercely question eye "who can vouch for this thing he ask "that can answer the accuser so too can brother porphyry who be with i and brother mark of the spicarium who hath be so much stir and inwardly trouble by the sight that he now lie in fever through it ""and the woman ask the abbot do she not break into lamentation and woe that brother should so demean himself?""nay she smile sweetly upon he and thank he can vouch it and so can brother porphyry ""canst thou cry the abbot in high tempestuous tone canst thou so hast forget that the five and thirtieth rule of the order be that in the presence of woman the face should be ever avert and the eye cast down hast forget it say if your eye be upon your sandal how came ye to see this smile of which ye prate week in your cell false brother week of rye bread and lentil with double laud and double matin may help ye to remembrance of the law under which ye live "at this sudden outflame of wrath the two witness sink their face on to their chest and sit as man crush the abbot turn his angry eye away from they and bend they upon the accuse who meet his search gaze with firm and composed face "what hast thou to say brother john upon these weighty thing which be urge against you?""little enough good father little enough say the novice speak english with broad west saxon drawl the brother who be english to man prick up their ear at the sound of the homely and yet unfamiliar speech but the abbot flush red with anger and strike his hand upon the oaken arm of his chair "what talk be this he cry be this tongue to be use within the wall of an old and well famed monastery but grace and learning have ever go hand in hand and when one be lose it be needless to look for the other ""i know not about that say brother john know only that the word come kindly to my mouth for it be the speech of my father before i under your favor shall either use it now or hold my peace "the abbot pat his foot and nod his head as one who pass point but do not forget it "for the matter of the ale continue brother john have come in hot from the field and have scarce get the taste of the thing before mine eye light upon the bottom of the pot it may be too that speak somewhat shortly concern the bran and the bean the same be poor provender and unfit for man of my inch it be true also that do lay my hand upon this jack fool of brother ambrose though as you can see do he little scathe as regard the maid too it be true that do heft she over the stream she have on her hosen and shoon whilst have but my wooden sandal which could take no hurt from the water should have think shame upon my manhood as well as my monkhood if have hold back my hand from she he glance around as he speak with the half amused look which he have wear during the whole proceeding "there be no need to go far say the abbot he have confess to all it only remain for i to portion out the punishment which be due to his evil conduct "he rise and the two long line of brother follow his example look sideways with scared face at the angry prelate "john of hordle he thunder you have show yourself during the two month of your novitiate to be recreant monk and one who be unworthy to wear the white garb which be the outer symbol of the spotless spirit that dress shall therefore be strip from thee and thou shalt be cast into the outer world without benefit of clerkship and without lot or part in the grace and blessing of those who dwell under the care of the blessed benedict thou shalt come back neither to beaulieu nor to any of the grange of beaulieu and thy name shall be strike off the scroll of the order "the sentence appear terrible one to the old monk who have become so used to the safe and regular life of the abbey that they would have be as helpless as child in the outer world from their pious oasis they look dreamily out at the desert of life place full of storming and striving comfortless restless and overshadow by evil the young novice however appear to have other thought for his eye sparkle and his smile broaden it need but that to add fresh fuel to the fiery mood of the prelate "so much for thy spiritual punishment he cry but it be to thy gross feeling that we must turn in such nature as thine and as thou art no long under the shield of holy church there be the less difficulty ho there lay brother francis naomi joseph seize he and bind his arm drag he forth and let the forester and the porter scourge he from the precincts!"as these three brother advanced towards he to carry out the abbot 's direction the smile fade from the novice 's face and he glance right and leave with his fierce brown eye like bull at baiting then with sudden deep cheste shout he tear up the heavy oaken prie dieu and poise it to strike take two step backward the while that none might take he at vantage "by the black rood of waltham he roar if any knave among you lay finger end upon the edge of my gown will crush his skull like filbert with his thick knotted arm his thunder voice and his bristle of red hair there be something so repellent in the man that the three brother fly back at the very glare of he and the two row of white monk strain away from he like poplar in temp the abbot only spring forward with shine eye but the chancellor and the master hang upon either arm and wrest he back out of danger 's way "he be possess of devil they shout run brother ambrose brother joachim call hugh of the mill and woodman wat and raoul with his arbal and bolt tell they that we be in fear of our life run run for the love of the virgin!"but the novice be strategist as well as man of action spring forward he hurl his unwieldy weapon at brother ambrose and as desk and monk clatter on to the floor together he spring through the open door and down the wind stair sleepy old brother athanasius at the porter 's cell have fleeting vision of twinkle foot and fly skirt but before he have time to rub his eye the recreant have pass the lodge and be speed as fast as his sandal could patter along the lyndhurst road never have the peaceful atmosphere of the old cistercian house be so rudely ruffle never have there be insurrection so sudden so short and so successful yet the abbot berghersh be man of too firm grain to allow one bold outbreak to imperil the settle order of his great household in few hot and bitter word he compare their false brother 's exit to the expulsion of our first parent from the garden and more than hint that unless reformation occur some other of the community might find themselves in the same evil and perilous case having thus point the moral and reduce his flock to fitting state of docility he dismiss they once more to their labor and withdraw himself to his own private chamber there to seek spiritual aid in the discharge of the duty of his high office the abbot be still on his knee when gentle tap at the door of his cell break in upon his orison rise in no very good humor at the interruption he give the word to enter but his look of impatience soften down into pleasant and paternal smile as his eye fall upon his visitor he be thin faced yellow haired youth rather above the middle size comely and well shapen with straight lithe figure and eager boyish feature his clear pensive gray eye and quick delicate expression speak of nature which have unfold far from the boisterous joy and sorrow of the world yet there be set of the mouth and prominence of the chin which relieve he of any trace of effeminacy impulsive he might be enthusiastic sensitive with something sympathetic and adaptive in his disposition but an observer of nature 's token would have confidently pledge himself that there be native firmness and strength underlie his gentle monk breed way the youth be not clothe in monastic garb but in lay attire though his jerkin cloak and hose be all of sombre hue as befit one who dwell in sacred precinct broad leather strap hang from his shoulder support scrip or satchel such as traveller be wo nt to carry in one hand he grasp thick staff point and shod with metal while in the other he hold his coif or bonnet which bear in its front broad pewter medal stamp with the image of our lady of rocamadour "art ready then fair son say the abbot this be indeed day of coming and of going it be strange that in one twelve hour the abbey should have cast off its foul weed and should now lose what we be fain to look upon as our choice blossom ""you speak too kindly father the youth answer if have my will should never go forth but should end my day here in beaulieu it hath be my home as far back as my mind can carry i and it be sore thing for i to have to leave it ""life bring many cross say the abbot gently who be without they your go forth be grief to we as well as to yourself but there be no help have give my foreword and sacred promise to your father edric the franklin that at the age of twenty you should be send out into the world to see for yourself how you like the savor of it seat thee upon the settle alleyne for you may need rest ere long "the youth sit down as direct but reluctantly and with diffidence the abbot stand by the narrow window and his long black shadow fall slantwise across the rush strew floor "twenty year ago he say your father the franklin of minstead die leave to the abbey three hide of rich land in the hundred of malwood and leave to we also his infant son on condition that we should rear he until he come to man 's estate this he do partly because your mother be dead and partly because your eld brother now socman of minstead have already give sign of that fierce and rude nature which would make he no fit companion for you it be his desire and request however that you should not remain in the cloister but should at ripe age return into the world ""but father interrupt the young man it be surely true that be already advanced several degree in clerkship?""yes fair son but not so far as to bar you from the garb
