for have they from that pious christian and valiant knight sir john de mandeville who stop twice at beaulieu on his way to and from southampton and discourse to we concern what he have see from the reader 's desk in the refectory until there be many good brother who get neither bit nor sup so stricken be they by his strange tale ""i would fain know father ask the young man what there may be at the end of the world?""there be some thing reply the abbot gravely into which it be never intend that we should inquire but you have long road before you whither will you first turn?""to my brother 's at minstead if he be indeed an ungodly and violent man there be the more need that should seek he out and see whether can not turn he to well way "the abbot shake his head the socman of minstead hath earn an evil name over the country side he say if you must go to he see at least that he doth not turn you from the narrow path upon which you have learn to tread but you be in god 's keeping and godward should you ever look in danger and in trouble above all shun the snare of woman for they be ever set for the foolish foot of the young kneel down my child and take an old man 's blessing "alleyne edricson bend his head while the abbot pour out his heartfelt supplication that heaven would watch over this young soul now go forth into the darkness and danger of the world it be no mere form for either of they to they the outside life of mankind do indeed seem to be one of violence and of sin beset with physical and still more with spiritual danger heaven too be very near to they in those day god 's direct agency be to be see in the thunder and the rainbow the whirlwind and the lightning to the believer cloud of angel and confessor and martyr army of the sainted and the saved be ever stoop over their struggle brother upon earth raise encouraging and support they it be then with light heart and stouter courage that the young man turn from the abbot 's room while the latter follow he to the stair head finally commend he to the protection of the holy julian patron of traveller underneath in the porch of the abbey the monk have gather to give he last god speed many have bring some parting token by which he should remember they there be brother bartholomew with crucifix of rare carve ivory and brother luke with white back psalter adorn with golden bee and brother francis with the slay of the innocents most daintily set forth upon vellum all these be duly pack away deep in the traveller 's scrip and above they old pippin face brother athanasius have place parcel of simnel bread and rammel cheese with small flask of the famous blue seal abbey wine so amid hand shaking and laughing and blessing alleyne edricson turn his back upon beaulieu at the turn of the road he stop and gaze back there be the wide spread building which he know so well the abbot 's house the long church the cloister with their line of arch all bathe and mellow in the evening sun there too be the broad sweep of the river exe the old stone well the canopied niche of the virgin and in the centre of all the cluster of white robe figure who wave their hand to he sudden mist swam up before the young man 's eye and he turn away upon his journey with heavy heart and choke throat it be not however in the nature of thing that lad of twenty with young life glow in his vein and all the wide world before he should spend his first hour of freedom in mourning for what he have leave long ere alleyne be out of sound of the beaulieu bell he be stride sturdily along swinge his staff and whistle as merrily as the bird in the thicket it be an evening to raise man 's heart the sun shine slantwise through the tree throw delicate tracery across the road with bar of golden light between away in the distance before and behind the green bough now turn in place to coppery redness shoot their broad arch across the track the still summer air be heavy with the resinous smell of the great forest here and there tawny brook prattle out from among the underwood and lose itself again in the fern and bramble upon the further side save the dull piping of insect and the sough of the leave there be silence everywhere the sweet restful silence of nature and yet there be no want of life the whole wide wood be full of it now it be lithe furtive stoat which shoot across the path upon some fell errand of its own then it be wild cat which squat upon the outlying branch of an oak and peep at the traveller with yellow and dubious eye once it be wild sow which scuttle out of the bracken with two young sounder at her heel and once lordly red staggard walk daintily out from among the tree trunk and look around he with the fearless gaze of one who live under the king 's own high protection alleyne give his staff merry flourish however and the red deer bethink he that the king be far off so streak away from whence he come the youth have now journey considerably beyond the furth domain of the abbey he be the more surprised therefore when on come round turn in the path he perceive man clothe in the familiar garb of the order and seat in clump of heather by the roadside alleyne have know every brother well but this be face which be new to he face which be very red and puff work this way and that as though the man be sore perplexed in his mind once he shake both hand furiously in the air and twice he spring from his seat and hurry down the road when he rise however alleyne observe that his robe be much too long and loose for he in every direction trail upon the ground and bag about his ankle so that even with truss up skirt he could make little progress he run once but the long gown clog he so that he slow down into shambling walk and finally plump into the heather once more "young friend say he when alleyne be abreast of he fear from thy garb that thou canst know little of the abbey of beaulieu ""then you be in error friend the clerk answer for have spend all my day within its wall ""hast so indeed cry he then perhaps canst tell i the name of great loathly lump of brother wi freckle face an hand like spade his eye be black an his hair be red an his voice like the parish bull trow that there can not be two alike in the same cloister ""that surely can be no other than brother john say alleyne trust he have do you no wrong that you should be so hot against he ""wrong quotha cry the other jump out of the heather wrong why he hath steal every plack of clothing off my back if that be wrong and hath leave i here in this sorry frock of white falding so that have shame to go back to my wife lest she think that have don her old kirtle harrow and alas that ever should have meet him!""but how come this ask the young clerk who could scarce keep from laughter at the sight of the hot little man so swathe in the great white cloak "it come in this way he say sit down once more be pass this way hope to reach lymington ere nightfall when come on this red headed knave seat even where we be sit now uncover and loute as pass think that he might be holy man at his orison but he call to i and ask i if have hear speak of the new indulgence in favor of the cistercians not answer then the bad for thy soul say he and with that he break into long tale how that on account of the virtue of the abbot berghersh it have be decree by the pope that whoever should wear the habit of monk of beaulieu for as long as he might say the seven psalm of david should be assure of the kingdom of heaven when hear this pray he on my knee that he would give i the use of his gown which after many contention he at last agree to do on my pay he three mark towards the regilding of the image of laurence the martyr having strip his robe have no choice but to let he have the wearing of my good leathern jerkin and hose for as he say it be chill to the blood and unseemly to the eye to stand frockless whilst make my orison he have scarce get they on and it be sore labor see that my inch will scarce match my girth he have scarce get they on say and not yet at the end of the second psalm when he bid i do honor to my new dress and with that set off down the road as fast as foot would carry he for myself could no more run than if have be sow in sack so here sit and here be like to sit before set eye upon my clothe again ""nay friend take it not so sadly say alleyne clap the disconsolate one upon the shoulder canst change thy robe for jerkin once more at the abbey unless perchance you have friend near at hand ""that have he answer and close but care not to go nigh he in this plight for his wife hath gibing tongue and will spread the tale until could not show my face in any market from fordingbridge to southampton but if you fair sir out of your kind charity would be pleased to go matter of two bow shot out of your way you would do i such service as could scarce repay ""with all my heart say alleyne readily "then take this pathway on the left pray thee and then the deer track which pass on the right you will then see under great beech tree the hut of charcoal burner give he my name good sir the name of peter the full of lymington and ask he for change of raiment that may pursue my journey without delay there be reason why he would be loth to refuse i "alleyne start off along the path indicate and soon find the log hut where the burner dwell he be away faggot cutting in the forest but his wife ruddy bustling dame find the needful garment and tie they into bundle while she busy herself in find and fold they alleyne edricson stand by the open door look in at she with much interest and some distrust for he have never be so nigh to woman before she have round red arm dress of some sober woollen stuff and brass brooch the size of cheese cake stick in the front of it "peter the full she keep repeat marry come up if be peter the fuller 's wife would teach he well than to give his clothe to the first knave who ask for they but he be always poor fond silly creature be peter though we be beholden to he for help to bury our second son wat who be prentice to he at lymington in the year of the black death but who be you young sir?""i be clerk on my road from beaulieu to minstead ""aye indeed hast be bring up at the abbey then could read it from thy reddened cheek and downcast eye hast learn from the monk trow to fear woman as thou wouldst lazar house out upon they that they should dishonor their own mother by such teaching pretty world it would be with all the woman out of it ""heaven forfend that such thing should come to pass say alleyne "aman and amen but thou art pretty lad and the prettier for thy modest way it be easy to see from thy cheek that thou hast not spend thy day in the rain and the heat and the wind as my poor wat hath be force to do ""i have indeed see little of life good dame ""wilt find nothing in it to pay for the loss of thy own freshness here be the clothe and peter can leave they when next he come this way holy virgin see the dust upon thy doublet it be easy to see that there be no woman to tend to thee so that be well now buss i boy "alleyne stoop and kiss she for the kiss be the common salutation of the age and as erasmus long afterwards remark more use in england than in any other country yet it send the blood to his temple again and he wonder as he turn away what the abbot berghersh would have answer to so frank an invitation he be still tingle from this new experience when he come out upon the high road and see sight which drive all other thought from his mind some way down from where he have leave he the unfortunate peter be stamp and rave tenfold bad than before now however instead of the great white cloak he have no clothe on at all save short woollen shirt and pair of leather shoe far down the road long legged figure be run with bundle under one arm and the other hand to his side like man who laugh until he be sore "see he yell peter look to he you shall be my witness he shall see winchester jail for this see where he go with my cloak under his arm!""who then cry alleyne "who but that curse brother john he hath not leave i clothe enough to make gallybagger the double thief hath cozen i out of my gown ""stay though my friend it be his gown object alleyne "it boot not he hath they all gown jerkin hosen and all gramercy to he that he leave i the shirt and the shoon doubt not that he will be back for they anon ""but how come this ask alleyne open eyed with astonishment "are those the clothe for dear charity 's sake give they to i not the pope himself shall have these from i though he send the whole college of cardinal to ask it how come it why you have scarce go ere this loathly john came run back again and when ope mouth to reproach he he ask i whether it be indeed likely that man of prayer would leave his own godly raiment in order to take layman 's jerkin he have he say but go for while that might be the free for my devotion on this pluck off the gown and he with much show of haste do begin to undo his point but when throw his frock down he clip it up and run off all untrussed leave i in this sorry plight he laugh so the while like great croaking frog that might have catch he have my breath not be as short as his leg be long "the young man listen to this tale of wrong with all the seriousness that he could maintain but at the sight of the pursy red face man and the dignity with which he bear he the laughter come so thick upon he that he have to lean up against tree trunk the fuller look sadly and gravely at he but find that he still laugh he bow with much mock politeness and stalk onwards in his borrow clothe alleyne watch he until he be small in the distance and then wipe the tear from his eye he set off briskly once more upon his journey the road along which he travel be scarce as populous as most other road in the kingdom and far less so than those which lie between the large town yet from time to time alleyne meet other wayfarer and more than once be overtake by string of pack mule and horseman journey in the same direction as himself once beg friar came limp along in brown habit implore in most dolorous voice to give he single groat to buy bread wherewith to save himself from impend death alleyne pass he swiftly by for he have learn from the monk to have no love for the wandering friar and besides there be great half gnaw mutton bone stick out of his pouch to prove he liar swiftly as he go however he could not escape the curse of the four bless evangelist which the mendicant howl behind he so dreadful be his execration that the frightened lad thrust his finger into his ear hole and run until the fellow be but brown smirch upon the yellow road far on at the edge of the woodland he come upon chapman and his wife who sit upon fallen tree he have put his pack down as table and the two of they be devour great pasty and wash it down with some drink from stone jar the chapman break rough jest as he pass and the woman call shrilly to alleyne to come and join they on which the man turn suddenly from mirth to wrath begin to belabor she with his cudgel alleyne hasten on lest he make more mischief and his heart be heavy as lead within he look where he would he seem to see nothing but injustice and violence and the hardness of man to man but even as he brood sadly over it and pine for the sweet peace of the abbey he come on an open space dot with holly bush where be the strange sight that he have yet chance upon near to the pathway lie long clump of greenery and from behind this there stick straight up into the air four human leg clothe in parti colored hosen yellow and black strange of all be when brisk tune strike suddenly up and the four leg begin to kick and twitter in time to the music walk on tiptoe round the bush he stand in amazement to see two man bound about on their head while they play the one viol and the other pipe as merrily and as truly as though they be seat in choir alleyne cross himself as he gaze at this unnatural sight and could scarce hold his ground with steady face when the two dancer catch sight of he come bounce in his direction spear 's length from he they each throw somersault into the air and come down upon their foot with smirk face and their hand over their heart "a guerdon guerdon my knight of the stare eye cry one "a gift my prince shout the other any trifle will serve purse of gold or even jewel goblet "alleyne think of what he have read of demoniac possession the jumping the twitching the wild talk it be in his mind to repeat over the exorcism proper to such attack but the two burst out laugh at his scared face and turn on to their head once more clap their heel in derision "hast never see tumbler before ask the elder black browed swarthy man as brown and supple as hazel twig why shrink from we then as though we be the spawn of the evil one?""why shrink my honey bird why so afeard my sweet cinnamon exclaim the other loose jointed lanky youth with dancing roguish eye "truly sir it be new sight to i the clerk answer when see your four leg above the bush could scarce credit my own eye why be it that you do this thing?""a dry question to answer cry the young come back on to his foot most husky question my fair bird but how flask flask by all that be wonderful he shoot out his hand as he speak and pluck alleyne 's bottle out of his scrip he deftly knock the neck off and pour the half of it down his throat the rest he hand to his comrade who drink the wine and then to the clerk 's increase amazement make show of swallow the bottle with such skill that alleyne seem to see it vanish down his throat moment later however he fling it over his head and catch it bottom downwards upon the calf of his left leg "we thank you for the wine kind sir say he and for the ready courtesy wherewith you offer it touch your question we may tell you that we be stroller and juggler who having perform with much applause at winchester fair be now on our way to the great michaelmas market at ringwood as our art be very fine and delicate one however we can not let day go by without exercise ourselves in it to which end we choose some quiet and sheltered spot where we may break our journey here you find we and we can not wonder that you who be new to tumbling should be astounded since many great baron earl marshal and knight who have wander as far as the holy land be of one mind in say that they have never see more noble or gracious performance if you will be pleased to sit upon that stump we will now continue our exercise "alleyne sit down willingly as direct with two great bundle on either side of he which contain the stroller dress doublet of flame color silk and girdle of leather spangle with brass and tin the juggler be on their head once more bound about with rigid neck play the while in perfect time and tune it chance that out of one of the bundle there stick the end of what the clerk see to be cittern so draw it forth he tune it up
