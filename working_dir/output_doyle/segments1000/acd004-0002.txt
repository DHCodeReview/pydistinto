and twang harmony to the merry lilt which the dancer play on that they drop their own instrument and put their hand to the ground they hop about fast and fast ever shout to he to play more briskly until at last for very weariness all three have to stop "well play sweet poppet cry the young hast rare touch on the string ""how know you the tune ask the other "i know it not do but follow the note hear "both open their eye at this and stare at alleyne with as much amazement as he have show at they "you have fine trick of ear then say one we have long wish to meet such man wilt join we and jog on to ringwood thy duty shall be light and thou shalt have two pence day and meat for supper every night ""with as much beer as you can put away say the other and flask of gascon wine on sabbaths ""nay it may not be have other work to do have tarry with you over long quoth alleyne and resolutely set forth upon his journey once more they run behind he some little way offer he first fourpence and then sixpence day but he only smile and shake his head until at last they fall away from he look back he see that the small have mount on the young 's shoulder and that they stand so some ten foot high wave their adieus to he he wave back to they and then hasten on the light of heart for having fall in with these strange man of pleasure alleyne have go no great distance for all the many small passage that have befall he yet to he use as he be to life of such quiet that the failure of brewing or the altering of an anthem have seem to be of the deep import the quick change play of the light and shadow of life be strangely startling and interesting gulf seem to divide this brisk uncertain existence from the old steady round of work and of prayer which he have leave behind he the few hour that have pass since he see the abbey tower stretch out in his memory until they outgrow whole month of the stagnant life of the cloister as he walk and munch the soft bread from his scrip it seem strange to he to feel that it be still warm from the oven of beaulieu when he pass penerley where be three cottage and barn he reach the edge of the tree country and find the great barren heath of blackdown stretch in front of he all pink with heather and bronze with the fade fern on the left the wood be still thick but the road edge away from they and wind over the open the sun lie low in the west upon purple cloud whence it throw mild chasten light over the wild moorland and glitter on the fringe of forest turn the withered leave into flake of dead gold the bright for the black depth behind they to the see eye decay be as fair as growth and death as life the thought steal into alleyne 's heart as he look upon the autumnal country side and marvel at its beauty he have little time to dwell upon it however for there be still six good mile between he and the near inn he sit down by the roadside to partake of his bread and cheese and then with light scrip he hasten upon his way there appear to be more wayfarer on the down than in the forest first he pass two dominicans in their long black dress who sweep by he with downcast look and pattering lip without so much as glance at he then there come gray friar or minorite with good paunch upon he walk slowly and look about he with the air of man who be at peace with himself and with all man he stop alleyne to ask he whether it be not true that there be hostel somewhere in those part which be especially famous for the stewing of eel the clerk having make answer that he have hear the eel of sowley well speak of the friar suck in his lip and hurry forward close at his heel come three laborer walk abreast with spade and mattock over their shoulder they sing some rude chorus right tunefully as they walk but their english be so coarse and rough that to the ear of cloister breed man it sound like foreign and barbarous tongue one of they carry young bittern which they have catch upon the moor and they offer it to alleyne for silver groat very glad he be to get safely past they for with their bristle red beard and their fierce blue eye they be uneasy man to bargain with upon lonely moor yet it be not always the burliest and the wild who be the most to be dread the worker look hungrily at he and then jog onwards upon their way in slow lumber saxon style bad man to deal with be wooden legged cripple who came hobble down the path so weak and so old to all appearance that child need not stand in fear of he yet when alleyne have pass he of sudden out of pure devilment he scream out curse at he and send jagged flint stone hurtling past his ear so horrid be the causeless rage of the crooked creature that the clerk come over cold thrill and take to his heel until he be out of shot from stone or word it seem to he that in this country of england there be no protection for man save that which lie in the strength of his own arm and the speed of his own foot in the cloister he have hear vague talk of the law the mighty law which be high than prelate or baron yet no sign could he see of it what be the benefit of law write fair upon parchment he wonder if there be no officer to enforce it as it fall out however he have that very evening ere the sun have set chance of see how stern be the grip of the english law when it do happen to seize the offender mile or so out upon the moor the road take very sudden dip into hollow with peat color stream run swiftly down the centre of it to the right of this stand and stand to this day an ancient barrow or bury mound cover deeply in bristle of heather and bracken alleyne be plod down the slope upon one side when he see an old dame come towards he upon the other limp with weariness and lean heavily upon stick when she reach the edge of the stream she stand helpless look to right and to left for some ford where the path run down great stone have be fix in the centre of the brook but it be too far from the bank for her aged and uncertain foot twice she thrust forward at it and twice she draw back until at last give up in despair she sit herself down by the brink and wring her hand wearily there she still sit when alleyne reach the crossing "come mother quoth he it be not so very perilous passage ""alas good youth she answer have humor in the eye and though can see that there be stone there can by no mean be sure as to where it lie ""that be easily amend say he cheerily and pick she lightly up for she be much wear with time he pass across with she he could not but observe however that as he place she down her knee seem to fail she and she could scarcely prop herself up with her staff "you be weak mother say he hast journey far wot ""from wiltshire friend say she in quavering voice three day have be on the road go to my son who be one of the king 's regarder at brockenhurst he have ever say that he would care for i in mine old age ""and rightly too mother since you care for he in his youth but when have you break

man she cry may he make your heart as glad as you have make mine she turn away still mumble blessing and alleyne see her short figure and her long shadow stumble slowly up the slope he be move away himself when his eye light upon strange sight and one which send tingling through his skin out of the tangled scrub on the old overgrown barrow two human face be look out at he the sink sun glimmer full upon they show up every line and feature the one be an oldish man with thin beard crooked nose and broad red smudge from birth mark over his temple the other be negro thing rarely meet in england at that day and rare still in the quiet southland part alleyne have read of such folk but have never see one before and could scarce take his eye from the fellow 's broad pouting lip and shine tooth even as he gaze however the two came writhe out from among the heather and come down towards he with such guilty slink carriage that the clerk feel that there be no good in they and hasten onwards upon his way he have not gain the crown of the slope when he hear sudden scuffle behind he and feeble voice bleat for help look round there be the old dame down upon the roadway with her red whimple fly on the breeze while the two rogue black and white stoop over she wrest away from she the penny and such other poor trifle as be worth the taking at the sight of her thin limb struggle in weak resistance such glow of fierce anger pass over alleyne as set his head in whirl drop his scrip he bound over the stream once more and make for the two villain with his staff whirl over his shoulder and his gray eye blaze with fury the robber however be not disposed to leave their victim until they have work their wicked will upon she the black man with the woman 's crimson scarf tie round his swarthy head stand forward in the centre of the path with long dull colored knife in his hand while the other wave ragged cudgel curse at alleyne and dare he to come on his blood be fairly aflame

of grace and pick up his dagger again he came steal with prowl step and murderous eye while the two sway backwards and forwards stagger this way and that in the very midst of the scuffle however whilst alleyne brace himself to feel the cold blade between his shoulder there come sudden scurry of hoofs and the black man yell with terror and run for his life through the heather the man with the birth mark too struggle to break away and alleyne hear his tooth chatter and feel his limb grow limp to his hand at this sign of come aid the clerk hold on the tight and at last be able to pin his man
