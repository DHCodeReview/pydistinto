the fire be furnish by three torch stick in socket on the wall which flicker and crackled give forth strong resinous odor all this be novel and strange to the cloister breed youth but most interesting of all be the motley circle of guest who sit eat their collop round the blaze they be humble group of wayfarer such as might have be find that night in any inn through the length and breadth of england but to he they represent that vague world against which he have be so frequently and so earnestly warn it do not seem to he from what he could see of it to be such very wicked place after all

spoon with the other in the corner very fat man be lie all sprawl upon truss snore stertorously and evidently in the last stage of drunkenness "that be wat the limner quoth the landlady sit down beside alleyne and point with the ladle to the sleep man that be he who paint the sign and the token alack and alas that ever should have be fool enough to trust he now young man what manner of bird would you suppose pied merlin to be that be the proper sign of my hostel?""why say alleyne merlin be bird of the same form as an eagle or falcon can well remember that learn brother bartholomew who be

dame to give i those three pigment pot and the brush and shall try whether can not better this painting "dame eliza look doubtfully at he as though fear some other stratagem but as he make no demand for ale she finally bring the paint and watch he as he smear on his background talk the while about the folk round the fire "the four forest lad must be jog soon she say they bide at emery down mile or more from here yeoman pricker they be who tend to the king 's hunt the gleeman be call floyting will he come from the north country but for many year he hath go the round of the forest from

redvers and the other he with the sheepskin be as hear villein from the midland who hath run from his master his year and day be well nigh up when he will be free man ""and the other ask alleyne in whisper he be surely some very great man for he look as though he scorn those who be about he "the landlady look at he in motherly way and shake her head you have have no great truck with the world she say or you would have learn that it be the small man and not the great who hold their nose in the air look at those shield upon my wall and under my eave each of they be the device of some noble
