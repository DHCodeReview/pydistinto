of the company ""oh for that say the other count it not fly for have promise myself good hour ago that should go with thee since the life seem to be goodly and proper one yet would fain have have the feather bed ""i doubt it not mon ami quoth the archer go back to his tankard here be to thee lad and may we be good comrade to each other but hola what be it that ail our friend of the wrathful face?"the unfortunate limner have be sit up rub himself ruefully and stare about with vacant gaze which show that he know neither where he be nor what have occur to he suddenly however flash of intelligence have come over his sodden feature and he rise and stagger for the door ware the ale he say in hoarse whisper shake warning finger at the company oh holy virgin ware the ale and slap his hand to his injury he flit off into the darkness amid shout of laughter in which the vanquish join as merrily as the victor the remain forester and the two laborer be also ready for the road and the rest of the company turn to the blanket which dame eliza and the maid have lay out for they upon the floor alleyne weary with the unwonted excitement of the day be soon in deep slumber break only by fleeting vision of twitter leg curse beggar black robber and the many strange folk whom he have meet at the pied merlin "at early dawn the country inn be all alive for it be rare indeed that an hour of daylight would be waste at time when lighting be so scarce and dear indeed early as it be when dame eliza begin to stir it seem that other could be early still for the door be ajar and the learn student of cambridge have take himself off with mind which be too intent upon the high thing of antiquity to stoop to consider the four pence which he owe for bed and board it be the shrill out cry of the landlady when she find her loss and the clucking of the hen which have stream in through the open door that first break in upon the slumber of the tired wayfarer once afoot it be not long before the company begin to disperse sleek mule with red trapping be bring round from some neighboring shed for the physician and he amble away with much dignity upon his road to southampton the tooth drawer and the gleeman call for cup of small ale apiece and start off together for ringwood fair the old jongleur look very yellow in the eye and swell in the face after his overnight potation the archer however who have drink more than any man in the room be as merry as grig and having kiss the matron and chase the maid up the ladder once more he go out to the brook and come back with the water dripping from his face and hair "hola my man of peace he cry to alleyne whither be you bent this morning?""to minstead quoth he my brother simon edricson be socman there and go to bide with he for while prythee let i have my score good dame ""score indeed cry she stand with upraised hand in front of the panel on which alleyne have work the night before say rather what it be that owe to thee good youth aye this be indeed pied merlin and with leveret under its claws as be live woman by the rood of waltham but thy touch be deft and dainty ""and see the red eye of it cry the maid "aye and the open beak ""and the ruffled wing add hordle john "by my hilt cry the archer it be the very bird itself "the young clerk flush with pleasure at this chorus of praise rude and indiscriminate indeed and yet so much hearty and less grudging than any which he have ever hear from the critical brother jerome or the short speak abbot there be it would seem great kindness as well as great wickedness in this world of which he have hear so little that be good his hostess would hear nothing of his pay either for bed or for board while the archer and hordle john place hand upon either shoulder and lead he off to the board where some smoking fish dish of spinach and jug of milk be lay out for their breakfast "i should not be surprised to learn mon camarade say the soldier as he heap slice of fish upon alleyne 's tranchoir of bread that you could read write thing since you be so ready with your brush and pigment ""it would be shame to the good brother of beaulieu if could not he answer see that have be their clerk this ten year back "the bowman look at he with great respect think of that say he and you with not hair to your face and skin like girl can shoot three hundred and fifty pace with my little popper there and four hundred and twenty with the great war bow yet can make nothing of this nor read my own name if you be to set sam aylward up against i in the whole company there be only one man who could read and he fall down well at the taking of ventadour which prove that the thing be not suit to soldier though most needful to clerk ""i can make some show at it say big john though be scarce long enough among the monk to catch the whole trick of it "here then be something to try upon quoth the archer pull square of parchment from the inside of his tunic it be tie securely with broad band of purple silk and firmly seal at either end with large red seal john pore long and earnestly over the inscription upon the back with his brow bent as one who bear up against great mental strain "not having read much of late he say be loth to say too much about what this may be some might say one thing and some another just as one bowman love the yew and second will not shoot save with the ash to i by the length and the look of it should judge this to be verse from one of the psalms "the bowman shake his head it be scarce likely he say that sir claude latour should send i all the way across sea with nought more weighty than psalm verse you have clean overshot the butts this time mon camarade give it to the little one will wager my feather bed that he make more sense of it ""why it be write in the french tongue say alleyne and in right clerkly hand this be how it run le moult puissant et moult honorable chevalier sir nigel loring de christchurch de son tre fidele ami sir claude latour capitaine de la compagnie blanche chatelain de biscar grand seigneur de montchateau vavaseur de le renomme gaston comte de foix tenant le droit de la haute justice de la milieu et de la basse which signify in our speech to the very powerful and very honorable knight sir nigel loring of christchurch from his very faithful friend sir claude latour captain of the white company chatelain of biscar grand lord of montchateau and vassal to the renowned gaston count of foix who hold the right of the high justice the middle and the low '""look at that now cry the bowman in triumph that be just what he would have say ""i can see now that it be even so say john examine the parchment again though scarce understand this high middle and low ""by my hilt you would understand it if you be jacques bonhomme the low justice mean that you may fleece he and the middle that you may torture he and the high that you may slay he that be about the truth of it but this be the letter which be to take and since the platter be clean it be time that we truss up and be afoot you come with i mon gro jean and as to you little one where do you say that you journeyed?""to minstead ""ah yes know this forest country well though be bear myself in the hundred of easebourne in the rape of chichester hard by the village of midhurst yet have not word to say against the hampton man for there be no well comrade or truer archer in the whole company than some who learn to loose the string in these very part we shall travel round with you to minstead lad see that it be little out of our way ""i be ready say alleyne right pleased at the thought of such company upon the road "so be not i. must store my plunder at this inn since the hostess be an honest woman hola ma cherie wish to leave with you my gold work my velvet my silk my feather bed my incense boat my ewer my naping linen and all the rest of it take only the money in linen bag and the box of rose color sugar which be gift from my captain to the lady loring wilt guard my treasure for me?""it shall be put in the safe loft good archer come when you may you shall find it ready for you ""now there be true friend cry the bowman take her hand there be bonne amie english land and english woman say and french wine and french plunder shall be back anon mon ange be lonely man my sweeting and must settle some day when the war be over and do mayhap you and ah mechante mechante there be la petite peeping from behind the door now john the sun be over the tree you must be brisker than this when the bugleman blow bows and bills '""i have be wait this time back say hordle john gruffly "then we must be off adieu ma vie the two livre shall settle the score and buy some ribbon against the next kermesse do not forget sam aylward for his heart shall ever be thine alone and thine ma petite so marchon and may st. julian grant we as good quarter elsewhere!"the sun have rise over ashurst and denny wood and be shine brightly though the eastern wind have sharp flavor to it and the leave be flicker thickly from the tree in the high street of lyndhurst the wayfarer have to pick their way for the little town be crowd with the guardsman groom and yeoman pricker who be attach to the king 's hunt the king himself be stay at castle malwood but several of his suite have be compel to seek such quarter as they might find in the wooden or wattle and daub cottage of the village here and there small escutcheon peep from glassless window mark the night 's lodging of knight or baron these coat of arm could be read where scroll would be meaningless and the bowman like most man of his age be well verse in the common symbol of heraldry "there be the saracen 's head of sir bernard brocas quoth he see he last at the ruffle at poictiers some ten year back when he bear himself like man he be the master of the king 's horse and can sing right jovial stave though in that he can not come nigh to sir john chandos who be first at the board or in the saddle three martlet on field azure that must be one of the luttrells by the crescent upon it it should be the second son of old sir hugh who have bolt through his ankle at the intaking of romorantin he having rush into the fray ere his squire have time to clasp his solleret to his greave there too be the hackle which be the old device of the de brays have serve under sir thomas de bray who be as jolly as pie and lusty swordsman until he get too fat for his harness "so the archer gossip as the three wayfarer thread their way among the stamp horse the busy groom and the knot of page and squire who dispute over the merit of their master horse and deer hound as they pass the old church which stand upon mound at the left hand side of the village street the door be fling open and stream of worshipper wind down the slope path come from the morning mass all chatter like cloud of jay alleyne bent knee and doffed hat at the sight of the open door but ere he have finish an ave his comrade be out of sight round the curve of the path and he have to run to overtake they "what he say not one word of prayer before god 's own open house how can ye hope for his blessing upon the day?""my friend say hordle john have pray so much during the last two month not only during the day but at matin laud and the like when could scarce keep my head upon my shoulder for nodding that feel that have somewhat over pray myself ""how can man have too much religion cry alleyne earnestly it be the one thing that availeth man be but beast as he live from day to day eat and drink breathing and sleeping it be only when he raise himself and concern himself with the immortal spirit within he that he become in very truth man bethink ye how sad thing it would be that the blood of the redeemer should be spill to no purpose ""bless the lad if he doth not blush like any girl and yet preach like the whole college of cardinals cry the archer "in truth blush that any one so weak and so unworthy as should try to teach another that which he find it so pass hard to follow himself ""prettily say mon garcon touch that same slaying of the redeemer it be bad business good padre in france read to we from scroll the whole truth of the matter the soldier come upon he in the garden in truth these apostles of his may have be holy man but they be of no great account as man at arm there be one indeed sir peter who smite out like true man but unless he be belie he do but clip varlet 's ear which be no very knightly dee by these ten finger bone have be there with black simon of norwich and but one score pick man of the company we have hold they in play could we do no more we have at least fill the false knight sir judas so full of english arrow that he would curse the day that ever he come on such an errand "the young clerk smile at his companion 's earnestness have he wish help he say he could have summon legion of archangel from heaven so what need have he of your poor bow and arrow besides bethink you of his own word that those who live by the sword shall perish by the sword ""and how could man die well ask the archer if have my wish it would be to fall so not mark you in any mere skirmish of the company but in stricken field with the great lion banner wave over we and the red oriflamme in front amid the shouting of my fellow and the twanging of the string but let it be sword lance or bolt that strike i down for should think it shame to die from an iron ball from the fire crake or bombard or any such unsoldierly weapon which be only fit to scare babe with its foolish noise and smoke ""i have hear much even in the quiet cloister of these new and dreadful engine quoth alleyne it be say though can scarce bring myself to believe it that they will send ball twice as far as bowman can shoot his shaft and with such force as to break through armor of proof ""true enough my lad but while the armorer be thrust in his devil's dust and drop his ball and light his flambeau can very easily loose six shaft or eight maybe so he hath no great vantage after all yet will not deny that at the intaking of town it be well to have good store of bombard be tell that at calais they make dint in the wall that man might put his head into but surely comrade some one who be grievously hurt hath pass along this road before we "all along the woodland track there do indeed run scatter straggling trail of blood mark sometimes in single drop and in other place in broad ruddy gout smudge over the dead leave or crimson the white flint stone "it must be stricken deer say john "nay be woodman enough to see that no deer hath pass this way this morning and yet the blood be fresh but hark to the sound!"they stand listen all three with sidelong head through the silence of the great forest there come swishing whistle sound mingle with the most dolorous groan and the voice of man raise in high quavering kind of song the comrade hurry onwards eagerly and top the brow of small rise they see upon the other side the source from which these strange noise arise tall man much stoop in the shoulder be walk slowly with bended head and clasp hand in the centre of the path he be dress from head to foot in long white linen cloth and high white cap with red cross print upon it his gown be turn back from his shoulder and the flesh there be sight to make man wince for it be all beat to pulp and the blood be soak into his gown and trickle down upon the ground behind he walk small man with his hair touch with gray who be clothe in the same white garb he intone long whine rhyme in the french tongue and at the end of every line he raise thick cord all jag with pellet of lead and smite his companion across the shoulder until the blood spurt again even as the three wayfarer stare however there be sudden change for the small man having finish his song loosen his own gown and hand the scourge to the other who take up the stave once more and lash his companion with all the strength of his bare and sinewy arm so alternately beat and beat they make their dolorous way through the beautiful wood and under the amber arch of the fade beech tree where the calm strength and majesty of nature might serve to rebuke the foolish energy and misspent striving of mankind such spectacle be new to hordle john or to alleyne edricson but the archer treat it lightly as common matter enough "these be the beating friar otherwise call the flagellants quoth he marvel that ye should have come upon none of they before for across the water they be as common as gallybagger have hear that there be no english among they but that they be from france italy and bohemia en avant camarade that we may have speech with they "as they come up to they alleyne could hear the doleful dirge which the beater be chant bring down his heavy whip at the end of each line while the groan of the sufferer form sort of dismal chorus it be in old french and run somewhat in this way or avant entre nous tous frere batton nos charogne bien fort en remembrant la grant misere de dieu et sa piteuse mort qui fut pris en la gent amere et vendus et trai tort et bastu sa chair vierge et dere au nom de ce batton plus fort then at the end of the verse the scourge change hand and the chanting begin anew "truly holy father say the archer in french as they come abreast of they you have beat enough for to day the road be all spot like shamble at martinmas why should ye mishandle yourselves thus?""c' pour vos peche pour vos peche they drone look at the traveller with sad lack lustre eye and then bend to their bloody work once more without heed to the prayer and persuasion which be address to they find all remonstrance useless the three comrade hasten on their way leave these strange traveller to their dreary task "mort dieu cry the bowman there be bucketful or more of my blood over in france but it be all spill in hot fight and should think twice before draw it drop by drop as these friar be do by my hilt our young one here be as white as picardy cheese what be amiss then mon cher?""it be nothing alleyne answer my life have be too quiet be not use to such sight ""ma foi the other cry have never yet see man who be so stout of speech and yet so weak of heart ""not so friend quoth big john it be not weakness of heart for know the lad well his heart be as good as thine or mine but he hath more in his pate than ever you will carry under that tin pot of thine and as consequence he can see far into thing so that they weigh upon he more ""surely to any man it be sad sight say alleyne to see these holy man who have do no sin themselves suffer so for the sin of other saint be they if in this age any may merit so high name ""i count they not fly cry hordle john for who be the well for all their whipping and yowling they be like other friar trow when all be do let they leave their back alone and beat the pride out of their heart ""by the three king there be sooth in what you say remark the archer besides methink if be le bon dieu it would bring i little joy to see poor devil cut the flesh off his bone and should think that he have but small opinion of i that he should hope to please i by such provost marshal work no by my hilt should look with more loving eye upon jolly archer who never harm fall foe and never fear hale one ""doubtless you mean no sin say alleyne if your word be wild it be not for i to judge they can you not see that there be other foe in this world besides frenchmen and as much glory to be gain in conquer they would it not be proud day for knight or squire if he could overthrow seven adversary in the list yet here be we in the list of life and there come the seven black champion against we sir pride sir covetousness sir lust sir anger sir gluttony sir envy and sir sloth let man lay those seven low and he shall have the prize of the day from the hand of the fair queen of beauty even from the virgin mother herself it be for this that these man mortify their flesh and to set we an example who would pamper ourselves overmuch say again that they be god 's own saint and bow my head to they ""and so you shall mon petit reply the archer have not hear man speak well since old dom bertrand die who be at one time chaplain to the white company he be very valiant man but at the battle of brignais he be spit through the body by hainault man at arm for this we have an excommunication read against the man when next we see our holy father at avignon but as we have not his name and know nothing of he save that he ride dapple gray roussin have fear sometimes that the blight may have settle upon the wrong man ""your company have be then to bow knee before our holy father the pope urban the prop and centre of christendom ask alleyne much interested perchance you have yourself set eye upon his august face?""twice
