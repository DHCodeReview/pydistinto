see he say the archer he be lean little rat of man with scab on his chin the first time we have five thousand crown out of he though he make much ado about it the second time we ask ten thousand but it be three day before we could come to term and be of opinion myself that we might have do well by plunder the palace his chamberlain and cardinal come forth as remember to ask whether we would take seven thousand crown with his blessing and plenary absolution or the ten thousand with his solemn ban by bell book and candle we be all of one mind that it be good to have the ten thousand with the curse but in some way they prevail upon sir john so that we be blest and shrive against our will perchance it be as well for the company be in need of it about that time "the pious alleyne be deeply shock by this reminiscence involuntarily he glance up and around to see if there be any trace of those opportune levin flash and thunderbolt which in the acta sanctorum be wo nt so often to cut short the loose talk of the scoffer the autumn sun stream down as brightly as ever and the peaceful red path still wound in front of they through the rustling yellow tint forest nature seem to be too busy with her own concern to heed the dignity of an outraged pontiff yet he feel sense of weight and reproach within his breast as though he have sin himself in give ear to such word the teaching of twenty year cry out against such license it be not until he have throw himself down before one of the many wayside crosse and have pray from his heart both for the archer and for himself that the dark cloud roll back again from his spirit his companion have pass on whilst he be at his orison but his young blood and the fresh morning air both invite he to scamper his staff in one hand and his scrip in the other with springy step and float lock he race along the forest path as active and as graceful as young deer he have not far to go however for on turn corner he come on roadside cottage with wooden fence work around it where stand big john and aylward the bowman stare at something within as he come up with they he see that two little lad the one about nine year of age and the other somewhat old be stand on the plot in front of the cottage each hold out round stick in their left hand with their arm stiff and straight from the shoulder as silent and still as two small statue they be pretty

string finger and his thumb ""aye lad it be that say deep voice from behind alleyne 's shoulder look round the wayfarer see gaunt big boned man with sink cheek and sallow face who have come up behind they he hold up his two hand as he speak and show that the thumb and two first finger have be tear away from each of they "ma foi camarade cry aylward who hath serve thee in so shameful fashion?""it be easy to see friend that you be bear far from the marche of scotland quoth the stranger with bitter smile north of humber there be no man who would not know the handiwork of devil douglas the black

thigh as much as from arm learn also pray you to shoot with dropping shaft for though bowman may at time be call upon to shoot straight and fast yet it be more often that he have to do with town guard behind wall or an arbalestier with his mantlet raise when you can not hope to do he scathe unless your shaft fall straight upon he from the cloud have not draw string for two week but may be able to show ye how such shot should be make he loosen his long bow sling his quiver round to the front and then glance keenly round for fitting mark there be yellow and withered stump some way off see under the droop branch of lofty oak the archer measure the distance with his eye and then draw three shaft he shoot they off with such speed that the first have not reach the mark ere the last be on the string each arrow pass high over the oak and of the three two stick fair into the stump while the third catch in some wandering puff of wind be drive foot or two to one side "good cry the north countryman hearken to he lad he be master bowman your dad say amen to every word he say ""by my hilt say aylward if be to preach on bowmanship the whole long day would scarce give i time for my sermon we have marksman in the company who will notch with shaft every crevice and joint of man at arm 's harness from the clasp of his bassinet to the hinge of his greave but with your favor friend must gather my arrow again for while shaft cost penny poor man can scarce leave they stick in wayside stump we must then on our road again and hope from my heart that you may train these two young goshawks here until they be ready for cast even at such quarry as you speak of "leave the thumbless archer and his brood the wayfarer strike through the scatter hut of emery down and out on to the broad rolling heath cover deep in fern and in heather where drove of the half wild black forest pig be root about amongst the hillock the wood about this point fall away to the left and the right while the road curve upwards and the wind sweep keenly over the swell upland the broad strip of bracken glow red and yellow against the black peaty soil and queenly doe who graze among they turn her white front and her great questioning eye towards the wayfarer alleyne gaze in admiration at the supple beauty of the creature but the archer 's finger play with his quiver and his eye glisten with the fell instinct which urge man to slaughter "tete dieu he growl be this france or even guienne we should have fresh haunch for our none meat law or no law have mind to loose bolt at she ""i would break your stave across my knee first cry john lay his great hand upon the bow what man be forest bear and know what come of it in our own township of hordle two have lose their eye and one his skin for this very thing on my troth feel no great love when first see you but since then have conceive over much regard for you to wish to see the verderer 's flayer at work upon you ""it be my trade to risk my skin growl the archer but none the less he thrust his quiver over his hip again and turn his face for the west as they advance the path still tend upwards run from heath into copse of holly and yew and so back into heath again it be joyful to hear the merry whistle of blackbird as they dart from one clump of greenery to the other now and again peaty amber color stream ripple across their way with ferny over grow bank where the blue kingfisher flit busily from side to side or the gray and pensive heron swell with trout and dignity stand ankle deep among the sedge chatter jay and loud wood pigeon flap thickly overhead while ever and anon the measured tapping of nature 's carpenter the great green woodpecker sound from each wayside grove on either side as the path mount the long sweep of country broaden and expand slope down on the one side through yellow forest and brown moor to the distant smoke of lymington and the blue misty channel which lie alongside the sky line while to the north the wood roll away grove top grove to where in the furth distance the white spire of salisbury stand out hard and clear against the cloudless sky to alleyne whose day have be spend in the low lie coastland the eager upland air and the wide free country side give sense of life and of the joy of living which make his young blood tingle in his vein even the heavy john be not unmove by the beauty of their road while the bowman whistle lustily or sing snatch of french love song in voice which might have scare the most stout hearted maiden that ever hearken to serenade "i have liking for that north countryman he remark presently he hath good power of hatred couldst see by his cheek and eye that he be as bitter as verjuice warm to man who hath some gall in his liver ""ah i sigh alleyne would it not be well if he have some love in his heart?""i would not say nay to that by my hilt shall never be say to be traitor to the little king let man love the sex pasque dieu they be make to be love les petite from whimple down to shoe string be right glad mon garcon to see that the good monk have train thee so wisely and so well ""nay mean not worldly love but rather that his heart should soften towards those who have wrong he "the archer shake his head man should love those of his own breed say he but it be not nature that an english bear man should love scot or frenchman ma foi you have not see drove of nithsdale raider on their galloway nag or you would not speak of love they would as soon take beelzebub himself to my arm fear mon gar that they have teach thee but badly at beaulieu for surely bishop know more of what be right and what be ill than an abbot can do and myself with these very eye see the bishop of lincoln hew into scottish hobeler with battle axe which be pass strange way of show he that he love he "alleyne scarce see his way to argue in the face of so decide an opinion on the part of high dignitary of the church you have bear arm against the scots then he ask "why man first loose string in battle when be but lad young by two year than you at neville 's cross under the lord mowbray later serve under the warden of berwick that very john copeland of whom our friend spake the same who hold the king of scots to ransom ma foi it be rough soldiering and good school for one who would learn to be hardy and war wise ""i have hear that the scots be good man of war say hordle john "for axeman and for spearman have not see their match the archer answer they can travel too with bag of meal and gridiron sling to their sword belt so that it be ill to follow they there be scant crop and few beef in the borderland where man must reap his grain with sickle in one fist and brown bill in the other on the other hand they be the sorry archer that have ever see and can not so much as aim with the arbal to say nought of the long bow again they be mostly poor folk even the noble among they so that there be few who can buy as good brigandine of chain mail as that which be wear and it be ill for they to stand up against our own knight who carry the price of five scotch farm upon their chest and shoulder man for man with equal weapon they be as worthy and valiant man as could be find in the whole of christendom ""and the french ask alleyne to whom the archer 's light gossip have all the relish that the word of the man of action have for the recluse "the french be also very worthy man we have have great good fortune in france and it hath lead to much bobance and camp fire talk but have ever notice that those who know the most have the least to say about it have see frenchmen fight both in open field in the intaking and the defending of town or castlewick in escalado camisade night foray bushment sally outfall and knightly spear running their knight and squire lad be every whit as good as our and could pick out score of those who ride behind du guesclin who would hold the list with sharpen lance against the good man in the army of england on the other hand their common folk be so crush down with gabelle and poll tax and every manner of cursed tallage that the spirit have pass right out of they it be fool 's plan to teach man to be cur in peace and think that he will be lion in war fleece they like sheep and sheep they will remain if the noble have not conquer the poor folk it be like enough that we should not have conquer the noble ""but they must be sorry folk to bow down to the rich in such fashion say big john be but poor commoner of england myself and yet know something of charter liberty franchise usage privilege custom and the like if these be break then all man know that it be time to buy arrow head ""aye but the man of the law be strong in france as well as the man of war by my hilt hold that man have more to fear there from the ink pot of the one than from the iron of the other there be ever some cursed sheepskin in their strong box to prove that the rich man should be rich and the poor man poor it would scarce pass in england but they be quiet folk over the water ""and what other nation have you see in your travel good sir ask alleyne edricson his young mind hunger for plain fact of life after the long course of speculation and of mysticism on which he have be train "i have see the low countryman in arm and have nought to say against he heavy and slow be he by nature and be not to be bring into battle for the sake of lady 's eyelash or the twang of minstrel 's string like the hot blood of the south but ma foi lie hand on his wool bale or trifle with his velvet of bruge and out buzz every stout burgher like bee from the tee hole ready to lay on as though it be his one business in life by our lady they have show the french at courtrai and elsewhere that they be as deft in wield steel as in weld it ""and the man of spain?""they too be very hardy soldier the more so as for many hundred year they have have to fight hard against the cursed follower of the black mahound who have press upon they from the south and still as understand hold the fair half of the country have turn with they upon the sea when they come over to winchelsea and the good queen with her lady sit upon the cliff look down at we as if it have be joust or tourney by my hilt it be sight that be worth the seeing for all that be good in england be out on the water that day we go forth in little ship and come back in great galley for of fifty tall ship of spain over two score fly the cross of st. george ere the sun have set but now youngster have answer you freely and trow it be time that you answer i let thing be plat and plain between we be man who shoot straight at his mark you see the thing have with i at yonder hostel name which you will save only the box of rose colored sugar which take to the lady loring and you shall have it if you will but come with i to france ""nay say alleyne would gladly come with ye to france or where else ye will just to list to your talk and because ye be the only two friend that have in the whole wide world outside of the cloister but indeed it may not be for my duty be towards my brother see that father and mother be dead and he my elder besides when ye talk of take i to france ye do not conceive how useless should be to you see that neither by training nor by nature be fit for the war and there seem to be nought but strife in those part ""that come from my fool 's talk cry the archer for be man of no learn myself my tongue turn to blade and target even as my hand do know then that for every parchment in england there be twenty in france for every statue cut gem shrine carven screen or what else might please the eye of learn clerk there be good hundred to our one at the spoiling of carcasonne have see chamber store with writing though not one man in our company could read they again in arles and nimes and other town that could name there be the great arch and fortalice still stand which be build of old by giant man who come from the south can not see by your brighten eye how you would love to look upon these thing come then with i and by these ten finger bone there be not one of they which you shall not see ""i should indeed love to look upon they alleyne answer but have come from beaulieu for purpose and must be true to my service even as thou art true to thine ""bethink you again mon ami quoth aylward that you might do much good yonder since there be three hundred man in the company and none who have ever word of grace for they and yet the virgin know that there be never set of man who be in more need of it sickerly the one duty may balance the other your brother hath do without you this many year and as gather he hath never walk as far as beaulieu to see you during all that time so he can not be in any great need of you ""besides say john the socman of minstead be by word through the forest from bramshaw hill to holmesley walk he be drunken brawling perilous churl as you may find to your cost ""the more reason that should strive to mend he quoth alleyne there be no need to urge i friend for my own wish would draw i to france and it would be joy to i if could go with you but indeed and indeed it can not be so here take my leave of you for yonder square tower amongst the tree upon the right must surely be the church of minstead and may reach it by this path through the wood ""well god be with thee lad cry the archer press alleyne to his heart be quick to love and quick to hate and fore god be loth to part ""would it not be well say john that we should wait here and see what manner of greet you have from your brother you may prove to be as welcome as the king 's purveyor to the village dame ""nay nay he answer ye must not bide for i for where go stay ""yet it may be as well that you should know whither we go say the archer we shall now journey south through the wood until we come out upon the christchurch road and so onwards hope to night to reach the castle of sir william montacute earl of salisbury of which sir nigel loring be constable there we shall bide and it be like enough that for month or more you may find we there ere we be ready for our viage back to france "it be hard indeed for alleyne to break away from these two new but hearty friend and so strong be the combat between his conscience and his inclination that he dared not look round lest his resolution should slip away from he it be not until he be deep among the tree trunk that he cast glance backwards when he find that he could still see they through the branch on the road above he the archer be stand with fold arm his bow jut from over his shoulder and the sun gleam brightly upon his head piece and the link of his chain mail beside he stand his giant recruit still clothe in the home spin and ill fitting garment of the fuller of lymington with arm and leg shoot out of his scanty garb even as alleyne watch they they turn upon their heel and plod off together upon their way the path which the young clerk have now to follow lie through magnificent forest of the very heavy timber where the giant bowl of oak and of beech form long aisle in every direction shoot up their huge branch to build the majestic arch of nature 's own cathedral beneath lie broad carpet of the soft and green moss fleck over with fall leave but yield pleasantly to the foot of the traveller the track which guide he be one so seldom use that in place it lose itself entirely among the grass to reappear as reddish rut between the distant tree trunk it be very still here in the heart of the woodland the gentle rustle of the branch and the distant cooing of pigeon be the only sound which break in upon the silence save that once alleyne hear afar off merry call upon hunt bugle and the shrill
