and the whole fabric of the feudal system be totter to fall hence the fierce muttering of the low class and the constant discontent break out into local tumult and outrage and culminate some year later in the great rising of tyler what alleyne see and wonder at in hampshire would have appeal equally to the traveller in any other english county from the channel to the marche of scotland he be follow the track his misgiving increase with every step which take he near to that home which he have never see when of sudden the tree begin to thin and the sward to spread out onto broad green lawn where five cow lie in the sunshine and drove of black swine wander unchecked brown forest stream swirl down the centre of this clearing with rude bridge fling across it and on the other side be second

sunshine it lie as peacefully and as still as he have oft picture it to himself in his dream he be rouse however from his pleasant reverie by the sound of voice and two people emerge from the forest some little way to his right and move across the field in the direction of the bridge the one be man with yellow flow beard and very long hair of the same tint droop over his shoulder his dress of good norwich cloth and his assured bearing mark he as man of position while the sombre hue of his clothe and the absence of all ornament contrast with the flash and glitter which have mark the king 's retinue by his side walk woman tall and slight and dark with lithe graceful figure and clear cut compose feature her jet black hair be gather back under light pink coif her head poise proudly upon her neck and her step long and springy like that of some wild tireless woodland creature she hold her left hand in front of she cover with red velvet glove and on the wrist little brown falcon very fluffy

have read and have hear of love and of lover such be these doubtless this golden bearded man and the fair damsel with the cold proud face why else should they wander together in the wood or be so lose in talk by rustic stream and yet as he watch uncertain whether to advance from the cover or to choose some other path to the house he soon come to doubt the truth of this first conjecture the man stand tall and square block the entrance to the bridge and throw out his hand as he speak in wild eager fashion while the deep tone of his stormy voice rise at time into accent of menace and of anger she stand fearlessly in front of he still stroke her bird but twice she throw swift questioning glance over her shoulder as one who be in search of aid so move be the young clerk by these mute appeal that he come forth from the tree and cross the meadow uncertain what to do and yet loth to hold back from one who might need his aid so intent be they upon each other that neither take note of his approach until when he be close upon they the man throw his arm roughly round the damsel 's waist and draw she towards he she strain she lithe supple figure away and strike fiercely at he while the hood hawk scream with ruffled wing and peck blindly in its mistress 's defence bird and maid however have but little chance against their assailant who laugh loudly catch her wrist in one hand while he draw she towards he with the other "the good rise have ever the long thorn say he quiet little one or you may do yourself hurt must pay saxon toll on saxon land my proud maude for all your air and
