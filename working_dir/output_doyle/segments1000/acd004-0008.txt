my sake for can not go and leave you here ""come then say he and they run together to the cover of the wood as they gain the edge of the brushwood alleyne look back see his brother come run out of the house again with the sun gleam upon his hair and his beard he hold something which flash in his right hand and he stoop at the threshold to unloose the black hound "this way the woman whisper in low eager voice through the bush to that fork ash do not heed i can run as fast as you trow now into the stream right in over ankle to throw the dog off though think it be but common cur like its master as she speak she spring herself into the shallow stream and run swiftly up the centre of it with the brown water bubble over her foot and her hand out stretch toward the cling branch of bramble or saple alleyne follow close at her heel with his mind in whirl at this black welcome and sudden shifting of all his plan and hope yet grave as be his thought they would still turn to wonder as he look at the twinkle foot of his guide and see her lithe figure bend this way and that dip under bough spring over stone with lightness and ease which make it no small task for he to keep up with she at last when he be almost out of breath she suddenly throw herself down upon mossy bank between two holly bush and look ruefully at her own dripping foot and bedraggle skirt "holy mary say she what shall do mother will keep i to my chamber for month and make i work at the tapestry of the nine bold knight she promise as much last week when fall into wilverley bog and yet she know that can not abide needle work "alleyne still stand in the stream glance down at the graceful pink and white figure the curve of raven black hair and the proud sensitive face which look up frankly and confidingly at his own "we have well on he say he may yet overtake we ""not so we be well off his land now nor can he tell in this great wood which way we have take but you you have he at your mercy why do you not kill him?""kill he my brother!""and why not with quick gleam of her white tooth he would have kill you know he and read it in his eye have have your staff would have try aye and do it too she shake she clench white hand as she speak and her lip tighten ominously "i be already sad in heart for what have do say he sit down on the bank and sink his face into his hand god help i all that be bad in i seem to come uppermost another instant and have smite he the son of my own mother the man whom have long to take to my heart alas that should still be so weak ""weak she exclaim raise her black eyebrow do not think that even my father himself who be hard judge of manhood would call you that but it be as you may think sir very pleasant thing for i to hear that you be grieve at what you have do and can but rede that we should go back together and you should make your peace with the socman by hand back your prisoner it be sad thing that so small thing as woman should come between two who be of one blood "simple alleyne open his eye at this little spurt of feminine bitterness nay lady say he that be bad of all what man would be so caitiff and thrall as to fail you at your need have turn my brother against i and now alas appear to have give you offence also with my clumsy tongue but indeed lady be tear both way and can scarce grasp in my mind what it be that have befall ""nor can marvel at that say she with little tinkle laugh you come in as the knight do in the jongleur 's romance between dragon and damsel with small time for the asking of question come she go on spring to her foot and smooth down her rumpled frock let we walk through the shaw together and we may come upon bertrand with the horse if poor troubadour have not cast shoe we should not have have this trouble nay must have your arm for though speak lightly now that all be happily over be as frightened as my brave roland see how his chest heave and his dear feather all awry the little knight who would not have his lady mishandle so she prattle on to her hawk while alleyne walk by her side steal glance from time to time at this queenly and wayward woman in silence they wander together over the velvet turf and on through the broad minstead wood where the old lichen drape beech throw their circle of black shadow upon the sunlit sward "you have no wish then to hear my story say she at last "if it please you to tell it i he answer "oh she cry toss her head if it be of so little interest to you we have well let it bide ""nay say he eagerly would fain hear it ""you have right to know it if you have lose brother 's favor through it and yet ah well you be as understand clerk so must think of you as one step far in order and make you my father confessor know then that this man have be suitor for my hand less as think for my own sweet sake than because he hath ambition and have it on his mind that he might improve his fortune by dip into my father 's strong box though the virgin know that he would have find little enough therein my father however be proud man gallant knight and try soldier of the old blood to whom this man 's churlish birth and low descent oh lackaday have forget that he be of the same strain as yourself ""nay trouble not for that say alleyne we be all from good mother eve ""streams may spring from one source and yet some be clear and some be foul quoth she quickly but to be brief over the matter my father would have none of his wooing nor in sooth would i. on that he swear vow against we and as he be know to be perilous man with many outlaw and other at his back my father forbid that should hawk or hunt in any part of the wood to the north of the christchurch road as it chance however this morning my little roland here be loose at strong winged heron and page bertrand and ride on with no thought but for the sport until we find ourselves in minstead wood small harm then but that my horse troubadour trod with tender foot upon sharp stick rear and throw i to the ground see to my gown the third that have befoul within the week woe worth i when agatha the tire woman set eye upon it!""and what then lady ask alleyne "why then away run troubadour for belike spur he in fall and bertrand ride after he as hard as hoofs could bear he when rise there be the socman himself by my side with the news that be on his land but with so many courteous word besides and such gallant bearing that he prevail upon i to come to his house for shelter there to wait until the page return by the grace of the virgin and the help of my patron st. magdalen stop short ere reach his door though as you see he strove to hale i up to it and then ah she shiver and chatter like one in an ague fit "what be it cry alleyne look about in alarm "nothing friend nothing be but think how bit into his hand soon would bite live toad or poison snake oh shall loathe my lip forever but you how brave you be and how quick how meek for yourself and how bold for stranger if be man should wish to do what you have do ""it be small thing he answer with tingle of pleasure at these sweet word of praise but you what will you do?""there be great oak near here and think that bertrand will bring the horse there for it be an old hunting tryst of ours then hey for home and no more hawk to day twelve mile gallop will dry foot and skirt ""but your father?""not one word shall tell he you do not know he but can tell you he be not man to disobey as have disobey he he would avenge i it be true but it be not to he that shall look for vengeance some day perchance in joust or in tourney knight may wish to wear my color and then shall tell he that if he do indeed crave my favor there be wrong unredressed and the wronger the socman of minstead so my knight shall find venture such as bold knight love and my debt shall be pay and my father none the wiser and one rogue the less in the world say be not that brave plan?""nay lady it be thought which be unworthy of you how can such as you speak of violence and of vengeance be none to be gentle and kind none to be piteous and forgive alas it be hard cruel world and would that have never leave my abbey cell to hear such word from your lip be as though hear an angel of grace preach the devil 's own creed "she start from he as young colt who first feel the bit gramercy for your rede young sir she say with little curtsey as understand your word you be grieve that you ever meet i and look upon i as preach devil why my father be bitter man when he be wroth but hath never call i such name as that it may be his right and duty but certe it be none of thine so it would be good since you think so lowly of i that you should take this path to the left while keep on upon this one for it be clear that can be no fit companion for you so say with downcast lid and dignity which be somewhat mar by her bedraggle skirt she sweep off down the muddy track leave alleyne stand stare ruefully after she he wait in vain for some backward glance or sign of relent but she walk on with rigid neck until her dress be only white flutter among the leave then with sink head and heavy heart he plod wearily down the other path wroth with himself for the rude and uncouth tongue which have give offence where so little be intend he have go some way lose in doubt and in self reproach his mind all tremulous with thousand new find thought and fear and wonderment when of sudden there be light rustle of the leave behind he and glance round there be this graceful swift footed creature tread in his very shadow with her proud head bow even as his be the picture of humility and repentance "i shall not vex you nor even speak she say but would fain keep with you while we be in the wood ""nay you can not vex i he answer all warm again at the very sight of she it be my rough word which vex you but have be throw among man all my life and indeed with all the will scarce know how to temper my speech to lady 's ear ""then unsay it cry she quickly say that be right to wish to have vengeance on the socman ""nay can not do that he answer gravely "then who be ungentle and unkind now she cry in triumph how stern and cold you be for one so young art surely no mere clerk but bishop or cardinal at the least shouldst have crozier for staff and mitre for cap well well for your sake will forgive the socman and take vengeance on none but on my own wilful self who must need run into danger 's path so will that please you sir?""there speak your true self say he and you will find more pleasure in such forgiveness than in any vengeance "she shake her head as if by no mean assure of it and then with sudden little cry which have more of surprise than of joy in it here be bertrand with the horses!"down the glade there come little green clothe page with laugh eye and long curl float behind he he sat perch on high bay horse and hold on to the bridle of spirited black palfrey the hide of both glisten from long run "i have seek you everywhere dear lady maude say he in piping voice spring down from his horse and hold the stirrup troubadour gallop as far as holmhill ere could catch he trust that you have have no hurt or scath he shoot questioning glance at alleyne as he speak "no bertrand say she thank to this courteous stranger and now sir she continue spring into her saddle it be not fit that leave you without word more clerk or no you have act this day as become true knight king arthur and all his table could not have do more it may be that as some small return my father or his kin may have power to advance your interest he be not rich but he be honor and hath great friend tell i what be your purpose and see if he may not aid it ""alas lady have now no purpose have but two friend in the world and they have go to christchurch where it be likely shall join they ""and where be christchurch?""at the castle which be hold by the brave knight sir nigel loring constable to the earl of salisbury "to his surprise she burst out laugh and spur her palfrey dash off down the glade with her page ride behind she not one word do she say but as she vanish amid the tree she half turn in her saddle and wave last greeting long time he stand half hope that she might again come back to he but the thud of the hoofs have die away and there be no sound in all the wood but the gentle rustle and dropping of the leave at last he turn away and make his way back to the high road another person from the light hearted boy who have leave it short three hour before if he might not return to beaulieu within the year and if his brother 's dog be to be set upon he if he show face upon minstead land then indeed he be adrift upon earth north south east and west he might turn where he would but all be equally chill and cheerless the abbot have roll ten silver crown in lettuce leaf and hide they away in the bottom of his scrip but that would be sorry support for twelve long month in all the darkness there be but the one bright spot of the sturdy comrade whom he have leave that morning if he could find they again all would be well the afternoon be not very advanced for all that have befall he when man be afoot at cock crow much may be do in the day if he walk fast he might yet overtake his friend ere they reach their destination he push on therefore now walk and now run as he journey he bite into crust which remain from his beaulieu bread and he wash it down by draught from woodland stream it be no easy or light thing to journey through this great forest which be some twenty mile from east to west and good sixteen from bramshaw woods in the north to lymington in the south alleyne however have the good fortune to fall in with woodman axe upon shoulder trudge along in the very direction that he wish to go with his guidance he pass the fringe of bolderwood walk famous for old ash and yew through mark ash with its giant beech tree and on through the knightwood grove where the giant oak be already great tree but only one of many comely brother they plod along together the woodman and alleyne with little talk on either side for their thought be as far asunder as the pole the peasant 's gossip have be of the hunt of the bracken of the gray head kite that have nest in wood fidley and of the great catch of herre bring back by the boat of pitt 's deep the clerk 's mind be on his brother on his future above all on this strange fierce melting beautiful woman who have break so suddenly into his life and as suddenly pass out of it again sodistraitwa he and so random his answer that the woodman take to whistling and soon branch off upon the track to burley leave alleyne upon the main christchurch road down this he push as fast as he might hope at every turn and rise to catch sight of his companion of the morning from vinney ridge to rhinefield walk the wood grow thick and dense up to the very edge of the track but beyond the country open up into broad dun color moor fleck with clump of tree and top each other in long low curve up to the dark line of forest in the furth distance cloud of insect dance and buzz in the golden autumn light and the air be full of the piping of the song bird long glint dragonfly shoot across the path or hang tremulous with gauzy wing and gleaming body once white necked sea eagle soar scream high over the traveller 's head and again flock of brown bustard pop up from among the bracken and blunder away in their clumsy fashion half run half fly with strident cry and whirr of wing there be folk too to be meet upon the road beggar and courier chapman and tinker cheery fellow for the most part with rough jest and homely greet for each other and for alleyne near shotwood he come upon five seaman on their way from poole to southampton rude red face man who shout at he in jargon which he could scarce understand and hold out to he great pot from which they have be drink nor would they let he pass until he have dip pannikin in and take mouthful which set he cough and choke with the tear run down his cheek far on he meet sturdy black bearded man mount on brown horse with rosary in his right hand and long two handed sword jangle against his stirrup iron by his black robe and the eight point cross upon his sleeve alleyne recognize he as one of the knights hospitallers of st. john of jerusalem whose presbytery be at baddesley he hold up two finger as he pass with benedic fili mi whereat alleyne doff hat and bent knee look with much reverence at one who have devote his life to the overthrow of the infidel poor simple lad he have not learn yet that what man be and what man profess to be be very wide asunder and that the knights of st. john having come into large part of the rich of the ill fate templars be very much too comfortable to think of exchange their palace for tent or the cellar of england for the thirsty desert of syria yet ignorance may be more precious than wisdom for alleyne as he walk on brace himself to high life by the thought of this other 's sacrifice and strengthen himself by his example which he could scarce have do have he know that the hospitaller 's mind run more upon malmsey than on mamelukes and on venison rather than victory as he press on the plain turn to wood once more in the region of wilverley walk and cloud sweep up from the south with the sun shine through the chink of it few great drop come patter loudly down and then in moment the steady swish of brisk shower with the dripping and dropping of the leave alleyne glance round for shelter see thick and lofty holly bush so hollow out beneath that no house could have be dry under this canopy of green two man be already squat who wave their hand to alleyne that he should join they as he approach he see that they have five dry herring lay out in front of they with great hunch of wheaten bread and leathern flask full of milk but instead of set to at their food they appear to have forget all about it and be dispute together with flushed face and angry gesture it be easy to see by their dress and manner that they be two of those wander student who form about this time so enormous multitude in every country in europe the one be long and thin with melancholy feature while the other be fat and sleek with loud voice and the air of man who be not to be gainsay "come hither good youth he cry come hither!vultu ingenui puer heed not the face of my good coz here foenum habet in cornu as don horace have it but warrant he harmless for all that ""stint your bull 's bellowing exclaim the other if it come to horace have line in my mind loquace si sapiat how doth it run the english o't be that man of sense should ever avoid great talker that be so if all be man of sense then thou wouldst be lonesome man coz ""alas dicon fear that your logic be as bad as your philosophy or your divinity and god wot it would be hard to say bad word than that for it for hark ye grant propter argumentum that

which be exactly what have be din into your long ear ever since first clap eye on your sunken chop ""tut tut cry the other your tongue go like the clapper of mill wheel sit down here friend and partake of this herring understand first however that there be certain condition attach to it ""i have hope say alleyne fall into the humor of the twain that tranchoir of bread and draught of milk
