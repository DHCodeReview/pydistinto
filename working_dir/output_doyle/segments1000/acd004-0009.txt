dispute across his knee lean forward with flushed face and dart hand in all the heat of argument never have he hear such jargon of scholastic philosophy such fine draw distinction such cross fire of major and minor proposition syllogism attack and refutation question clatter upon answer like sword on buckler the ancient the father of the church the modern the scripture the arabians be each send hurtle against the other while the rain still drip and the dark holly leave glisten with the moisture at last the fat man seem to weary of it for he set to work quietly upon his meal while his opponent as proud as the rooster who be leave unchallenged upon the midden crow away in last long burst of quotation and deduction suddenly however his eye drop upon his food and he give howl of dismay "you double thief he cry you have eat my herring and without bite or sup since morning ""that quoth the other complacently be my final argument my crowning effort orperoratio as the orator have it for coz since all thought be thing you have but to think pair of herring and then conjure up pottle of milk wherewith to wash they down ""a brave piece of reasoning cry the other and know of but one reply to it on which lean forward he catch his comrade rousing smack across his rosy cheek nay take it not amiss he say since all thing be but thought then that also be but thought and may be disregard "this last argument however by no mean commend itself to the pupil of ockham who pluck great stick from the ground and signify his dissent by smite the realist over the pate with it by good fortune the wood be so light and rotten that it go to thousand splinter but alleyne think it well to leave the twain to settle the matter at their leisure the more so as the sun be shine brightly once more look back down the pool strew road he see the two excited philosopher wave their hand and shout at each other but their babble soon become mere drone in the distance and turn in the road hide they from his sight and now after pass holmesley walk and the wooton heath the forest begin to shred out into scatter belt of tree with gleam of corn field and stretch of pasture land between here and there by the wayside stand little knot of wattle and daub hut with shock haired laborer lounge by the door and red cheek child sprawl in the roadway back among the grove he could see the high gable end and thatch roof of the franklin house on whose field these man find employment or more often thick dark column of smoke mark their position and hint at the coarse plenty within by these sign alleyne know that he be on the very fringe of the forest and therefore no great way from christchurch the sun be lie low in the west and shoot its level ray across the long sweep of rich green country glint on the white fleece sheep and throw long shadow from the red kine who wade knee deep in the juicy clover right glad be the traveller to see the high tower of christchurch priory gleam in the mellow evening light and gladder still when on round corner he come upon his comrade of the morning seat astraddle upon fallen tree they have flat space before they on which they alternately throw little square piece of bone and be so intent upon their occupation that they never raise eye as he approach they he observe with astonishment as he draw near that the archer 's bow be on john 's back the archer 's sword by john 's side and the steel cap lay upon the tree trunk between they "mort de ma vie aylward shout look down at the dice never have such cursed luck murrain on the bone have not throw good main since leave navarre one and three en avant camarade!""four and three cry hordle john count on his great finger that make seven ho archer have thy cap now have at thee for thy

eye he spring up and throw his arm round alleyne 's neck while john no less pleased but more backward and saxon in his habit stand grin and bob by the wayside with his newly win steel cap stick wrong side foremost upon his tangle of red hair "hast come to stop cry the bowman pat alleyne all over in his delight shall not get away from we again!""i wish no well say he with pringling in the eye at this hearty greeting "well say lad cry big john we three shall to the war together and the devil may fly away with the abbot of beaulieu but your foot and hosen be all besmudge hast be in the water or be the more mistaken ""i have in good sooth alleyne answer and then as they journey on their way he tell they the many thing that have befall he his meeting with the villein his sight of the king his come upon his brother with all the tale of the black welcome and of the fair damsel they stride on either side each with an ear slant towards he but ere he have come to the end of his story the bowman have spin round upon his heel and be hasten back the way they have come breathe loudly through his nose "what then ask alleyne trot after he and grip at his jerkin "i be back for minstead lad ""and why in the name of sense?""to thrust handful of steel into the socman what hale demoiselle against her will and then loose dog at his own brother let i go!""nenny nenny cry alleyne laugh there be no scath do come back friend and so by mingle push and entreaty they get his head round for christchurch once more yet he walk with his chin upon his shoulder until catch sight of maiden by wayside well the smile come back to his face and peace to his heart "but you say alleyne there have be change with you also why should not the workman carry his tool where be bow and sword and cap and why so warlike john?""it be game which friend aylward hath be teaching of i ""and find he an over apt pupil grumble the bowman he hath strip i as though have fall into the hand of the tardvenus but by my hilt you must render they back to i camarade lest you bring discredit upon my mission and will pay you for they at armorer price ""take they back man and never heed the pay say john do but wish to learn the feel of they since be like to have such trinket hang to my own girdle for some year to come ""ma foi he be bear for free companion cry aylward he hath the very trick of speech and turn of thought take they back then and indeed it give i unease not to feel my yew stave tapping against my leg bone but see me garcon on this side of the church rise the square and darkle tower of earl salisbury 's castle and even from here seem to see on yonder banner the red roebuck of the montacutes ""red upon white say alleyne shade his eye but whether roebuck or no be more than could vouch how black be the great tower and how bright the gleam of arm upon the wall see below the flag how it twinkle like star!""aye it be the steel head piece of the watchman remark the archer but we must on if we be to be there before the drawbridge rise at the vesper bugle for it be likely that sir nigel be so renowned soldier may keep hard discipline within the wall and let no man enter after sundown so say he quicken his pace and the three comrade be soon close to the straggling and broad spread town which center round the noble church and the frowning castle it chance on that very evening that sir

befit both their age and their condition while they watch with smile in their eye the scramble crowd in front of they they pause however at the bridge and lean their elbow upon the stonework they stand look down at their own face in the glassy stream and at the swift flash of speckled trout against the tawny gravel sir nigel be slight man of poor stature with soft lisping voice and gentle way
