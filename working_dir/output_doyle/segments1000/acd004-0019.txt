the river run deep and swift up to the steep bank but there be few boat upon it and the ship be moor far out in the centre of the stream here the two combatant draw their sword and throw off their doublet for neither have any defensive armor the duello with its stately etiquette have not yet come into vogue but rough and sudden encounter be as common as they must ever be when hot head youth go abroad with weapon strapped to its waist in such combat as well as in the more formal sport of the tilting yard tranter have win name for strength and dexterity which have cause norbury to utter his well mean warning on the other hand alleyne have use his weapon in constant exercise and practice on every day for many month and be by nature quick of eye and prompt of hand he might pass now as no mean swordsman strangely opposed pair they appear as they approach each other tranter dark and stout and stiff with hairy chest and cord arm alleyne model of comeliness and grace with his golden hair and his skin as fair as woman 's an unequal fight it seem to most but there be few and they the most experienced who see something in the youth 's steady gray eye and wary step which leave the issue open to doubt "hold sir hold cry norbury ere blow have be strike this gentleman hath two handed sword good foot long than that of our friend ""take mine alleyne say ford "nay friend he answer understand the weight and balance of mine own to work sir for our lord may need we at the abbey!"tranter 's great sword be indeed mighty vantage in his favor he stand with his foot close together his knee bent outward ready for dash inward or spring out the weapon he hold straight up in front of he with blade erect so that he might either bring it down with swinge blow or by turn of the heavy blade he might guard his own head and body further protection lie in the broad and powerful guard which cross the hilt and which be furnish with deep and narrow notch in which an expert swordsman might catch his foeman 's blade and by quick turn of his wrist might snap it across alleyne on the other hand must trust for his defence to his quick eye and active foot for his sword though keen as whetstone could make it be of light and graceful build with narrow slope pommel and taper steel tranter well know his advantage and lose no time in put it to use as his opponent walk towards he he suddenly bound forward and send in whistling cut which would have sever the other in twain have he not spring lightly back from it so close be it that the point rip gash in the jutting edge of his linen cycla quick as panther alleyne spring in with thrust but tranter who be as active as he be strong have already recover himself and turn it aside with movement of his heavy blade again he whiz in blow which make the spectator hold their breath and again alleyne very quickly and swiftly slip from under it and send back two lightning thrust which the other could scarce parry so close be they to each other that alleyne have no time to spring back from the next cut which beat down his sword and graze his forehead send the blood stream into his eye and down his cheek he spring out beyond sword sweep and the pair stand breathe heavily while the crowd of young squire buzz their applause "bravely strike on both side cry roger harcomb you have both win honor from this meeting and it would be sin and shame to let it go far ""you have do enough edricson say norbury "you have carry yourself well cry several of the old squire "for my part have no wish to slay this young man say tranter wipe his heated brow "does this gentleman crave my pardon for having use i despitefully ask alleyne "nay not i.""then stand on your guard sir with clatter and dash the two blade meet once more alleyne press in so as to keep within the full sweep of the heavy blade while tranter as continually spring back to have space for one of his fatal cut three part parried blow draw blood from alleyne 's left shoulder but at the same moment he wound tranter slightly upon the thigh next instant however his blade have slip into the fatal notch there be sharp crack sound with tinkling upon the ground and he find splinter piece of steel fifteen inch long be all that remain to he of his weapon "your life be in my hand cry tranter with bitter smile "nay nay he make submission break in several squire "another sword cry ford "nay sir say harcomb that be not the custom ""throw down your hilt edricson cry norbury "never say alleyne do you crave my pardon sir?""you be mad to ask it ""then on guard again cry the young squire and spring in with fire and fury which more than make up for the shortness of his weapon it have not escape he that his opponent be breathe in short hoarse gasp like man who be dizzy with fatigue now be the time for the purer living and the more agile limb to show their value back and back give tranter ever seek time for last cut on and on come alleyne his jagged point now at his foeman 's face now at his throat now at his chest still stab and thrust to pass the line of steel which cover he yet his experienced foeman know well that such effort could not be long sustain let he relax for one instant and his death blow have come relax he must flesh and blood could not stand the strain already the thrust be less fierce the foot less ready although there be no abatement of the spirit in the steady gray eye tranter cunning and wary from year of fighting know that his chance have come he brush aside the frail weapon which be oppose to he whirl up his great blade spring back to get the fair sweep and vanish into the water of the garonne so intent have the squire both combatant and spectator be on the matter in hand that all thought of the steep bank and swift still stream have go from their mind it be not until tranter give back before the other 's fiery rush be upon the very brink that general cry warn he of his danger that last spring which he hope would have bring the fight to bloody end carry he clear of the edge and he find himself in an instant eight foot deep in the ice cold stream once and twice his gasp face and clutch finger break up through the still green water sweeping outward in the swirl of the current in vain be sword sheath apple branch and belt link together throw out to he by his companion alleyne have drop his shattered sword and be stand tremble in every limb with his rage all change in an instant to pity for the third time the drown man come to the surface his hand full of green slimy water plant his eye turn in despair to the shore their glance fall upon alleyne and he could not withstand the mute appeal which he read in they in an instant he too be in the garonne strike out with powerful stroke for his late foeman yet the current be swift and strong and good swimmer as he be it be no easy task which alleyne have set himself to clutch at tranter and to seize he by the hair be the work of few second but to hold his head above water and to make their way out of the current be another matter for hundred stroke he do not seem to gain an inch then at last amid shout of joy and praise from the bank they slowly draw clear into more stagnant water at the instant that rope make of dozen sword belt link together by the buckle be throw by ford into their very hand three pull from eager arm and the two combatant dripping and pale be drag up the bank and lie pant upon the grass john tranter be the first to come to himself for although he have be long in the water he have do nothing during that fierce battle with the current he stagger to his foot and look down upon his rescuer who have raise himself upon his elbow and be smile faintly at the buzz of congratulation and of praise which break from the squire around he "i be much beholden to you sir say tranter though in no very friendly voice certes should have be in the river now but for you for be bear in warwickshire which be but dry county
