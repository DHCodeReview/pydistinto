then have have the chance to earn the good name and fame which you now bear you do not ride as light as you do oliver and ride light by the weight of my hair but it would be an ill thing if in the evening of our life we show that our heart be less true and loyal than of old if such knight as sir oliver buttesthorn may turn against his own prince for the sake of light word then where be we to look for steadfast faith and constancy?""ah my dear little coz it be easy to sit in the sunshine and preach to the man in the shadow yet you could ever win i over to your side with that soft voice of

epiphany have pommers ready at mid day with my sycamore lance and place my harness on the sumpt mule "with these brief direction the two old soldier stride off together while alleyne hasten to get all in order for their journey it be bright crisp winter 's day when the little party set off from bordeaux on their journey to montaubon where the miss half of their company have last be hear of sir nigel and ford have ride on in advance the knight upon his hackney while his great war horse trot beside his squire two hour later alleyne edricson follow for he have the tavern reckon to settle and many other duty which fall to he as squire of the body with he come aylward and hordle john arm as of old but mount for their journey upon pair of clumsy landes horse heavy headed and shambling but of great endurance and capable of jog along all day even when between the knee of the huge archer who turn the scale at two hundred and seventy pound they take with they the sumpt mule which carry in pannier the wardrobe and table furniture of sir nigel for the knight though neither fop nor epicure be very dainty in small matter and love however bare the board or hard the life that his napery should still be white and his spoon of silver there have be frost during the night and the white hard road ring loud under their horse iron as they spur through the east gate of the town along the same broad highway which the unknown french champion have traverse on the day of the joust the three rode abreast alleyne edricson with his eye cast down and his mind distrait for his thought be busy with the conversation which he have have with sir nigel in the morning have he do well to say so much or have he not do well to have say more what would the knight have say have he confess to his love for the lady maude would he cast he off in disgrace or might he chide he as having abuse the shelter of his roof it have be ready upon his tongue to tell he all when sir oliver have break in upon they perchance sir nigel with his love of all the die usage of chivalry might have contrive some strange ordeal or feat of arm by which his love should be put to the test alleyne smile as he wonder what fantastic and wondrous deed would be exact from he whatever it be he be ready for it whether it be to hold the list in the court of the king of tartary to carry cartel to the sultan of baghdad or to serve term against the wild heathen of prussia sir nigel have say that his birth be high enough for any lady if his fortune could but be amend often have alleyne curl his lip at the beggarly craving for land or for gold which blind man to the high and more lasting issue of life now it seem as though it be only by this same land and gold that he might hope to reach his heart 's desire but then again the socman of minstead be no friend to the constable of twynham castle it might happen that should he amass rich by some happy fortune of war this feud might hold the two family aloof even if maude love he he know she too well to think that she would we he without the blessing of her father dark and murky be it all but hope mount high in youth and it ever flutter over all the turmoil of his thought like white plume amid the shock of horseman if alleyne edricson have enough to ponder over as he ride through the bare plain of guienne his two companion be more busy with the present and less thoughtful of the future aylward ride for half mile with his chin upon his shoulder look back at white kerchief which flutter out of the gable window of high house which peep over the corner of the battlement when at last dip of the road hide it from his view he cock his steel cap shrug his broad shoulder and ride on with laughter in his eye and his weather beat face all ashine with pleasant memory john also ride in silence but his eye wander slowly from one side of the road to the other and he stare and ponder and nod his head like traveller who make his note and save they up for the re tell "by the rood he break out suddenly slap his thigh with his great red hand know that there be something miss but could not bring to my mind what it be ""what be it then ask alleyne come with start out of his reverie "why it be the hedgerow roar john with shout of laughter the country be all scrape as clear as friar 's poll but indeed can not think much of the folk in these part why do they not get to work and dig up these long row of black and crooked stump which see on every hand franklin of hampshire would think shame to have such litter upon his soil ""thou foolish old john quoth aylward you should know well since have hear that the monk of beaulieu could squeeze good cup of wine from their own grape know then that if these row be dig up the wealth of the country would be go and mayhap there would be dry throat and gape mouth in england for in three month time these black root will blossom and shoot and burgeon and from they will come many good ship load of medoc and gascony which will cross the narrow sea but see the church in the hollow and the folk who cluster in the churchyard by my hilt it be burial and there be pass bell he pull off his steel cap as he speak and cross himself with muttered prayer for the repose of the dead "there too remark alleyne as they ride on again that which seem to the eye to be dead be still full of the sap of life even as the vine be thus god hath write himself and his law very broadly on all that be around we if our poor dull eye and duller soul could but read what he hath set before we ""ha mon petit cry the bowman you take i back to the day when you be new fledge as sweet little chick as ever peck his way out of monkish egg have fear that in gain our debonair young man at arm we have lose our soft spoken clerk in truth have note much change in you since we come from twynham castle ""surely it would be strange else see that have live in world so new to i yet trust that there be many thing in which have not change if have turn to serve an earthly master and to carry arm for an earthly king it would be an ill thing if be to lose all thought of the great high king and master of all whose humble and unworthy servant be ere ever leave beaulieu you john be also from the cloister but trow that you do not feel that you have desert the old service in take on the new ""i be slow witted man say john and in sooth when try to think about such matter it cast gloom upon i yet do not look upon myself as bad man in an archer 's jerkin than be in white cowl if that be what you mean ""you have but change from one white company to the other quoth aylward but by these ten finger bone it be pass strange thing to i to think that it be but in the last fall of the leaf that we walk from lyndhurst together he so gentle and maidenly and you john like great red limbe overgrown moon calf and now here you be as sprack squire and as lusty an archer as ever pass down the highway from bordeaux while be still the same old samkin aylward with never change save that have few more sin on my soul and few less crown in my pouch but have never yet hear john what the reason be why you should come out of beaulieu ""there be seven reason say john thoughtfully the first of they be that they throw i out ""ma foi camarade to the devil with the other six that be enough for i and for thee also can see that they be very wise and discreet folk at beaulieu ah mon ange what have you in the pipkin?""it be milk worthy sir answer the peasant maid who stand by the door of cottage with jug in her hand would it please you gentle that should bring you out three horn of it?""nay ma petite but here be two sous piece for thy kindly tongue and for the sight of thy pretty face ma foi but she have bonne mine have mind to bide and speak with she ""nay nay aylward cry alleyne sir nigel will await we and he in haste ""true true camarade adieu ma cherie mon coeur est toujour toi her mother be well grow woman also see where she dig by the wayside ma foi the riper fruit be ever the sweeter bon jour ma belle dame god have you in his keeping say sir nigel where he would await us?""at marmande or aiguillon he say that we could not pass he see that there be but the one road ""aye and it be road that know as know the midhurst parish butts quoth the bowman thirty time have journey it forward and backward and by the twang of string be wo nt to come back this way more laden than go have carry all that have into france in wallet and it hath take four sumpt mule to carry it back again god 's benison on the man who first turn his hand to the making of war but there down in the dingle be the church of cardillac and you may see the inn where three poplar grow beyond the village let we on for stoup of wine would hearten we upon our way "the highway have lain through the swell vineyard country which stretch away to the north and east in gentle curve with many peep spire and feudal tower and cluster of village house all clear cut and hard in the bright wintry air to their right stretch the blue garonne run swiftly seaward with boat and barge dot over its broad bosom on the other side lie strip of vineyard and beyond it the desolate and sandy region of the landes all tangle with faded gorse and heath and broom stretch away in unbroken gloom to the blue hill which lie low upon the furth sky line behind they might still be see the broad estuary of the gironde with the high tower of saint andre and saint remi shoot up from the plain in front amid radiate line of poplar lie the riverside townlet of cardillac gray wall white house and feather of blue smoke "this be the mouton d'or say aylward as they pull up their horse at whitewashed straggling hostel what ho there he continue beat upon the door with the hilt of his sword tapster ostler varlet hark hither and wannion on your lazy limb ha michel as red in the nose as ever three jack of the wine of the country michel for the air bite shrewdly pray you alleyne to take note of this door for have tale concern it ""tell i friend say alleyne to the portly red face inn keeper have knight and squire pass this way within the hour?""nay sir it would be two hour back be he small man weak in the eye with want of hair and speak very quiet when he be most to be feared?""the same the squire answer but marvel how you should know how he speak when he be in wrath for he be very gentle minded with those who be beneath he ""praise to the saint it be not who anger he say the fat michel "who then?""it be young sieur de crespigny of saintonge who chance to be here and make game of the englishman see that he be but small man and hath face which be full of peace but indeed this good knight be very quiet and patient man for he see that the sieur de crespigny be still young and speak from an empty head so he sit his horse and quaff his wine even as you be do now all heedless of the clacking tongue ""and what then michel?""well monsieur it chance that the sieur de crespigny having say this and that for the laughter of the varlet cry out at last about the glove that the knight wear in his coif ask if it be the custom in england for man to wear great archer 's glove in his cap pardieu have never see man get off his horse as quick as do that strange englishman ere the word be past the other 's lip he be beside he his face nigh touching and his breath hot upon his cheek think young sir quoth he softly look into the other 's eye that now that be near you will very clearly see that the glove be not an archer 's glove perchance not say the sieur de crespigny with twitch lip nor be it large but very small quoth the englishman less large than have think say the other look down for the knight 's gaze be heavy upon his eyelid and in every way such glove as might be wear by the fair and sweetest lady in england quoth the englishman it may be so say the sieur de crespigny turn his face from he be myself weak in the eye and have often

god be with you en avant camarade for we have long road before we "at brisk trot the three friend leave cardillac and its wine house behind they ride without halt past st. macaire and on by ferry over the river dorpt at the further side the road wind through la reolle bazaille and marmande with the sunlit river still gleam upon the right and the bare poplar bristle up upon either side john and alleyne ride silent on either side but every inn farm steading or castle bring back to aylward some remembrance of love foray or plunder with which to beguile the way "there be the smoke from bazas on the further side of garonne quoth he there be three sister yonder the daughter of farrier and by these ten finger bone man might ride for long june day and never set eye upon such maiden there be marie tall and grave and blanche petite and gay and the dark agnes with eye that go through you like waxed arrow linger there as long as four day and be betroth to they all for it seem shame to set one above her sister and might make ill blood in the family yet for all my care thing be not merry in the house and think it well to come away there too be the mill of le souris old pierre le caron who own it be right good comrade and have ever seat and crust for weary archer he be man who work hard at all that he turn his hand to but he heat himself in grind bone to mix with his flour and so through over diligence he bring fever upon himself and die ""tell i aylward say alleyne what be amiss with the door of yonder inn that you should ask i to observe it ""pardieu yes have well nigh forgot what see you on yonder door?""i see square hole through which doubtless the host may peep when he be not too sure of those who knock ""and see you naught else?""i mark that beneath this hole
