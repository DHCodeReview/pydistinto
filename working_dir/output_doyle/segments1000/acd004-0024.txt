together with this piece of the true rood from the five and twentieth descendant of joseph of arimathea who still live in jerusalem alive and well though latterly much afflict by boil aye you may well cross yourself and beg that you will not breathe upon it or touch it with your finger ""and the wood and stone holy father ask alleyne with bated breath as he stare awe strike at his precious relic

eager hand the comrade take their new and precious possession and press onwards upon their journey leave the aged palmer still seat under the cherry tree they ride in silence each with his treasure in his hand glance at it from time to time and scarce able to believe that chance have make they sole owner of relic of such holiness and worth that every abbey and church in christendom would have bid eagerly for their possession so they journey full of this good fortune until opposite the town of le mas where john 's horse cast shoe and they be glad to find wayside smith who might set the matter to right to he aylward narrate the good hap which have befall they but the smith when his eye light upon the relic lean up against his anvil and laugh with his hand to his side until the tear hop down his sooty cheek "why master quoth he this man be coquillart or seller of false relic and be here in the smithy not two hour ago this nail that he hath sell you be take from my nail box and as to the wood and the stone you will see heap of both outside from which he hath fill his scrip ""nay nay cry alleyne this be holy man who have journey to jerusalem and acquire dropsy by run from the house of

and drink flask of wine then he beg from i one of my nail and fill his scrip with stone he go upon his way look at these nail and see if they be not the same as that which he have sell you ""now may god save we cry alleyne all aghast be there no end then to the wickedness of humankind he so humble so aged so loth to take our money and yet villain and cheat whom can we trust or believe in?""i will after he say aylward fling himself into the saddle come alleyne we may catch he ere john 's horse be shod "away they gallop together and ere long they see the old gray palmer walk slowly along in front of they he turn however at the sound of their hoofs and it be clear that his blindness be cheat like all the rest of he for he run swiftly through field and so into wood where none could follow he they hurl their relic after he and so ride back to the blacksmith 's the poor both in pocket and in faith it be evening before the three comrade come into aiguillon there they find sir nigel loring and ford safely lodge at the sign of the baton rouge where they sup on good fare and sleep between lavender scented sheet it chance however that knight of poitou sir gaston d'estelle be stay there on his way back from lithuania where he have serve term with the teutonic knight under the land master of the presbytery of marienberg he and sir nigel sit late in high converse as to bushment outfall and the intaking of city with many tale of warlike man and valiant deed then their talk turn to minstrelsy and the strange knight draw forth cittern upon which he play the minne lieder of the north singe the while in high cracked voice of hildebrand and brunhild and siegfried and all the strength and beauty of the land of almain to this sir nigel answer with the romance of sir eglamour and of sir isumbras and so through the long winter night they sit by the crackle wood fire answer each other 's song until the crowing cock join in their concert yet with scarce an hour of rest sir nigel be as blithe and bright as ever as they set forth after breakfast upon their way "this sir gaston be very worthy man say he to his squire as they ride from the baton rouge he hath very strong desire to advance himself and would have enter upon some small knightly debate with i have he not chance to have his arm bone break by the kick of horse have conceive great love for he and have promise he that when his bone be mend will exchange thrust with he but we must keep to this road upon the left ""nay my fair lord quoth aylward the road to montaubon be over the river and so through quercy and the agenois ""true my good aylward but have learn from this worthy knight who hath come over the french marche that there be company of englishman who be burn and plunder in the country round villefranche have little doubt from what he say that they be those whom we seek ""by my hilt it be like enough say aylward by all account they have be so long at montaubon that there would be little there worth the taking then as they have already be in the south they would come north to the country of the aveyron ""we shall follow the lot until we come to cahors and then cross the marche into villefranche say sir nigel by st. paul as we be but small band it be very likely that we may have some very honorable and pleasing adventure for hear that there be little peace upon the french border "all morning they ride down broad and wind road bar with the shadow of poplar sir nigel ride in front with his squire while the two archer follow behind with the sumpt mule between they they have leave aiguillon and the garonne far to the south and ride now by the tranquil lot which curve blue and placid through gently rolling country alleyne could not but mark that whereas in guienne there have be many townlet and few castle there be now many castle and few house on either hand gray wall and square grim keep peep out at every few mile from amid the forest while the few village which they pass be all ring round with rude wall which speak of the constant fear and sudden foray of wild frontier land twice during the morning there come band of horseman swoop down upon they from the black gateway of wayside stronghold with short stern question as to whence they come and what their errand band of armed man clank along the highway and the few line of laden mule which carry the merchandise of the trader be guard by armed varlet or by archer hire for the service "the peace of bretigny hath not make much change in these part quoth sir nigel for the country be overrun with free companion and masterless man yonder tower between the wood and the hill mark the town of cahors and beyond it be the land of france but here be man by the wayside and as he hath two horse and squire make little doubt that he be knight pray you alleyne to give he greet from i and to ask he for his title and coat armor it may be that can relieve he of some vow or perchance he hath lady whom he would wish to advance ""nay my fair lord say alleyne these be not horse and squire but mule and varlet the man be mercer for he hath great bundle beside he ""now god 's blessing on your honest english voice cry the stranger prick up his ear at the sound of alleyne 's word never have hear music that be so sweet to mine ear come watkin lad throw the bale over laura 's back my heart be nigh broke for it seem that have leave all that be english behind i and that would never set eye upon norwich market square again he be tall lusty middle aged man with ruddy face brown fork beard shoot with gray and broad flander hat set at the back of his head his servant as tall as himself but gaunt and raw boned have swing the bale on the back of one mule while the merchant mount upon the other and ride to join the party it be easy to see as he approach from the quality of his dress and the richness of his trapping that he be man of some wealth and position "sir knight say he my name be david micheldene and be burgher and alderman of the good town of norwich where live five door from the church of our lady as all man know on the bank of yare have here my bale of cloth which carry to cahors woe worth the day that ever start on such an errand crave your gracious protection upon the way for i my servant and my mercery for have already have many perilous passage and have now learn that roger club foot the robber knight of quercy be out upon the road in front of i hereby agree to give you one rise noble if you bring i safe to the inn of the angel in cahors the same to be repay to i or my heir if any harm come to i or my good ""by saint paul answer sir nigel should be sorry knight if ask pay for stand by countryman in strange land you may ride with i and welcome master micheldene and your varlet may follow with my archer ""god 's benison upon thy bounty cry the stranger should you come to norwich you may have cause to remember that you have be of service to alderman micheldene it be not very far to cahors for surely see the cathedral tower against the sky line but have hear much of this roger clubfoot and the more hear the less do wish to look upon his face oh but be sick and weary of it all and would give half that be worth to see my good dame sit in peace beside i and to hear the bell of norwich town ""your word be strange to i quoth sir nigel for you have the appearance of stout man and see that you wear sword by your side ""yet it be not my trade answer the merchant doubt not that if set you down in my shop at norwich you might scarce tell fustian from falding and know little difference between the velvet of genoa and the three pile cloth of bruge there you might well turn to i for help but here on lone roadside with thick wood and robber knight turn to you for it be the business to which you have be rear ""there be sooth in what you say master micheldene say sir nigel and trust that we may come upon this roger clubfoot for have hear that he be very stout and skilful soldier and man from whom much honor be to be gain ""he be bloody robber say the trader curtly and wish see he kick at the end of halter ""it be such man as he sir nigel remark who give the true knight honorable deed to do whereby he may advance himself ""it be such man as he retort micheldene who be like rat in wheat rick or moth in woolfel harm and hindrance to all peaceful and honest man ""yet if the danger of the road weigh so heavily upon you master alderman it be great marvel to i that you should venture so far from home ""and sometimes sir knight it be marvel to myself but be man who may grutch and grumble but when have set my face to do thing will not turn my back upon it until it be do there be one francois villet at cahors who will send i wine cask for my cloth bale so to cahor will go though all the robber knight of christendom be to line the road like yonder poplar ""stoutly speak master alderman but how have you fare hitherto?""as lamb fare in land of wolf five time we have have to beg and pray ere we could pass twice have pay toll to the warden of the road three time we have have to draw and once at la reolle we stand over our wool bale watkin and and we lay about we for as long as man might chant litany slay one rogue and wound two other by god 's coif we be man of peace but we be free english burgher not to be mishandle either in our country or abroad neither lord baron knight or commoner shall have as much as strike of flax of mine whilst have strength to wag this sword ""and pass strange sword it be quoth sir nigel what make you alleyne of these black line which be draw across the sheath?""i can not tell what they be my fair lord ""nor can say ford the merchant chuckle to himself it be thought of mine own say he for the sword be make by thomas wilson the armorer who be betroth to my second daughter margery know then that the sheath be one cloth yard in length mark off accord to foot and inch to serve i as measure wand it be also of the exact weight of two pound so that may use it in the balance ""by saint paul quoth sir nigel it be very clear to i that the sword be like thyself good alderman apt either for war or for peace but doubt not that even in england you have have much to suffer from the hand of robber and outlaw ""it be only last lammastide sir knight that be leave for dead near read as journey to winchester fair yet have the rogue up at the court of pie powder and they will harm no more peaceful trader ""you travel much then!""to winchester linn mart bristol fair stourbridge and bartholomew be in london town the rest of the year you may ever find i five door from the church of our lady where would from my heart that be at this moment for there be no air like norwich air and no water like the yare nor can all the wine of france compare with the beer of old sam yelverton who keep the dun cow but out and alack here be an evil fruit which hang upon this chestnut tree!"as he speak they have ride round curve of
