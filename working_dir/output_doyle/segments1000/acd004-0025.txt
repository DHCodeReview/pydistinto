cursing clerk with it the latter unable to escape from the shower of blow set spur to his mule and ride for his life with his enemy thunder behind he at sight of his master 's sudden departure the varlet watkin set off after he with the pack mule beside he so that the four clatter away down the road together until they sweep round curve and their babble be but drone in the distance sir nigel and alleyne gaze in astonishment at one another while ford burst out laugh "pardieu say the knight this david micheldene must be one of those lollards about whom father christopher of the priory have so much to say yet he seem to be no bad man from what have see of he ""i have hear that wicliff hath many follower in norwich answer alleyne "by st. paul have no great love for they quoth sir nigel be man who be slow to change and if you take away from i the faith that have be teach it would be long ere could learn one to set in its place it be but chip here and chip there yet it may bring the tree

so long as can keep the path of honor be well content my creed shall ever be that of chandos fais ce que dois adviegne que peut c'est commande au chevalier "after pass cahor the party branch away from the main road and leave the river to the north of they follow small track which wind over vast and desolate plain this path lead they amid marsh and wood until it bring they out into glade with broad stream swirl swiftly down the centre of it through this the horse splash their way and on the farther shore sir nigel announce to they that they be now within the border of the land of france for some mile they still follow the same lonely track which lead they through dense wood and then widen out curve down to an open rolling country such as they have traverse between aiguillon and cahors if it be grim and desolate upon the english border however what can describe the hideous barrenness of this ten time harry tract of france the whole face of the country be scarred and disfigure mottle over with the black blotch of burn farm steading and the gray gaunt gable end of what have be chateaux broken fence crumble wall vineyard litter with stone the shatter arch of bridge look where you might the sign of ruin and rapine meet the eye here and there only on the farth sky line the gnarl turret of castle or the graceful pinnacle of church or of monastery show where the force of the sword or of the spirit have preserve some small islet of security in this universal flood of misery moodily and in silence the little party ride along the narrow and irregular track their heart weigh down by this far stretch land of despair it be indeed stricken and blighted country and man might have ride from auvergne in the north to the marche of foix nor ever see smile village or thriving homestead from time to time as they advance they see strange lean figure scrape and scratch amid the weed and thistle who on sight of the band of horseman throw up their arm and dive in among the brushwood as shy and as swift as wild animal more than once however they come on family by the wayside who be too weak from hunger and disease to fly so that they could but sit like hare on tussock with pant chest and terror in their eye so gaunt be these poor folk so worn and spend with bent and knotted frame and sullen hopeless mutinous face that it make the young englishman heart sick to look upon they indeed it seem as though all hope and light have go so far from they that it be not to be bring back for when sir nigel throw down handful of silver among they there come no softening of their line face but they clutch greedily at the coin peer questioningly at he and champ with their animal jaw here and there amid the brushwood the traveller see the rude bundle of stick which serve they as home more like fowl 's nest than the dwelling place of man yet why should they build and strive when the first adventurer who pass would set torch to their thatch and when their own feudal lord would wring from they with blow and curse the last fruit of their toil they sit at the low depth of human misery and hug bitter comfort to their soul as they realize that they could go no lower yet they have still the human gift of speech and would take council among themselves in their brushwood hovel glare with blear eye and point with thin finger at the great widespread chateaux which eat like cancer into the life of the country side when such man who be beyond hope and fear begin in their dim mind to see the source of their woe it may be an evil time for those who have wrong they the weak man become strong when he have nothing for then only can he feel the wild mad thrill of despair high and strong the chateaux lowly and weak the brushwood hut but god help the seigneur and his lady when the man of the brushwood set their hand to the work of revenge!through such country do the party ride for eight or it might be nine mile until the sun begin to slope down in the west and their shadow to stream down the road in front of they wary and careful they must be with watchful eye to the right and the left for this be no man 's land and their only passport be those which hang from their belt frenchmen and englishmen gascon and provencal brabanter tardvenu scorcher flayer and free companion wander and struggle over the whole of this accurse district so bare and cheerless be the outlook and so few and poor the dwelling that sir nigel begin to have fear as to whether he might find food and quarter for his little troop it be relief to he therefore when their narrow track open out upon large road and they see some little way down it square white house with great bunch of holly hang out at the end of stick from one of the upper window "by st. paul say he be right glad for have fear that we might have neither provant nor herbergage ride on alleyne and tell this inn keeper that an english knight with his party will lodge with he this night "alleyne set spur to his horse and reach the inn door long bow shot before his companion neither varlet nor ostler could be see so he push open the door and call loudly for the landlord three time he shout but receive no reply he open an inner door and advance into the chief guest room of the hostel very cheerful wood fire be sputtering and crack in an open grate at the further end of the apartment at one side of this fire in high back oak chair sit lady her face turn towards the door the firelight play over her feature and alleyne think that he have never see such queenly power such dignity and strength upon woman 's face she might have be five and thirty year of age with aquiline nose firm yet sensitive mouth dark curve brow and deep set eye which shine and sparkle with shift brilliancy beautiful as she be it be not her beauty which impress itself upon the beholder it be her strength her power the sense of wisdom which hang over the broad white brow the decision which lie in the square jaw and delicately moulded chin chaplet of pearl sparkle amid her black hair with gauze of silver network flow back from it over her shoulder black mantle be swathe round she and she lean back in her chair as one who be fresh from journey in the opposite corner there sit very burly and broad shoulder man clothe in black jerkin trim with sable with black velvet cap with curl white feather cock upon the side of his head flask of red wine stand at his elbow and he seem to be very much at his ease for his foot be stick up on stool and between his thigh he hold dish full of nut these he crack between his strong white tooth and chew in leisurely way cast the shell into the blaze as alleyne gaze in at he he turn his face half round and cock an eye at he over his shoulder it seem to the young englishman that he have never see so hideous face for the eye be of the light green the nose be break and drive inward while the whole countenance be sear and pucker with wound the voice too when he speak be as deep and as fierce as the growl of beast of prey "young man say he know not who you may be and be not much inclined to bestir myself but if it be not that be bent upon take my ease swear by the sword of joshua that would lay my dog whip across your shoulder for dare to fill the air with these discordant bellowing "taken aback at this ungentle speech and scarce know how to answer it fitly in the presence of the lady alleyne stand with his hand upon the handle of the door while sir nigel and his companion dismount at the sound of these fresh voice and of the tongue in which they speak the stranger crash his dish of nut down upon the floor and begin himself to call for the landlord until the whole house re echo with his roaring with an ashen face the white aproned host come run at his call his hand shake and his very hair bristle with apprehension for the sake of god sir he whisper as he pass speak he fair and do not rouse he for the love of the virgin be mild with him!""who be this then ask sir nigel alleyne be about to explain when fresh roar from the stranger interrupt he "thou villain inn keeper he shout do not ask you when bring my lady here whether your inn be clean?""you do sire ""did not very particularly ask you whether there be any vermin in it?""you do sire ""and you answer me?""that there be not sire ""and yet ere have be here an hour find englishman crawl about within it where be

the bad for they and for you ""i will sire will cry the frightened host and bustle from the room while the soft soothe voice of the woman be hear remonstrate with her furious companion "indeed gentleman you have well go say mine host it be but six mile to villefranche where there be very good quarter at the sign of the lion rouge '""nay answer sir nigel can not go until have see more of this person for he appear to be man from whom much be to be hope what be his name and title?""it be not for my lip to name it unless by his desire but beg and pray you gentleman that you will go from my house for know not what may come of it if his rage should gain the mastery of he ""by saint paul lisp sir nigel this be certainly man whom it be worth journey far to know go tell he that humble knight of england would make his far honorable acquaintance not from any presumption pride or ill will but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our lady give he greet from sir nigel loring and say that the glove which bear in my cap belong to the most peerless and lovely of her sex whom be now ready to uphold against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advance "the landlord be hesitate whether to carry this message or no when the door of the inner room be fling open and the stranger bound out like panther from its den his hair bristle and his deform face convulse with anger "still here he snarl dogs of england must ye be lash hence tiphaine my sword he turn to seize his weapon but as he do so his gaze fall upon the blazonry of sir nigel 's shield and he stand stare while the fire in his strange green eye soften into sly and humorous twinkle "mort dieu cry he it be my little swordsman of bordeaux should remember that coat armor see that it be but three day since look upon it in the list by garonne ah sir nigel sir nigel you owe i return for this and he touch his right arm which be girt round just under the shoulder with silken kerchief but the surprise of the stranger at the sight of sir nigel be as nothing compare with the astonishment and the delight which shine upon the face of the knight of hampshire as he look upon the strange face of the frenchman
