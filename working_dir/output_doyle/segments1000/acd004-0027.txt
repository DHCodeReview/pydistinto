the window and gaze out at the moonlit landscape his mind absorb by the thought of the lady tiphaine and of the strange word that she have speak as to what be go forward at castle twynham lean his elbow upon the stonework he be deeply plunge in reverie when in moment his thought be bring back to villefranche and to the scene before he the window at which he stand be in the second floor of that portion of the castle which be nearest to the keep in front lie the broad moat with the moon lie upon its surface now clear and round now draw lengthwise as the breeze stir the water beyond the plain slope down to thick wood while far to the left second wood shut out the view between the two an open glade stretch silver in the moonshine with the river curve across the low end of it as he gaze he see of sudden man steal forth from the wood into the open clearing he walk with his head sink his shoulder curve and his knee bent as one who strive hard to remain unseen ten pace from the fringe of tree he glance around and wave his hand he crouch down and be lose to sight among belt of furze bush after he there come second man and after he third fourth and fifth stealing across the narrow open space and dart into the shelter of the brushwood nine and seventy alleyne count of these dark figure flit across the line of the moonlight many bore huge burden upon their back though what it be that they carry he could not tell at the distance out of the one wood and into the other they pass all with the same crouching furtive gait until the black bristle of tree have swallow up the last of they for moment alleyne stand in the window still stare down at the silent forest uncertain as to what he should think of these midnight walker then he bethink he that there be one beside he who be fitter to judge on such matter his finger have scarce rest upon aylward 's shoulder ere the bowman be on his foot with his hand outstretche to his sword "qui va he cry hola mon petit by my hilt think there have be camisade what then mon gar.?""come hither by the window aylward say alleyne have see four score man pass from yonder shaw across the glade and nigh every man of they have great burden on his back what think you of it?""i think nothing of it mon camarade there be as many masterless folk in this country as there be rabbit on cowdray down and there be many who show their face by night but would dance in hempen collar if they stir forth in the day on all the french marche be drove of outcast reiver spoiler and draw latch of whom judge that these be some though marvel that they should dare to come so nigh to the castle of the seneschal all seem very quiet now he add peer out of the window "they be in the further wood say alleyne "and there they may bide back to rest mon petit for by my hilt each day now will bring its own work yet it would be well to shoot the bolt in yonder door when one be in strange quarter so he throw himself down upon his pallet and in an instant be fast asleep it might have be about three o'clock in the morning when alleyne be arouse from troubled sleep by low cry or exclamation he listen but as he hear no more he set it down as the challenge of the guard upon the wall and drop off to sleep once more few minute later he be disturb by gentle creaking of his own door as though some one be push cautiously against it and immediately afterwards he hear the soft thud of cautious footstep upon the stair which lead to the room above follow by confused noise and muffled groan alleyne sit up on his couch with all his nerve in tingle uncertain whether these sound might come from simple cause some sick archer and visit leech perhaps or whether they might have more sinister meaning but what danger could threaten they here in this strong castle under the care of famous warrior with high wall and broad moat around they who be there that could injure they he have well nigh persuade himself that his fear be foolish fancy when his eye fall upon that which send the blood cold to his heart and leave he gasp with hand clutch at the counterpane right in front of he be the broad window of the chamber with the moon shine brightly through it for an instant something have obscure the light and now head be bob up and down outside the face look in at he and swinge slowly from one side of the window to the other even in that dim light there could be no mistaking those feature draw distorted and blood stain they be still those of the young fellow squire who have sit so recently upon his own couch with cry of horror alleyne spring from his bed and rush to the casement while the two archer arouse by the sound seize their weapon and stare about they in bewilderment one glance be enough to show edricson that his fear be but too true foully murder with score of wound upon he and rope round his neck his poor friend have be cast from the upper window and swing slowly in the night wind his body rasp against the wall and his disfigure face upon level with the casement "my god cry alleyne shake in every limb what have come upon we what devil 's deed be this?""here be flint and steel say john stolidly the lamp aylward this moonshine soften man 's heart now we may use the eye which god hath give we ""by my hilt cry aylward as the yellow flame flicker up it be indeed young master ford and think that this seneschal be black villain who dare not face we in the day but would murther we in our sleep by the twang of string if do not soak goose 's feather with his heart 's blood it will be no fault of samkin aylward of the white company ""but aylward think of the man whom see yesternight say alleyne it may not be the seneschal it may be that other have come into the castle must to sir nigel ere it be too late let i go aylward for my place be by his side ""one moment mon gar put that steel head piece on the end of my yew stave so will put it first through the door for it be ill to come out when you can neither see nor guard yourself now camarade out sword and stand ready hola by my hilt it be time that we be stirring!"a he speak sudden shouting break forth in the castle with the scream of woman and the rush of many foot then come the sharp clink of clash steel and roar like that of an angry lion notre dame du guesclin st. ives st. ives the bow man pull back the bolt of the door and thrust out the headpiece at the end of the bow clash the clatter of the steel cap upon the ground and ere the man who strike could heave up for another blow the archer have pass his sword through his body on camarade on he cry and break fiercely past two man who throw themselves in his way he speed down the broad corridor in the direction of the shouting sharp turning and then second one bring they to the head of short stair from which they look straight down upon the scene of the uproar square oak floor hall lie beneath they from which open the door of the principal guest chamber this hall be as light as day for torch burn in numerous sconce upon the wall throw strange shadow from the tusked or antlere head which ornament they at the very foot of the stair close to the open door of their chamber

the pit than man of flesh and blood even as he look they break into hoarse yell and dash once more upon the two knight hurl themselves madly upon their sword point clutch scrambling biting tear careless of wound if they could but drag the two soldier to earth sir nigel be throw down by the sheer weight of they and sir bertrand with his thunderous war cry be swinge round his heavy sword to clear space for he to rise when the whistle of two long english arrow and the rush of the squire and the two english archer down the stair turn the tide of the combat the assailant give back the knight rush forward and in very few moment the hall be clear and hordle john have hurl the last of the wild man down the steep step which lead from the end of it "do not follow they cry du guesclin we
