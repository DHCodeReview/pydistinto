across the bowstave be fasten to their leathern shoulder belt by hook in the centre of the handle sir nigel 's heart beat high as he look upon their free bearing and fearless face for two hour they march through forest and marshland along the left bank of the river aveyron sir nigel ride behind his company with alleyne at his right hand and johnston the old master bowman walk by his left stirrup ere they have reach their journey 's end the knight have learn all that he would know of his man their doing and their intention once as they march they see upon the further bank of the river body of

there be no ford near than tourville answer the old archer he be on his way to villefranche and short will be the shrift of any jacks who come into his hand for he be man of short speech it be he and the seneschal of beaucaire who hang peter wilkins of the company last lammastide for which by the black rood of waltham they shall hang themselves if ever they come into our power but here be our comrade sir nigel and here be our camp "as he speak the forest pathway along which they march open out into green glade which slope down towards the river high leafless tree girt it in on three side

nigel they will not be lead by any save their own blood and race there be no persuade they not even claude latour seigneur of montchateau master of the high justice the middle and the low could gain their favor they must needs hold council and put their two hundred thick head together and then there come this fellow aylward and another as their spokesman to say that they will disband unless an englishman of good name be set over they there be many of they as understand who come from some great forest which lie in hampi or hampti can not lay my tongue to the name your dwelling be in those part and so their thought turn to you as their leader but we have hope that you would bring hundred man with you ""they be already at dax where we shall join they say sir nigel but let the man break their fast and we shall then take counsel what to do ""come into my hut say sir claude it be but poor fare that can lay before you milk cheese wine and bacon yet your squire and yourself will doubtless excuse it this be my house where the pennon fly before the door small residence to contain the lord of montchateau "sir nigel sit silent and distrait at his meal while alleyne hearken to the clattering tongue of the gascon and to his talk of the glory of his own estate his success in love and his triumph in war "and now that you be here sir nigel he say at last have many fine venture all ready for we have hear that montpezat be of no great strength and that there be two hundred thousand crown in the castle at castelnau also there be cobbler who be in my pay and who will throw we rope any dark night from his house by the town wall promise you that you shall thrust your arm elbow deep among good silver piece ere the night be moonless again for on every hand of we be fair woman rich wine and good plunder as much as heart could wish ""i have other plan answer sir nigel curtly for have come hither to lead these bowman to the help of the prince our master who may have sore need of they ere he set pedro upon the throne of spain it be my purpose to start this very day for dax upon the adour where he hath now pitch his camp "the face of the gascon darken and his eye flash with resentment for i he say care little for this war and find the life which lead very joyous and pleasant one will not go to dax ""nay think again sir claude say sir nigel gently for you have ever have the name of true and loyal knight surely you will not hold back now when your master hath need of you ""i will not go to dax the other shout "but your devoir your oath of fealty?""i say that will not go ""then sir claude must lead the company without you ""if they will follow cry the gascon with sneer these be not hire slave but free companion who will do nothing save by their own good will in very sooth my lord loring they be ill man to trifle with and it be easy to pluck bone from hungry bear than to lead bowman out of land of plenty and of pleasure ""then pray you to gather they together say sir nigel and will tell they what be in my mind for if be their leader they must to dax and if be not then know not what be do in auvergne have my horse ready alleyne for by st. paul come what may must be upon the homeward road ere mid day "a blast upon the bugle summon the bowman to counsel and they gather in little knot and group around great fall tree which lie athwart the glade sir nigel spring lightly upon the trunk and stand with blink eye and firm lip look down at the ring of upturned warlike face "they tell i bowman say he that ye have grow so fond of ease and plunder and high living that ye be not to be move from this pleasant country but by saint paul will believe no such thing of you for can readily see that you be all very valiant man who would scorn to live here in peace when your prince hath so great venture before he ye have choose i as leader and leader will be if ye come with i to spain and vow to you that my pennon of the five rose shall if god give i strength and life be ever where there be most honor to be gain but if it be your wish to loll and loiter in these glade barter glory and renown for vile gold and ill get rich then ye must find another leader for have live in honor and in honor trust that shall die if there be forest man or hampshire man amongst ye call upon they to say whether they will follow the banner of loring ""here be romsey man for you cry young bowman with sprig of evergreen set in his helmet "and lad from alresford shout another "and from milton!""and from burley!""and from lymington!""and little one from brockenhurst shout huge limbe fellow who sprawl beneath tree "by my hilt lad cry aylward jump upon the fallen trunk think that we could not look the girl in the eye if we let the prince cross the mountain and do not pull string to clear path for he it be very well in time of peace to lead such life as we have have together but now the war banner be in the wind once more and by these ten finger bone if he go alone old samkin aylward will walk beside it "these word from man as popular as aylward decide many of the waverer and shout of approval burst from his audience "far be it from i say sir claude latour suavely to persuade you against this worthy archer or against sir nigel loring yet we have be together in many venture and perchance it may not be amiss if say to you what think upon the matter ""peace for the little gascon cry the archer let every man have his word shoot straight for the mark lad and fair play for all ""bethink you then say sir claude that you go under hard rule with neither freedom nor pleasure and for what for sixpence day at the most while now you may walk across the country and stretch out either hand to gather in whatever you have mind for what do we not hear of our comrade who have go with sir john hawkwood to italy in one night they have hold to ransom six hundred of the rich nobleman of mantua they camp before great city and the base burgher come forth with the key and then they make great spoil or if it please they well they take so many horse load of silver as composition and so they journey on from state to state rich and free and fear by all now be not that the proper life for soldier?""the proper life for robber roar hordle john in his thunder voice "and yet there be much in what the gascon say say swarthy fellow in weather stain doublet and for one would rather prosper in italy than starve in spain ""you be always cur and traitor mark shaw cry aylward by my hilt if you will stand forth and draw your sword will warrant you that you will see neither one nor the other ""nay aylward say sir nigel we can not mend the matter by broil sir claude think that what you have say do you little honor and if my word aggrieve you be ever ready to go deeply into the matter with you but you shall have such man as will follow you and you may go where you will so that you come not with we let all who love their prince and country stand fast while those who think more of well line purse step forth upon the farther side "thirteen bowman with hung head and sheepish face step forward with mark shaw and range themselves behind sir claude amid the hooting and hissing of their comrade they march off together to the gascon 's hut while the main body break up their meeting and set cheerily to work pack their possession furbish their weapon and prepare for the march which lie before they over the tarn and the garonne through the vast quagmire of armagnac past the swift flow losse and so down the long valley of the adour there be many long league to be cross ere they could join themselves to that dark war cloud which be drift slowly southward to the line of the snowy peak beyond which the banner of england have never yet be see the whole vast plain of gascony and of languedoc be an arid and profitless expanse in winter save where the swift flow adour and her snow feed tributary the louts the oloron and the pau run down to the sea of biscay south of the adour the jagged line of mountain which fringe the sky line send out long granite claws run down into the lowland and divide they into gave or stretch of valley hillock grow into hill and hill into mountain each range overlie its neighbor until they soar up in the giant chain which raise its spotless and untrodden peak white and dazzling against the pale blue wintry sky quiet land be this land where the slow move basque with his flat biretta cap his red sash and his hempen sandal till his scanty farm or drive his lean flock to their hill side pasture it be the country of the wolf and the isard of the brown bear and the mountain goat land of bare rock and of rush water yet here it be that the will of great prince have now assemble gallant army so that from the adour to the pass of navarre the barren valley and wind sweep waste be populous with soldier and loud with the shouting of order and the neighing of horse for the banner of war have be fling to

above all an heir to the throne have be bear in bordeaux and the prince might leave his spouse with an easy mind for all be well with mother and with child the key of the mountain pass still lie in the hand of the shifty and ignoble charles of navarre who have chaffer and bargain both with the english and with the spanish take money from the one side to hold they open and from the other to keep they seal the mallet hand of edward however have shatter all the scheme and wile of the plotter neither entreaty nor courtly remonstrance come from the english prince but sir hugh calverley pass silently over the border with his company and the blaze wall of the two city of miranda and puenta de la reyna warn the unfaithful monarch that there be other metal besides gold and that he be deal with man to whom it be unsafe to lie his price be pay his objection silence and the mountain gorge lay open to the invader from the feast of the epiphany there be muster and massing until in the first

spear proud and happy man be the knight and many time he turn in his saddle to look at the long column of bowman who swing swiftly along behind he "by saint paul alleyne say he this pass be very perilous place and would that the king of navarre have hold it against we for it would have be very honorable venture have it fall to we to win passage have hear the minstrel sing of one sir roland
