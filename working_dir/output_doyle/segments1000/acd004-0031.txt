village here on the contrary be nothing but naked rock poor pasture and savage stone strew waste gloomy defile or barranca intersect this wild country with mountain torrent dash and foam between their rugged side the clatter of water the scream of the eagle and the howling of wolf the only sound which break upon the silence in that dreary and inhospitable region through this wild country it be that sir nigel and his company push their way ride at time through vast defile where the brown gnarl cliff shoot up on either side of they and the sky be but long winding blue slit between the clustering line of box which fringe the lip of the precipice or again lead their horse along the narrow and rocky path wear by the muleteer upon the edge of the chasm where under their very elbow they could see the white streak which mark thegavewhich foam thousand foot below they so for two day they push their way through the wild place of navarre past fuente over the rapid ega through estella until upon

must see more of these spaniards ere turn ""i will not leave you sir william return sir simon burley and yet as an old soldier and one who hath see much of war can not but think that it be an ill thing for four hundred man to find themselves between an army of sixty thousand on the one side and broad river on the other ""yet say sir richard causton we can not for the honor of england go back

back of we for the prince hath now advanced to salvatierra and thence to vittoria so that if we come upon their camp from the further side we can make good our retreat ""what then would you propose ask sir simon shake his grizzle head as one who be but half convinced "that we ride forward ere the news reach they that we have cross the river in this way we may have sight of their army and perchance even find occasion for some small deed against they ""so be it then say sir simon burley and the rest of the council having approve scanty meal be hurriedly snatch and the advance resume under the cover of the darkness all night they lead their horse stumble and grope through wild defile and rugged valley follow the guidance of frightened peasant who be strap by the wrist to black simon 's stirrup leather with the early dawn they find themselves in black ravine with other slope away from it on either side and the bare brown crag rise in long bleak terrace all round they "if it please you fair lord say black simon this man hath mislead we and since there be no tree upon which we may hang he it might be well to hurl he over yonder cliff "the peasant read the soldier 's meaning in his fierce eye and harsh accent drop upon his knee scream loudly for mercy "how come it dog ask sir william felton in spanish where be this camp to which you swear that you would lead us?""by the sweet virgin by the bless mother of god cry the tremble peasant swear to you that in the darkness have myself lose the path ""over the cliff with he shout half dozen voice but ere the archer could drag he from the rock to which he cling sir nigel have ride up and call upon they to stop "how be this sir say he as long as the prince doth i the honor to entrust this venture to i it be for i only to give order and by saint paul shall be right blithe to go very deeply into the matter with any one to whom my word may give offence how say you sir william or you my lord of angus or you sir richard?""nay nay nigel cry sir william this base peasant be too small matter for old comrade to quarrel over but he hath betray we and certe he hath merit dog 's death ""hark ye fellow say sir

say our morning orison and it may chance that ere we finish he may strike upon the track "with bow head and steel cap in hand the archer stand at their horse 's head while sir simon burley repeat the pater the ave and the credo long do alleyne bear the scene in mind the knot of knight in their dull leaden hue armor the ruddy visage of sir oliver the craggy feature of the scottish earl the shine scalp of sir nigel with the dense ring of hard bearded face and the long brown head of the horse all top and circle by the beetling cliff scarce have the last deep amen break from the company when in an instant there rise the scream of hundred bugle with the deep rolling of drum and the clashing of cymbal all sound together in one deafening uproar knight and archer spring to arm convince that some great host be upon they but the guide drop upon his knee and thank heaven for its mercy "we have find they caballero he cry this be their morning call if ye will but deign to follow i will set they before you ere man might tell his bead "as he speak he scramble down one of the narrow ravine and climb over low ridge at the further end he lead they into short valley with stream purl down the centre of it and very thick growth of elder and of box upon either side push their way through the dense brushwood they look out upon scene which make their heart beat hard and their breath come fast

all this vast meadow there lie great city of tent thousand upon thousand of they lay out in street and in square like well order town high silken pavilion or colored marquee shoot up from among the crowd of meaner dwelling mark where the great lord and baron of leon and castile display their standard while over the white roof as far as eye could reach the waving of ancient pavon pensil and banderole with flash of gold and glow of color proclaim that all the chivalry of iberia be muster in the plain beneath they far off in the centre of the camp huge palace of red and white silk with the royal arm of castile waive from the summit announce that the gallant henry lie there in the midst of his warrior as the english adventurer peep out from behind their brushwood screen look down upon this wondrous sight they could see that the vast army in front of they be already afoot the first pink light of the rise sun glitter upon the steel cap and breastplate of dense masse of slinger and of crossbowman who drill and march in the space which have be leave for their exercise thousand column of smoke reek up into the pure morning air where the faggot be pile and the camp kettle already simmer in the open plain cloud of light horse gallop and swoop with sway body and wave javelin after the fashion which the spanish have adopt from their moorish enemy all along by the sedgy bank of the river long line of page lead their master charger down to water while the knight themselves lounge in gayly dress group about the door of their pavilion or ride out with their falcon upon their wrist and their greyhound behind they in quest of quail or of leveret "by my hilt mon gar whisper aylward to alleyne as the young squire stand with parted lip and wonder eye gaze down at the novel scene before he we have be seek they all night but now that we have find they know not what we be to do with they ""you say sooth samkin quoth old johnston would that we be upon the far side of ebro

save for muttered jest or whisper order for twice during the long morning they hear bugle call from amid the hill on either side of they which show that they have thrust themselves in between the outpost of the enemy the leader sit amongst the box wood and take counsel together as to what they should do while from below there surge up the buzz of voice the shouting the neighing of horse and all the uproar of great camp "what boot it to wait say sir william felton let we ride down upon their camp ere they discover we ""and so say cry the scottish earl for they do not know that there be any enemy within thirty long league of they ""for my part say sir simon burley think that it be madness for you can not hope to rout this great army and where be you to go and what be you to do when

help of god may be able to draw off again which as sir simon burley hath say would be scarce possible in any other way ""how then sir nigel ask several voice "we shall lie here all day for amid this brushwood it be ill for they to see we then when evening come we shall sally out upon they and see if we may not gain some honorable advancement from they ""but why then rather than now?""because we shall have nightfall to cover we when we draw off so that we may make our way back through the mountain would station score of archer here in the pass with all our pennon jut forth from the rock and as many nakir and drum and bugle as we have with we so that those who follow we in the fade light may think that the whole army of the prince be upon they and fear to go far what think you of my plan
