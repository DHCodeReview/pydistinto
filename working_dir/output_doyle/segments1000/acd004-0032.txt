and dark face cavalier mount upon white horse burst through the bush and ride swiftly down the valley from the end which be farth from the spanish camp lightly armed with his vizor open and hawk perch upon his left wrist he look about he with the careless air of man who be bent wholly upon pleasure and unconscious of the possibility of danger suddenly however his eye light upon the fierce face which glare out at he from the brushwood with cry of terror he thrust his spur into his horse 's side and dash for the narrow opening of the gorge for moment it seem as though he would have reach it for he have trample over or dash aside the archer who throw themselves in his way but hordle john seize he by the foot in his grasp of iron and drag he from the saddle while two other catch the frightened horse "ho ho roar the great archer how many cow wilt buy my mother if set thee free?""hush that bull 's bellowing cry sir nigel impatiently bring the man here by st. paul it be not the

end of the pass for it may happen that some other cavalier may visit we ere the time be come all day the little band of englishmen lie in the sheltered gorge look down upon the vast host of their unconscious enemy shortly after mid day great uproar of shout and cheering break out in the camp with mustering of man and call of bugle clamber up among the rock the companion see long rolling cloud of dust along the whole eastern sky line with the glint of spear and the flutter of pennon which announce the approach of large body of cavalry for moment wild hope come upon they that perhaps the prince have move more swiftly than have be plan that he have cross the ebro and that this be his vanguard sweep to the attack "surely see the red pile of chandos at the head of yonder squadron cry sir richard causton shade his eye with his hand "not so answer sir simon burley who have watch the approach host with darkening face it be even as fear that be the double eagle of du guesclin ""you say

thousand of they and all man at arm cry sir william felton see there be bertrand himself beside his banner and there be king henry who ride to welcome he now they all turn and come into the camp together "as he speak the vast throng of spaniards and of frenchmen troop across the plain with brandish arm and toss banner all day long the sound of revelry and of rejoice from the crowded camp swell up to the ear of the englishmen and they could see the soldier of the two nation throw themselves into each other 's arm and dance hand in hand round the blaze fire the sun have sink behind cloud bank in the west before sir nigel at last give word that the man should resume their arm and have their horse ready he have himself throw off his armor and have dress himself from head to foot in the harness of the capture spaniard "sir william say he it be my intention to attempt small deed and ask you therefore that you will lead this outfall upon the camp for i will ride into their camp

for it be not my wish that they should know that we be englishman say no word to any whom we may meet and if any speak to you pass on as though you hear they not be you ready?""i be ready my fair lord say alleyne "and and cry aylward and john "then the rest leave to your wisdom sir william and if god send we fortune we shall meet you again in this gorge ere it be dark "so say sir nigel mount the white horse of the spanish cavalier and ride quietly forth from his concealment with his three companion behind he alleyne lead his master 's own steed by the bridle so many small party of french and spanish horse be sweep hither and thither that the small band attract little notice and make its way at gentle trot across the plain they come as far as the camp without challenge or hindrance on and on they push past the endless line of tent amid the dense swarm of horseman and of footman until the huge royal pavilion stretch in front of they they be close upon it when of sudden there break out wild hubbub from distant portion of the camp with scream and war cry and all the wild tumult of battle at the sound soldier come rush from their tent knight shout loudly for their squire and there be mad turmoil on every hand of bewildered man and plunge horse at the royal tent crowd of gorgeously dress servant run hither and thither in helpless panic for the guard of soldier who be station there have already ride off in the direction of the alarm man at arm on either side of the doorway be the sole protector of the royal dwelling "i have come for the king whisper sir nigel and by saint paul he must back with we or must bide here "alleyne and aylward spring from their horse and fly at the two sentry who be disarm and beat down in an instant by so furious and unexpected an attack sir nigel dash into the royal tent and be follow by hordle john as soon as the horse have be secure from within come wild screaming and the clash of steel and then the two emerge once more their sword and forearm redden with blood while john bear over his shoulder the senseless body of man whose gay surcoat adorn with the lion and tower of castile proclaim he to belong to the royal house crowd of white face sewer and page swarm at their heel those behind push forwards while the foremost shrink back from the fierce face and reek weapon of the adventurer the senseless body be throw across the spare horse the four spring to their saddle and away they thunder with loose rein and busy spur through the swarming camp but confusion and disorder still reign among the spaniards for sir william felton and his man have sweep through half their camp leave long litter of the dead and the die to mark their course uncertain who be their attacker and unable to tell their english enemy from their newly arrive breton ally the spanish knight ride wildly hither and thither in aimless fury the mad turmoil the mixture of race and the fade light be all in favor of the four who alone know their own purpose among the vast uncertain multitude twice ere they reach open ground they have to break their way through small body of horse and once there come whistle of arrow and singing of stone about their ear but still dash onwards they shoot out from among the tent and find their own comrade retreat for the mountain at no very great distance from they another five minute of wild gallop over the plain and they be all back in their gorge while their pursuer fall back before the rolling of drum and blare of trumpet which seem to proclaim that the whole army of the prince be about to emerge from the mountain pass "by my soul nigel cry sir oliver wave great boil ham over his head have come by something which may eat with my truffle have hard fight for it for there be three of they with their mouth open and the knife in their hand all sit agape round the table when rush in upon they how say you sir william will you not try the smack of the famed spanish swine though we have but the brook water

night and that if have disorder his tent it be but in my eagerness to know so famed and courteous knight spur on comrade for we must cover many league ere we can venture to light fire or to loosen girth have hope to ride without this patch to night but it seem that must carry it yet little long "it be cold bleak morning in the beginning of march and the mist be drift in dense rolling cloud through the pass of the cantabrian mountain the company who have pass the night in sheltered gully be already astir some crowding round the blaze fire and other romp or leap over each other 's back for their limb be chill and the air biting here and there through the dense haze which surround they there loom out huge pinnacle and jut boulder of rock while high above the sea of vapor there tower up one gigantic peak with the pink glow of the early sunshine upon its snow cap head the ground be wet the rock dripping the grass and ever green sparkle with bead of moisture yet the camp be loud with laughter and merriment for messenger have ride in from the prince with word of heart stir praise for what they have do and with order that they should still abide in the forefront of the army

his liking and on the other hordle john who lie with his great limb all asprawl and his headpiece balance upon his uplifted foot black simon of norwich crouch amid the rock croon an eastland ballad to himself while he whet his sword upon flat stone which lie across his knee while beside he sit alleyne edricson and norbury the silent squire of sir oliver hold out their chill hand towards the crackling faggot "cast on another culpon john and stir the broth with thy sword sheath growl johnston look anxiously for the twentieth time at the reeking pot "by my hilt cry aylward now that john hath come by this great ransom he will scarce abide the fare of poor archer lad how say you camarade when you see hordle once more there will be no penny ale and fat bacon but gascon wine and baked meat every day of the seven ""i know not about that say john kick his helmet up into the air and catch it in his hand do but know that whether the broth be ready or no be about to dip this into it ""it simmer and it boil cry johnston push his hard line face through the smoke in an instant the pot have be pluck from the blaze and its content have be scoop up in half dozen steel head piece which be balance betwixt their owner knee while with spoon and gobbet of bread they devour their morning meal "it be ill weather for bow remark john at last when with long sigh he drain the last drop from his helmet my string be as limp as cow 's tail this morning ""you should rub they with water glue quoth johnston you remember samkin that it be wet than this on the morning of crecy and yet can not call to mind that there be aught amiss with our string ""it be in my thought say black simon still pensively grind his sword that we may have need of your string ere sundown dream of the red cow last night ""and what be this red cow simon ask alleyne "i know not young sir but can only say that on the eve of cadsand and on the eve of crecy and on the eve of nogent dream of red cow and now the dream have come upon i again so be now set very keen edge to my blade ""well say old war dog cry aylward by my hilt pray that your dream may come true for the prince hath not set we out here to drink broth or to gather whortle berry one more fight and be ready to hang up my bow marry wife and take to the fire corner but how now robin whom be it that you seek?""the lord loring crave your attendance in his tent say young archer to alleyne the squire rise and proceed to the pavilion where he find the knight seat upon cushion with his leg cross in front of he and broad ribbon of parchment lay across his knee over which he be pore with frown brow and pursed lip "it come this morning by the prince 's messenger say he and be bring from england by sir john fallislee who be new come from sussex what make you of this upon the outer side?""it be fairly and clearly write alleyne answer and it signify to sir nigel loring knight constable of twynham castle by the hand of christopher the servant of god at the priory of christchurch ""so read it say sir nigel now pray you to read what be set forth within "alleyne turn to the letter and as his eye rest upon it his face turn pale and cry of surprise and grief burst from his lip "what then ask the knight peer up at he anxiously there be nought amiss with the lady mary or with the lady maude?""it be my brother my poor unhappy brother cry alleyne with his hand to his brow he be dead ""by saint paul have never hear that he have show so much love for you that you should mourn he so ""yet he be my brother the only kith or kin that have upon earth mayhap he have cause to be bitter against i for his land be give to the abbey for my upbringing alas alas and raise my staff against he when last we meet he have be slay and slay fear amidst crime and violence ""ha say sir nigel read on pray you ""'god be with thee my honored lord and have thee in his holy keeping the lady loring hath ask i to set down in write what hath befall at twynham and all that concern the death of thy ill neighbor the socman of minstead for when ye have leave we this evil man gather around he all outlaw villein and masterless man until they be come to such force that they slay and scatter the king 's man who go against they then come forth from the wood they lay siege to thy castle and for two day they girt we in and shoot hard against we with such number as be marvel to see yet the lady loring hold the place stoutly and on the second day the socman be slay by his own man as some think so that we be deliver from their hand for which praise be to all the saint and more especially to the holy anselm upon whose feast it come to pass the lady loring and the lady maude thy fair daughter be in good health and so also be save for an imposthume of the toe joint which hath be send i for my sin may all the saint preserve thee!'""it be the vision of the lady tiphaine say sir nigel after pause marked you not how she say that the leader be one with yellow beard and how he fall before the gate but how come it alleyne that this woman to whom all thing be as crystal and who hath not say one word which have not come to pass be yet so lead astray as to say that your thought turn to twynham castle even more than my own?""my fair lord say alleyne with flush on his weather stain cheek the lady tiphaine may have speak sooth when she say it for twynham castle be in my heart by day and in my dream by night ""ha cry sir nigel with sidelong glance "yes my fair lord for indeed love your daughter the lady maude and unworthy as be would give my heart 's blood to serve she ""by st. paul edricson say the knight coldly arch his eyebrow you aim high in this matter our blood be very old ""and mine also be very old answer the squire "and the lady maude be our single child all our name and land centre upon she ""alas that should say it but also be now the only edricson ""and why have not hear this from you before alleyne in sooth think that you have use i ill ""nay my fair lord say not so for know not whether your daughter love i and there be no pledge between we "sir nigel ponder for few moment and then burst out laughing by st. paul say he know not why should mix in the matter for have ever find that the lady maud be very well able to look to her own affair since first she could stamp her little foot she hath ever be able to get that for which she crave and if she set her heart on thee alleyne and thou on she do not think that this spanish king with his three score thousand man could hold you apart yet this will say that would see you full knight ere you go to my daughter with word of love have ever say that brave lance should we she and by my soul edricson if god spare you think that you will acquit yourself well but enough of such trifle for we have our work before we and it will be time to speak of this matter when we see the white cliff of england once more go to sir william felton pray you and ask he to come hither for it be time that we be march there be no pass at the further end of the valley and it be perilous place should an enemy come upon we "alleyne deliver his message and then wander forth from the camp for his mind be all in whirl with this unexpected news and with his talk with sir nigel sit upon rock with his burn brow rest upon his hand he think of his brother of their quarrel of the lady maude in her bedraggled ride dress of the gray old castle of the proud pale face in the armory and of the last fiery word with which she have speed he on his way then he be but penniless monk breed lad unknown and unfriended now he be himself socman of minstead the head of an old stock and the lord of an estate
