bone we must play the man this day ""come hither alleyne say sir nigel walk back to the edge of the cliff which form the rear of their position and you norbury he continue beckon to the squire of sir oliver do you also come here "the two squire hurry across to he and the three stand look down into the rocky ravine which lie hundred and fifty foot beneath they "the prince must hear of how thing be with we say the knight another onfall we may withstand but they be many and we be few so that the time must come when we can no long form line across the hill yet if help be bring we we might hold the crest until it come see yonder horse which stray among the rock beneath us?""i see they my fair lord ""and see yonder path which wind along the hill upon the further end of the valley?""i see it ""were you on those horse and ride up yonder track steep and rough as it be think that ye might gain the valley beyond then on to the prince and tell he how we fare ""but my fair lord how can we hope to reach the horse ask norbury "ye can not go round to they for they would be upon ye ere ye could come to they think ye that ye have heart enough to clamber down this cliff?""had we but rope ""there be one here it be but one hundred foot long and for the rest ye must trust to god and to your finger can you try it alleyne?""with all my heart my dear lord but how can leave you in such strait?""nay it be to serve i that ye go and you norbury?"the silent squire say nothing but he take up the rope and having examine it he tie one end firmly round projecting rock then he cast off his breast plate thigh piece and greave while alleyne follow his example "tell chandos or calverley or knolle should the prince have go forward cry sir nigel now may god speed ye for ye be brave and worthy man "it be indeed task which might make the heart of the brave sink within he the thin cord dangle down the face of the brown cliff seem from above to reach little more than half way down it beyond stretch the rugged rock wet and shine with green tuft here and there thrust out from it but little sign of ridge or foothold far below the jagged point of the boulder bristle up dark and menacing norbury tug thrice with all his strength upon the cord and then lower himself over the edge while hundred anxious face peer over at he as he slowly clamber downward to the end of the rope twice he stretch out his foot and twice he fail to reach the point at which he aim but even as he swing himself for third effort stone from sling buzz like wasp from amid the rock and strike he full upon the side of his head his grasp relax his foot slip and in an instant he be crushed and mangle corpse upon the sharp ridge beneath he "if have no well fortune say alleyne lead sir nigel aside pray you my dear lord that you will give my humble service to the lady maude and say to she that be ever her true servant and most unworthy cavalier "the old knight say no word but he put hand on either shoulder and kiss his squire with the tear shine in his eye alleyne spring to the rope and slide swiftly down soon find himself at its extremity from above it seem as though rope and cliff be well nigh touching but now when swinge hundred foot down the squire find that he could scarce reach the face of the rock with his foot and that it be as smooth as glass with no resting place where mouse could stand some three foot low however his eye light upon long jagged crack which slant downward and this he must reach if he would save not only his own poor life but that of the eight score man above he yet it be madness to spring for that narrow slit with nought but the wet smooth rock to cling to he swing for moment full of thought and even as he hang there another of the hellish stone sing through his curl and strike chip from the face of the cliff up he clamber few foot draw up the loose end after he unsling his belt hold on with knee and with elbow while he splice the long tough leathern belt to the end of the cord then lower himself as far as he could go he swing backwards and forwards until his hand reach the crack when he leave the rope and clung to the face of the cliff another stone strike he on the side and he hear sound like break stick with keen stabbing pain which shoot through his chest yet it be no time now to think of pain or ache there be his lord and his eight score comrade and they must be pluck from the jaw of death on he clamber with his hand shuffle down the long sloping crack sometimes bear all his weight upon his arm at other find some small shelf or tuft on which to rest his foot would he never pass over that fifty foot he dared not look down and could but grope slowly onwards his face to the cliff his finger clutch his foot scrape and feel for support every vein and crack and mottling of that face of rock remained forever stamp upon his memory at last however his foot come upon broad resting place and he venture to cast glance downward thank god he have reach the high of those fatal pinnacle upon which his comrade have fall quickly now he spring from rock to rock until his foot be on the ground and he have his hand stretch out for the horse 's rein when sling stone strike he on the head and he drop senseless upon the ground an evil blow it be for alleyne but bad one still for he who strike it the spanish slinger see the youth lie slay and judge from his dress that he be no common man rush forward to plunder he know well that the bowman above he have expend their last shaft he be still three pace however from his victim 's side when john upon the cliff above pluck up huge boulder and poise it for an instant drop it with fatal aim upon the slinger beneath he it strike upon his shoulder and hurl he crush and scream to the ground while alleyne recall to his sense by these shrill cry in his very ear stagger on to his foot and gaze wildly about he his eye fall upon the horse graze upon the scanty pasture and in an instant all have come back to he his mission his comrade the need for haste he be dizzy sick faint but he must not die and he must not tarry for his life mean many life that day in an instant he be in his saddle and spur down the valley loud ring the swift charger 's hoofs over rock and reef while the fire fly from the stroke of iron and the loose stone shower up behind he but his head be whirl round the blood be gush from his brow his temple his mouth ever keener and sharper be the deadly pain which shoot like red hot arrow through his side he feel that his eye be glaze his sense slip from he his grasp upon the rein relax then with one mighty effort he call up all his strength for single minute stoop down he loosen the stirrup strap bind his knee tightly to his saddle flap twist his hand in the bridle and then put the gallant horse 's head for the mountain path he dash the spur in and fall forward faint with his face bury in the coarse black mane little could he ever remember of that wild ride half conscious but ever with the one thought beat in his mind he goad the horse onwards rush swiftly down steep ravine over huge boulder along the edge of black abyss dim memory he have of beetle cliff of group of hut with wonder face at the door of foaming clattering water and of bristle of mountain beech once ere he have ride far he hear behind he three deep sullen shout which tell he that his comrade have set their face to the foe once more then all be blank until he wake to find kindly blue english eye peer down upon he and to hear the bless sound of his country 's speech they be but forage party hundred archer and as many man at arm but their leader be sir hugh calverley and he be not man to bide idle when good blow be to be have not three league from he scout be send fly with message to the camp and sir hugh with his two hundred man thunder off to the rescue with they go alleyne still bind to his saddle still drip with blood and swoon and recover and swoon once again on they ride and on until at last top ridge they look down upon the fateful valley alas and alas for the sight that meet their eye there beneath they be the blood bathe hill and from the high pinnacle there flaunt the yellow and white banner with the lion and the tower of the royal house of castile up the long slope rush rank and rank of man exultant shout with wave pennon and brandish arm over the whole summit be dense throng of knight with no enemy that could be see to face they save only that at one corner of the plateau an eddy and swirl amid the crowded mass seem to show that all resistance be not yet at an end at the sight deep groan of rage and of despair go up from the baffled rescuer and spur on their horse they clatter down the long and winding path which lead to the valley beneath but they be too late to avenge as they have be too late to save long ere they could gain the level ground the spaniards see they ride swiftly amid the rock and be ignorant of their number draw off from the capture hill and having secure their few prisoner ride slowly in long column with drum beating and cymbal clash out of the valley their rear rank be already pass out of sight ere the new comer be urge their panting foam horse up the slope which have be the scene of that long draw and bloody fight and fearsome sight it be that meet their eye across the low end lie the dense heap of man and horse where the first arrow storm have burst above the body of the dead and the die french spanish and aragonese lay thick and thick until they cover the whole ground two and three deep in one dreadful tangle of slaughter above they lie the englishmen in their line even as they have stand and high yet upon the plateau wild medley of the dead of all nation where the last deadly grapple have leave they in the further corner under the shadow of great rock there crouch seven bowman with great john in the centre of they all wound weary and in sorry case but still unconquere with their blood stain weapon wave and their voice ring welcome to their countryman alleyne ride across to john while sir hugh calverley follow close behind he "by saint george cry sir hugh have never see sign of so stern fight and be right glad that we have be in time to save you ""you have save more than we say john point to the banner which lean against the rock behind he "you have do nobly cry the old free

the white company my fair lord say john "nay the white company be here disband answer sir hugh solemnly look round he at the line of silent figure look to the brave squire for fear that he will never see the sun rise again "it be bright july morning four month after that fatal fight in the spanish barranca blue heaven stretch above green rolling plain undulate below intersect with hedge row and fleck with grazing sheep the sun be yet low in the heaven and the red cow stand in the long shadow of the elm chew the cud and gaze with great vacant eye at two horseman who be spur it down the long white road which dip and curve away back to where the tower and pinnacle beneath the flat top hill mark the old town of winchester of the rider one be young graceful and fair clothe in plain doublet and hosen of blue brussels cloth which serve to show his active and well knit figure flat velvet cap be draw forward to keep the glare from his eye and he ride with lip compressed and anxious face as one who have much care upon his mind young as he be and peaceful as be his dress the dainty golden spur which twinkle upon his heel proclaim his knighthood while long seam upon his brow and scar upon his temple give manly grace to his refined and delicate countenance his comrade be large red head man upon great black horse with huge canvas bag sling from his saddle bow which jingle and clink with every movement of his steed his broad brown face be light up by continual smile and he look slowly from side to side with eye which twinkle and shine with delight well might john rejoice for be he not back in his native hampshire have he not don diego 's five thousand crown rasp against his knee and above all be he not himself squire now to sir alleyne edricson the young socman of minstead lately

wherever brave deed of arm be love and honor have flow in upon the few who have survive it for two month alleyne have waver betwixt death and life with broken rib and shattered head yet youth and strength and cleanly life be all upon his side and he awake from his long delirium to find that the war be over that the spaniards and their ally have be crush at navaretta and that the prince have himself hear the tale of his ride for succor and have come in person to his bedside to touch his shoulder with his sword and to insure that so brave and true man should die if he could not live within the order of chivalry the instant that he could set foot to ground alleyne have start in search of his lord but no word could he hear of he dead or alive and he have come home now sad hearted in the hope of raise money upon his estate and so start upon his quest once more land at london he have hurry on with mind full of care for he have hear no word from hampshire since the short note which have announce his brother 's death "by the rood cry john look around he exultantly where have we see since we leave such noble cow such fleecy sheep grass so green or man so drunk as yonder rogue who lie in the gap of the hedge?""ah john alleyne answer wearily it be well for you but never think that my home come would be so sad one my heart be heavy for my dear lord and for aylward and know not how may break the news to the lady mary and to the lady maude if they have not yet have tiding of it "john give groan which make the horse shy it be indeed black business say he but be not sad for shall give half these crown to my old mother and half will add to the money which you may have and so we shall buy that yellow cog wherein we sail to bordeaux and in it we shall go forth and seek sir nigel "alleyne smile but shake his head be he alive we should have have word of he ere now say he but what be this town before us?""why it be romsey cry john see the tower of the old gray church and the long stretch of the nunnery but here sit very holy man and shall give he crown for his prayer "three large stone form rough cot by the roadside and beside it bask in the sun sit the hermit with clay color face dull eye and long withered hand with crossed ankle and sink head he sit as though all his life have pass out of he with the bead slip slowly through his thin yellow finger behind he lie the narrow cell clay floor and damp comfortless profitless and sordid beyond it there lie amid the tree the wattle and daub hut of laborer the door open and the single room expose to the view the man ruddy and yellow haired stand lean upon the spade wherewith he have be at work upon the garden patch from behind he come the ripple of happy woman 's laughter and two young urchin dart forth from the hut bare legged and towsy while the mother step out lay her hand upon her husband 's arm and watch the gambol of the child the hermit frown at the untoward noise which break upon his prayer but his brow relax as he look upon the broad silver piece which john hold out to he "there lie the image of our past and of our future cry alleyne as they ride on upon their way now which be well to till god 's earth to have happy face round one 's knee and to love and be love or to sit forever moan over one 's own soul like mother over sick babe?""i know not about that say john for it cast great cloud over i when think of such matter but know that my crown be well spend for the man have the look of very holy person as to the other there be nought holy about he that could see and it would be cheap for i to pray for myself than to give crown to one who spend his day in dig for lettuce "ere alleyne could answer there swing round the curve of the road lady 's carriage draw by three horse abreast with postilion upon the outer one very fine and rich it be with beam paint and gild wheel and spoke carve in strange figure and over all an arched cover of red and white tapestry beneath its shade
