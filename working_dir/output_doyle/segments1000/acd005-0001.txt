way out of it but who be this gentleman his face be somewhat grimmer than those to which the court be accustom ha the king catch sight of he and louvois beckon to he to advance by my faith he be one who would be more at his ease in tent than under paint ceiling "the stranger who have attract racine 's attention be tall thin man with high aquiline nose stern fierce gray eye peep out from under tufte brow and countenance so lined and mark by age care and stress of weather that it stand out amid the prim courtier face which surround it as an old hawk might in cage of bird of gay plumage he be

the affair of god take precedence of those of france how do the conversion of the heathen prosper?""we can not complain sire the good father both jesuits and recollet have do their good though indeed they be both rather ready to abandon the affair of the next world in order to meddle with those of this ""what say you to that father ask louis glancing with twinkle of the eye at his jesuit confessor "i say sire that when the affair of this world have bearing upon those of the next it be indeed the duty of good priest as of every other good catholic to guide they right ""that be very true sire say de frontenac with an angry flush upon his swarthy cheek but as long as your majesty do i the honour to intrust those affair no my own guidance would brook no interference in the performance of my duty whether the meddler be clothe in coat or cassock ""enough sir enough say louis sharply have ask you about the mission ""they prosper sire there be iroquois at the sault and the mountain hurons at lorette and algonquins along the whole rivercotesfrom tadousac in the east to sault la marie and even the great plain of the dakotas who have all take the cross as their token marquette have pass down

frighten at their haggle face and twisted limb ""and you have suffer this cry louis hotly you allow these infamous assassin to live?""i have ask for troop sire ""and have send some ""one regiment ""the carignan saliere have no well in my service "but more be need sire ""there be the canadians themselves have you not militia could you not raise force enough to punish these rascally murderer of god 's priest have always understand that you be soldier "de frontenac 's eye flash and quick answer seem for an instant to tremble upon his lip but with an effort the fiery old man restrain himself your majesty will learn good whether be soldier or not say he by ask those who have see i at seneffe mulhausen salzbach and half score of other place where have the honour of uphold your majesty 's cause ""your service have not be forget ""it be just because be soldier and have see something of war that know how hard it be to penetrate into country much large than the lowlands all thick with forest and bog with savage lurking behind every tree who if he have not learn to step in time or to form line can at least bring down the run caribou at two hundred pace and travel three league to your one and then when you have at last reach their village and burn their empty wigwam and few acre of maize field what the well be you then you can but travel back again to your own land with cloud of unseen man lurk behind you and scalp yell for every straggler you be soldier yourself sire ask you if such war be an easy task for handful of soldier with fewcensitairesstraight from the plough and troop ofcoureur de boiswhose heart be all the time be with their trap and their beaver skin ""no no be sorry if speak too hastily say louis we shall look into the matter at our council ""then it warm my heart to hear you say so cry the old governor there will be joy down the long st. lawrence in white heart and in red when it be know that their great father over the water have turn his mind towards they ""and yet you must not look for too much for canada have be heavy cost to we and we have many call in europe ""ah sire would that you could see that great land when your majesty have win

ready to your hand it be so vast sire so rich so beautiful where be there such hill such forest such river and it be all for we if we will but take it who be there to stand in our way few nation of scatter indians and thin strip of english farmer and fisherman turn your thought there sire and in few year you would be able to stand upon your citadel at quebec and to say there be one great empire here from the snow of the north to the warm southern gulf and from the wave of the ocean to the great plain beyond marquette 's river and the name of this empire be france and her king be louis and her flag be thefleur de lis ."louis 's cheek have flush at this ambitious picture and he have lean forward in his chair with flash eye but he sink back again as the governor conclude "on my word count say he you have catch something of this gift ofindian eloquence of which we have hear but about these english folk they be huguenot be they not?""for the most part especially in the north ""then it might be service to holy church to send they pack they have city there be tell new new how do they call it?""new york sire they take it from the dutch ""ah new york and have not hear of another bos bos boston sire ""that be the name the harbour might be of service to we tell i now frontenac lower his voice so that his word might be audible only to the count louvois and the royal circle what force would you need to clear these people out one regiment two regiment and perhaps frigate or two?"but the ex governor shake his grizzle head you do not know they sire say he they be stern folk these we in canada with all your gracious help have find it hard to hold our own yet these man have have no help but only hindrance with cold and disease and barren land and indian war but they have thriven and multiply until the wood thin away in front of they like ice in the sun and their church bell be hear where but yesterday the wolf be howl they be peaceful folk and slow to war but when they have set their hand to it though they may be slack to begin they be slacker still to cease to put new england into your majesty 's hand would ask fifteen thousand of your good troop and twenty ship of the line "louis spring impatiently from his chair and catch up his cane wish say he that you would imitate these people who seem to you to be so formidable in their excellent habit of do thing for themselves the matter may stand until our council reverend father it have strike the hour of chapel and all else may wait until we have pay out duty to heaven take missal from the hand of an attendant he walk as fast as his very high heel would permit he towards the door the court form lane through which he might pass and then close up behind to follow he in order of precedence whilst louis have be afford his court that which he have openly state to be the high of human pleasure the sight of the royal face the young officer of the guard outside have be very busy pass on the title of the numerous applicant for admission and exchange usually smile or few word of greet with they for his frank handsome face be well know one at the court with his merry eye and his brisk bearing he look like man who be on good term with fortune indeed he have good cause to be so for she have use he well three year ago he have be an unknown subaltern bush fighting with algonquins and iroquois in

when the creature be plunge within few yard of deep gravel pit have do for he what ten campaign might have fail to accomplish now as trust officer of the king 's guard young gallant and popular his lot be indeed an enviable one and yet with the strange perversity of human nature he be already surfeit with the dull if magnificent routine of the king 's household and look back with regret to the rougher and free day of his early service even there at the royal door his mind have turn away from the frescoed passage and the group of courtier to the wild ravine and foam river of the west when suddenly his eye light upon face which he have last see among those very scene "ah monsieur de frontenac he cry you can not have forget i ""what de catinat ah it be joy indeed to see face from over
