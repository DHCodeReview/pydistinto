his foot and stare at the door as though he have some thought of force passage then turn on his heel he hasten away down the corridor with the air of man who have come to decision "there now grumble de catinat to himself as he pull at his thick dark moustache he be off to make some fresh mischief 'll have his sister here presently as like as not and pleasant little choice between break my order and make an enemy of she for life 'd rather hold fort richelieu against the iroquois than the king 's door against an angry woman by my faith here be lady as fear ah heaven be praise it be friend and not foe good morning mademoiselle nanon ""good morning captain de catinat "the new comer be tall graceful brunette her fresh face and sparkle black eye the bright in contrast with her plain dress "i

silver lace handkerchief of priceless genoa point half hide and half reveal her beautiful throat and be fasten in front by cluster of pearl while rope of the same each one worth bourgeois income be coil in and out through her luxuriant hair the lady be past her first youth it be true but the magnificent curve of her queenly figure the purity of her complexion the brightness of her deep lash blue eye and the clear regularity of her feature enable she still to claim to be the most handsome as well as the most sharp tongue woman in the court of france so beautiful be her bearing the carriage of her dainty head upon her proud white neck and the sweep of her stately walk that the young officer 's fear be overpower in his admiration and he find it hard as he raise his hand in salute to retain the firm countenance which his duty demand "ah it be captain de catinat say madame de montespan with smile which be more embarrassing to he than any frown could have be "your humble servant marquise ""i be fortunate in find friend here for there have be some ridiculous mistake this morning ""i be concerned to hear it ""it be about my brother monsieur de vivonne it be almost too laughable to mention but he be actually refuse admission to thelever .""it be my misfortune to have to refuse he madame ""you captain de catinat and by what right she have draw up her superb figure and her large blue eye be blaze with indignant astonishment "the king 's order madame ""the king be it likely that the king would cast public slight upon my family from whom have you this preposterous order?""direct from the king through bontems ""absurd do you think that the king would venture to exclude mortemart through the mouth of valet you have be dream captain ""i trust that it may prove so madame ""but such dream be not very fortunate to the dreamer go tell the king that be here and would have word with he ""impossible madame ""and why?""i have be forbid to carry message ""to carry any message?""any from you madame ""come captain you improve it only need this insult to make the thing complete you may carry message to the king from any adventuress from any decayed governess she laugh shrilly at her description of her rival but none from francoise de mortemart marquise de montespan?""such be my order madame it pain i deeply to be compel to carry they out ""you may spare your

forward at the door but he slip in front of she with outstretche arm "for god 's sake consider yourself madame he entreat other eye be upon you ""pah canaille she glance at the knot of switzers whose sergeant have draw they off few pace and who stand open eyed stare at the scene "i tell you that iwillsee the king ""no lady have ever be at the morninglever .""then shall be the first ""you will ruin i if you pass ""and none the less shall do so "the matter look serious de catinat be man of resource but for once he be at his wit end madame de montespan 's resolution as it be call in her presence or effrontery as it be term behind she back be proverbial if she attempt to force her way would he venture to use violence upon one who only yesterday have hold the fortune of the whole court in the hollow of her hand and who with her beauty her wit and her energy might very well be in the same position to morrow if she pass he then his future be ruin with the king who never brook the small deviation from his order on the other hand if he thrust she back he do that which could never be forgive and which would entail some deadly vengeance should she return to power it be an unpleasant dilemma but happy thought flash into his mind at the very moment when she with clenched hand and flash eye be on the point of make fresh attempt to pass he "if madame would deign to wait say he soothingly the king will be on his way to the chapel in an instant ""it be not yet time ""i think the hour have just go ""and why should wait like lackey?""it be but moment madame ""no shall not wait she take step forward towards the door but the guardsman 's quick ear have catch the sound of move foot from within and he know that he be master of the situation "i will take madame 's message say he "ah you have recover your sense go tell the king that wish to speak with he "he must gain little time yet shall say it through the lord in waiting?""no yourself ""publicly?""no no for his private ear ""shall give reason for your request?""oh you madden i say what have tell you and at once "but the young officer 's dilemma be happily over at that instant the double door be swing open and louis appear in the opening strut forwards on his high heeled shoe his stick tap his broad skirt flap and his courtier spread out behind he he stop as he come out and turn to the captain of the guard "you have note for me?""yes sire "the monarch slip it into the pocket of his scarlet undervest and be advance once more when his eye fall upon madame de montespan stand very stiff and erect in the middle of the passage dark flush of anger shoot to his brow and he walk swiftly past she without word but she turn and keep pace with he down the corridor "i have not expect this honour madame say he "nor have expect this insult sire ""an insult madame you forget yourself ""no it be you who have forget i sire ""you intrude upon i ""i wish to hear my fate from your own lip she whisper can bear to be strike myself sire even by he who have my heart but it be hard to hear that one 's brother have be wound through the mouth of valet and huguenot soldier for no fault of his save that his sister have love too fondly ""it be no time to speak of such thing ""when can see you then sire?""in your chamber ""at what hour?""at four ""then shall trouble your majesty no far she sweep he one of the graceful courtesy for which she be famous and turn away down side passage with triumph shine in her eye her beauty and her spirit have never fail she yet and now that she have the monarch 's promise of an interview she never doubt that she could do as she have do before and win back the heart of the man however much against the conscience of the king louis have walk on to his devotion in no very charitable frame of mind as be easily to be see from his clouded brow and compress lip he know his late favourite well she impulsiveness her audacity her lack of all restraint when thwart or oppose she be capable of make hideous scandal of turn against he that bitter tongue which have so often make he laugh at the expense of other perhaps even of make some public exposure which would leave he the butt and gossip of europe he shudder at the thought at all cost such catastrophe must be avert and yet how could he cut the tie which bind they he have break other such bond as these but the gentle la valliere have shrink into convent at the very first glance which have tell she of wane love that be true affection but this woman would struggle hard fight to the bitter end before she would quit the position which be so dear to she she speak of her wrong what be her wrong in his intense selfishness nurture by the eternal flattery which be the very air he breathe he could not see that the fifteen year of her life which he have absorb or the loss of the husband whom he have supplant give she any claim upon he in his view he have raise she to the high position which subject could occupy now he be weary of she and it be her duty to retire with resignation nay even with gratitude for past favour she should have pension and the child should be care for what could reasonable woman ask for more?and then his motive for discard she be so excellent he turn they over in his mind as he knelt listen to the archbishop of paris recite the mass and the more he think the more he approve his conception of the deity be as large louis and of heaven as more gorgeous versaille if he exact obedience from his twenty million then he must show it also to this one who have right to demand it of he on the whole his conscience acquit he but in this one matter he have be lax from the first coming of his gentle and forgive young wife from spain he have never once permit she to be without rival now that she be dead the matter be no well one favourite have succeed another and if de montespan have hold her own so long it be rather from her audacity than from his affection but now father la chaise and bossuet be ever remind he that he have top the summit of his life and be already upon that downward path which lead to the grave his wild outburst over the unhappy fontange have represent the last flicker of his passion the time have come for gravity and for calm neither of which be to be expect in the company of madame de montespan but he have find out where they be to be enjoy from the day when de montespan have introduce the stately and silent widow as governess for his child he have find never fail and ever increase pleasure in her society in the early day of she come he have sit for hour in the room of his favourite watch the tact and sweetness of temper with which her dependent control the mutinous spirit of the petulant young duc du maine and the mischievous little comte de toulouse he have be there nominally for the purpose of superintend the teaching but he have confine himself to admire the teacher and then in time he too have be draw into the attraction of that strong sweet nature and have find himself consult she upon point of conduct and act upon her advice with docility which he have never show before to minister or mistress for time he have think that her piety and her talk of principle might be mere mask for he be accustomed to hypocrisy all round he it be surely unlikely that woman who be still beautiful with as bright an eye and as graceful figure as any in his court could after life spend in the gay circle preserve the spirit of nun but on this point he be soon undeceived for when his own language have become warm than that of friendship he have be meet by an iciness of manner and brevity of speech which have show he that there be one woman at least in his dominion who have high respect for herself than for he and perhaps it be well so the placid pleasure of friendship be very soothe after the storm of passion to sit in her room every afternoon to listen to talk which be not taint with flattery and to hear opinion which be not frame to please his ear be the occupation now of his happy hour and then her influence over he be all so good she speak of his kingly duty of his example to his subject of his preparation for the world beyond and of the need for an effort to snap the guilty tie which he have form she be as good as confessor confessor with lovely face and perfect arm and now he know that the time have come when he must choose between she and de montespan their influence be antagonistic they could not continue together he stand between virtue and vice and he must choose vice be very attractive too very comely very witty and hold he by that chain of custom which be so hard to shake off there be hour when his nature sway strongly over to that side and when he be tempt to fall back into his old life but bossuet and pere la chaise be ever at his elbow to whisper encouragement and above all there be madame de maintenon to remind he of what be due to his position and to his six and forty year now at last he have brace himself for supreme effort there be no safety for he while his old favourite be at court he know himself too well to have any faith in last change so long as she be there ever wait for his moment of weakness she must be persuade to leave versailles if without scandal it could be do he would be firm when he meet she in the afternoon and make she understand once for all that her reign be forever over such be the thought which run through the king 's head as he bend over the rich crimson cushion which top hisprie dieuof carve oak he kneel in his own enclosure to the right of the altar with his guard and his immediate household around he while the court lady and cavalier fill the chapel piety be fashion now like dark overcoat and lace cravat and no courtier be so worldly minded as not to have have touch of grace since the king have take to religion yet they look very bored these soldier and seigneur yawn and blink over the missal while some who seem more intent upon their devotion be really dip into the late romance of scudery or calpernedi cunningly bind up in sombre cover the lady indeed be more devout and be determine that all should see it for each have light tiny taper which she hold in front of she on the plea of light up her missal but really that her face might be visible to the king and inform he that hers be kindre spirit few there may have be here and there whose prayer rise from their heart and who be there of their own free will but the policy of louis have change his nobleman into courtier and his man of the world into hypocrite until the whole court be like one gigantic mirror which reflect his own likeness hundredfold it be the habit of louis as he walk back from the chapel to receive petition or to listen to any tale of wrong which his subject might bring to he his way as he return to his room lie partly across an open space and here it be that the suppliant be wo nt to assemble on this particular morning there be but two or three parisian who conceive himself injure by the provost of his guild peasant whose cow have be tear by huntsman 's dog and farmer who have have hard usage from his feudal lord few question and then hurried order to his secretary dispose of each case for if louis be tyrant himself he have at least the merit that he insist upon be the only one within his kingdom he be about to resume his way again when an elderly man clothe in the garb of respectable citizen and with strong deep line face which mark he as man of character dart forward and throw himself down upon one knee in front of the monarch "justice sire justice he cry "what be this then ask louis who be you and what be it that you want?""i be citizen of paris and have be cruelly wrong ""you seem very worthy person if you have indeed be wrong you shall have redress what have you to complain of?""twenty of the blue dragoons of languedoc be quarter in my house with captain dalbert at their head they have devour my food steal my property and beat my servant yet the magistrate will give i no redress '"on my life justice seem to be administer in strange fashion in our city of paris exclaim the king wrathfully "it be indeed shameful case say bossuet "and yet there may be very good reason for it suggest pere la chaise would suggest that your majesty should ask this man his name his business and why it be that the dragoon be quarter upon he ""you hear the reverend father 's question ""my name sire be catinat by trade be merchant in cloth and be treat in this fashion because be of the reformed church ""i think as much cry the confessor "that alter matter say bossuet the king shake his head and his brow darken you have only yourself to thank then the remedy be in your hand ""and how sire?""by embrace the only true faith ""i be already member of it sire "the king stamp his foot angrily can see that you be very insolent heretic say he there be but one church in france and that be my church if you be outside that you can not look to i for aid ""my creed be that of my father sire and of my grandfather ""if they have sin it be no reason why you should my own grandfather err also before his eye be open ""but he nobly atone for his error murmur the jesuit "then you will not help i sire?""you must first help yourself "the old huguenot stand up with gesture of despair while the king continue on his way the two ecclesiastic on either side of he murmur their approval into his ear "you have do nobly sire ""you be truly the first son of the church ""you be the worthy successor of st. louis "but the king bear the face of man who be not absolutely satisfied with his own action "you do not think then that these people have too hard measure say he "too hard nay your majesty err on the side of mercy ""i hear that they be leave my kingdom in great number ""and surely it be well so sire for what blessing can come upon country which have such stubborn infidel within its boundaries?""those who be traitor to god can scarce be loyal to the king remark bossuet your majesty 's power would be great if there be no temple as they call their den of heresy within your dominion ""my grandfather promise they protection they be shield as you well know by the edict which be give at nantes ""but it lie with your majesty to undo the mischief that have be do ""and how?""by recall the edict ""and drive into the open arm of my enemy two million of my good artisan and of my brave servant no no father have trust every zeal for mother church but there be some truth in what de frontenac say this morning of the evil which come from mix the affair of this world with those of the next how say you louvois?""with all respect to the church sire would say that the devil have give these man such cunning of hand and of brain that they be the good worker and trader in your majesty 's kingdom know not how the state coffer be to be fill if such tax payer go from among we already many have leave the country and take their trade with they if all be to go it would be bad for we than lose campaign ""but remark bossuet if it be once know that the king 's will have be express your majesty may rest assure that even the bad of his subject bear he such love that they would hasten to come within the pale of holy church as long as the edict stand it seem to they that the king be lukewarm and that they may abide in their error "the king shake his head they have always be stubborn folk say he "perhap remark louvois glance maliciously at bossuet be the bishop of france to make an offering to the state of the treasure of their see we might then do without these huguenot taxis ""all that the church have be at the king 's service answer bossuet curtly "the kingdom be mine and all that be in it remark louis as they enter thegrand salon in which the court assemble after chapel yet trust that it may be long before have to claim the wealth of the church ""we trust so sire echo the ecclesiastic "but we may reserve such topic for our council chamber where be mansard must see his plan for the new wing at marly he cross to side table and be bury in an instant in his favourite pursuit inspect the gigantic plan of the great architect and inquire eagerly as to the progress of the work "i think say pere la chaise draw bossuet aside that your grace have make some impression upon the king 's mind ""with your powerful assistance father ""oh you may rest assure that shall lose no opportunity of push on the good work ""if you take it in hand it be do ""but there be another who have more weight than i.""the favourite de montespan?""no no her day be go
