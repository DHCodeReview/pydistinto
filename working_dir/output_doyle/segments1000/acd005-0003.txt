nor powder but nature have put her own silvering upon his thick grizzle lock and the thousand pucker which cluster round the edge of his eye or draw at the corner of his mouth give set gravity to his face which need no device of the barber to increase it yet in spite of his mature year the swift anger with which he have spring up when the king refuse his plaint and the keen fiery glance which he have shoot at the royal court as they file past he with many scornful smile and whisper gibe at his expense all show that he have still preserve something of the strength and of the spirit of his

break brutally into the current of his thought "now hymn book say one gruffly get off again about your business ""you're not very pretty ornament to the king 's pathway cry the other with hideous oath who be you to turn up your nose at the king 's religion curse you?"the old huguenot shoot glance of anger and contempt at they and be turn to go when one of they thrust at his rib with the butt end of his halberd "take that you dog he cry would you dare to look like that at the king 's guard?""children of belial cry the old man with his hand press to his side be twenty year young you would not have

halberd and rush upon the old man but tall and strong as they be they find it no easy matter to secure he with his long sinewy arm and his wiry frame he shake himself clear of they again and again and it be only when his breath have fail he that the two torn and panting be able to twist round his wrist and so secure he they have hardly win their pitiful victory however before stern voice and sword flash before their eye compel they to release their prisoner once more it be captain de catinat who his morning duty over have stroll out on to the terrace and have come upon this sudden scene of outrage at the sight of the old man 's face he give violent start and draw his sword have rush forward with such fury that the two guardsman not only drop their victim but stagger back from the threaten sword point one of they slip and the other roll over he revolving mass of blue coat and white kersey "villain roar de catinat what be the meaning of this?"the two have stumble on to their foot again very shamefaced and ruffle "if you please captain say one salute this be huguenot who abuse the royal guard ""his petition have be reject by the king captain and yet he refuse to go "de catinat be white with fury and so when french citizen have come to have word with the great master of his country he must be harass by two swiss dog like you he cry by my faith we shall soon see about

arise from it "no say de catinat with sudden happy thought charge they with lay their halberd down while on duty and with have their uniform dirty and disarrange ""that be well answer the sergeant with the freedom of privileged veteran thunder of god but you have disgrace the guard an hour on the wooden horse with musket at either foot may teach you that halberd be make for soldier 's hand and not for the king 's grass plot seize they attention right half turn march!"and away go the little clump of guardsmen with the sergeant in the rear the huguenot have stand in the background grave and compose without any sign of exultation during this sudden reversal of fortune but when the soldier be go he and the young officer turn warmly upon each other "amory have not hope to see you!""nor you uncle what in the name of wonder bring you toversailles?""my wrong amory the hand of the wicked be heavy upon we and whom can we turn to save only the king?"the young officer shake his head the king

persecutor of his people ""tut uncle say the young man impatiently be soldier of the king 's and be willing to let the black gown and the white surplice settle these matter between they let i live in honour and die in my duty and be content to wait to know the rest ""content too to live in palace and eat from fine linen say the huguenot bitterly when the hand of the wicked be heavy upon your kinsfolk and there be breaking of phial and pour forth of tribulation and wailing and weeping throughout the land ""what be amiss then ask the young soldier who be somewhat mystify by the scriptural language in use among the french calvinists of the day "twenty man of moab have be quarter upon i with one dalbert their captain who have long be scourge to israel ""captain claude dalbert of the languedoc dragoons have already some small score to settle with he ""ay and the scatter remnant have also score against this murderous dog and self seek ziphite ""what have he do then?""his man be

about your cousin adele ""oh the young man 's colour have be rise and his brow knit at each successive charge but at this last his anger boil over and he hurry forward with fury in his face drag his elderly companion by the elbow they have be pass through one of those wind path border by high hedge which thin away every here and there to give glimpse of some prowl faun or weary nymph who slumber in marble amid the foliage the few courtier who meet they gaze with surprise at so ill assorted pair of companion but the young soldier be too full of his own plan to waste thought upon their speculation still hurry on he follow crescent path which lead past dozen stone dolphin shoot water out of their mouth over group of tritons and so through an avenue of great tree which look as if they have grow there for century and yet had in truth be carry over that very year by incredible labour from st. germain and fontainebleau beyond this point small gate lead out of the ground and it be through it that the two pass the eld man puff and pant with this unusual haste "how do you come uncle?""in caleche ""where be it?""that be it beyond the auberge ""come let we make for it ""and you amory be you coming?""my faith it be time that come from what you tell i there be room for man with sword at his side in this establishment of yours ""but what would you do?""i would have word with this captain dalbert ""then have wrong you nephew when say even now that you be not whole hearted towards israel ""i know not about israel cry de catinat impatiently only know that if my adele choose

driver and five livre to you if you pass the gate of the invalides within the hour "it be no light matter to drive fast in an age of springless carriage and deeply rut road but the driver lash at his two rough unclipped horse and the caleche jolt and clatter upon its way as they speed on with the road side tree dance past the narrow window and the white dust stream behind they the guardsman drum his finger upon his knee and fidget in his seat with impatience shoot an occasional question across at his grim companion "when be all this then?""it be yesterday night ""and where be adele now?""she be at home ""and this dalbert?""oh he be there also!""what you have leave she in his power while you come away toversailles?""she be lock in her room ""pah what be lock the young man rave with his

he and tell he strange tale ""what guard could he be he be stranger in strange land you do ill to leave adele thus uncle ""she be in god 's hand amory ""i trust so oh be on fire to be there!"he thrust his head through the cloud of dust which rise from the wheel and crane his neck to look upon the long curve river and broad spread city which be already visible before they half hide by thin blue haze through which shoot the double tower of notre dame with the high spire of st. jacques and forest of other steeple and minaret the monument of eight hundred year of devotion soon as the road curve down to the river bank the city wall grow near and near until they have pass the southern gate and be rattle over the stony causeway leave the broad luxembourg upon their right and colbert 's last work the invalides upon their left sharp turn bring they on to the river quay and cross over the pont neuf they skirt the stately louvre and plunge into the labyrinth of narrow but important street which extend to the northward the young officer have his head still thrust out of the window but his view be obscure by broad gild carriage which lumber heavily along in front of they as the road broaden however it swerve to one side and he be able to catch glimpse of the house to which they be make it be surround on every side by an immense crowd the house of the huguenot merchant be tall narrow building stand at the corner of the rue st. martin and the rue de biron it be four story in height grim and grave like its owner with high peaked roof long diamond pan window frame work of black wood with gray plaster fill the interstice and five stone step which lead up to the narrow and sombre door the upper story be but warehouse in which the trader keep his stock but the second and third be furnish with balcony edge with stout wooden balustrade as the uncle and the nephew spring out of the caleche they find themselves upon the outskirt of dense crowd of people who be sway and toss with excitement their chin all throw forwards and their gaze direct upwards follow their eye the young officer see sight which leave he stand bereft of every sensation save amazement from the upper balcony there be hang head downward man clothe in the bright blue coat and white breech of one of the king 's dragoon his hat and wig have drop off and his close cropped head swing slowly backwards and forwards good fifty foot above the pavement his face be turn towards the street and be of deadly whiteness while his eye be screw up as though he dared not open they upon the horror which face they his voice however resound over the whole place until the air be fill with his scream for mercy above he at the corner of the balcony there stand young man who lean with bent back over the balustrade and who hold the dangle dragoon by either ankle his face however be not direct towards his victim but be half turn over his shoulder to confront group of soldier who be cluster at the long open window which lead out into the balcony his head as he glance at they be poise with proud air of defiance while they surge and oscillate in the opening uncertain whether to rush on or to retire suddenly the crowd give groan of excitement the young man have release his grip upon one of the ankle and the dragoon hang now by one only his other leg flap helplessly in the air he grab aimlessly with his hand at the wall and the wood work behind he still yell at the pitch of his lung "pull i up son of the devil pull i up he scream would you murder i then help good people help!""do you want to come up captain say the strong clear voice of the young man above he speak excellent french but in an accent which fall strangely upon the ear of the crowd beneath "yes sacred name of god yes!""order off your man then ""away you dolt you imbecile do you wish to see i dash to piece away say off with you!""that be well say the youth when the soldier have vanish from the window he give tug at the dragoon 's

quite secure ""then pull i up!""not so fast captain you can talk very well where you be ""let i up sir let i up!""all in good time fear that it be inconvenient to you to talk with your heel in the air

then stagger to his foot without glance at his opponent he rush with bellow of rage through the open window while this little drama have be enact overhead the young guardsman have shake off his first stupor of amazement and have push his way through the crowd with such vigour that he and his companion have nearly reach the bottom of the step the uniform of the king 's guard be in itself passport

hand in the dark passage "oh master oh master he cry "such doing such infamy they will murder him!""whom then?""this brave monsieur from america oh my god hark to they now!"as he speak clatter and shout which have burst out again upstairs end suddenly in tremendous crash with volley of oath and prolonged bumping and smashing which shake the old house to its foundation the soldier and the huguenot rush swiftly up the first flight of stair and be about to ascend the second one from the head of which the uproar seem to proceed when great eight day clock came hurtle down spring four step at time and end with leap across the landing and crash against the wall which leave it shatter heap of metal wheel and wooden splinter an instant afterwards four man so lock together that they form

twined be they that it be hard to pick one from the other save that the innermost be clothe in black flemish cloth while the three who cling to he be soldier of the king yet so strong and vigorous be the man whom they try to hold that as often as he could find his foot he drag they after he from end to end of the passage as boar might pull the cur which have fasten on to his haunch an officer who have rush down at the heel of the brawler thrust his hand in to catch the civilian by the throat but he whip they back again with an oath as the man 's
