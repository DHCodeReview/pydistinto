for i to go ""and how like you paris?"the young man smile they tell i ere come that it be very lively place and truly from the little that have see this morning think that it be the lively place that have see ""by my faith say de catinat you come down those stair in very lively fashion four of you together with dutch clock as anavant courier and whole train of wood work at your heel and you have not see the city yet?""only as journey through it yester evening on my way to this house it be wondrous place but be pen in for lack of air as pass through it new york be great city there be say to be as many as three thousand folk live there and they say that they could send out four hundred fighting man though can scarce bring myself to believe it yet from all part of the city one may see something of god 's handiwork the tree the green of the grass and the shine of the sun upon the bay and the river but here it be stone and wood and wood and stone look where you will in truth you must be very hardy people to keep your health in such place ""and to we it be you who seem so hardy with your life in the forest and on the river cry the young girl and then the wonder that you can find your path through those great wilderness where there be naught to guide you ""well there again marvel how you can find your way among these thousand of house for myself trust that it will be clear night to night ""and why?""that may see the star ""but you will find no change in they ""that be it if can but see the star it will be easy for i to know how to walk when would find this house again in the daytime can carry knife and notch the door post as pass for it might be hard to pick up one 's trail again with so many folk ever pass over it "de catinat burst out laugh again by my faith you will find paris lively than ever say he if you blaze your way through on the door post as you would on the tree of forest but perchance it would be as well that you should have guide at first so if you have two horse ready in your stable uncle our friend and might shortly ride back to versailles together for have spell of guard again before many hour be over then for some day he might bide with i there if he will share soldier 's quarter and so see more than the rue st. martin can offer how would that suit you monsieur green?""i should be right glad to come out with you if we may leave all here in safety ""oh fear not for that say the huguenot the order of the prince of conde will be as shield and buckler to we for many day will order pierre to saddle the horse ""and must use the little time have say the guardsman as he turn away to where adele wait for he in the window the young american be soon ready for the expedition but de catinat linger until the last possible minute when at last he be able to tear himself away he adjust his cravat brush his brilliant coat and look very critically over the sombre suit of his companion "where get you those he ask "in new york ere leave ""hem there be naught amiss with the cloth and indeed the sombre colour be the mode but the cut be strange to our eye ""i only know that wish that have my fringed hunting tunic and legging on once more ""this hat now we do not wear our brim flat like that see if can not mend it he take the beaver and loop up one side of the brim he fasten it with golden brooch take from his own shirt front there be martial cock say he laugh and would do credit to the king 's own musketeers the black broad cloth and silk hose will pass but why have you not sword at your side?""i carry gun when ride out mon dieu you will be lay by the heel as bandit!""i have knife too ""worse and bad well we must dispense with the sword and with the gun too pray let i re tie your cravat so now if you be in the mood for ten mile gallop be at your service "they be indeed singular contrast as they walk their horse together through the narrow and crowded causeway of the parisian street de catinat who be the old by five year with his delicate small feature face his sharply trim moustache his small but well set and dainty figure and his brilliant dress look the very type of the great nation to which he belong his companion however large limbe and strong turn his bold and yet thoughtful face from side to side and eagerly take in all the strange new life amidst which he find himself be also type unfinished it be true but bid fair to be the high of the two his close yellow hair blue eye and heavy build show that it be the blood of his father rather than that of his mother which run in his vein and even the sombre coat and swordless belt if less pleasing to the eye be true badge of race which find its fierce battle and its most glorious victory in bend nature to its will upon the sea and in the waste place of the earth "what be yonder great building he ask as they emerge into broad square "it be the louvre one of the palace of the king ""and be he there?""nay he live at versailles ""what fancy that man should have two such houses!""two he have many more st. germain marly fontainebleau clugny ""but to what end man can but live at one at time ""nay he can now come or go as the fancy take he ""it be wondrous building have see the seminary of st. sulpice at montreal and think that it be the great of all house and yet what be it beside this?""you have be to montreal then you remember the fort?""yes and the hotel dieu and the wooden house in row and eastward the great mill with the wall but what do you know of montreal?""i have soldier there and at quebec too why my friend you be not the only man of the wood in paris for give you my word that have wear the caribou mocassin the leather jacket and the fur cap with the eagle feather for six month at stretch and care not how soon do it again,"amos green 's eye shine with delight at find that his companion and he have so much in common and he plunge into series of question which last until they have cross the river and reach the south westerly gate of the city by the moat and wall long line of man be busy at their drill "who be those then he ask gaze at they with curiosity "they be some of the king 's soldier ""but why so many of they do they await some enemy?""nay we be at peace with all the world bad luck!""at peace why then all these men?""that they may be ready "the young man shake his head in bewilderment they might be as ready in their own home surely in our country every man have his musket in his chimney corner and be ready enough yet he do not waste his time when all be at peace ""our king be very great and he have many enemy ""and who make the enemies?""why the king to be sure
