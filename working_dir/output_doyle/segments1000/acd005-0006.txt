europe all be dull and lacking in flavour what use be it to have all pleasure before i when it turn to wormwood when it be tasted?""true pleasure sire lie rather in the inward life the serene mind the easy conscience and then as we grow old be it not natural that our mind should take graver bent we might well reproach ourselves if it be not so for it would show that we have not learn the lesson of life ""it may be so and yet it be sad and weary when nothing amuse but who be there?""it be my companion knock what be it mademoiselle?""monsieur corneille to read to the king say the young lady open

send his friend in his place shall admit him?""oh as you like madame as you like say the king listlessly at sign from mademoiselle nanon little peaky man with shrewd petulant face and long gray hair fall back over his shoulder enter the room he bow profoundly three time and then seat himself nervously on the very edge of the stool from which the lady have remove her work basket she smile and nod to encourage the poet while the monarch lean back in his chair with an air of resignation "shall it be comedy or tragedy or burlesque pastoral corneille ask timidly "not the burlesque pastoral say the king with decision such thing may be play but can not be read since they be for the eye rather than the ear "the poet bow his acquiescence "and not the tragedy monsieur say madame de maintenon glance up from her tapestry the king have enough that be serious in his graver hour and so trust that you will use your talent to amuse he ""ay let it be comedy say louis have not have good laugh since poor moliere pass away ""ah your majesty have indeed fine taste cry the courtier poet have you condescend to turn your own attention to poetry where should we all have be then?"louis smile for no flattery be too gross to please he "even as you have teach our general war and our builder art so you would have set your poor singer lofty strain but mars would hardly deign to share the humble laurel of apollo ""i have sometimes think that have some such power answer the king complacently though amid my toil and the burden of state have have as you say little time for the soft art ""but you have encourage other to do what you could so well have do yourself sire you have bring out poet as the sun bring out flower how many have we not see moliere boileau racine one great than the other and the other too the small one scarron so scurrilous and yet so witty oh holy virgin what have said?"madame have lay down her tapestry and be stare in intense indignation at the poet who writhe on his stool under the stern rebuke of those cold gray eye "i think monsieur corneille that you have well go on with your reading say the king dryly "assuredly sire shall read my play about darius?""and who be darius ask the king whose education have be so neglect by the crafty policy of cardinal mazarin that he be ignorant of everything save what have come under his own personal observation "darius be king of persia sire ""and where be persia?""it be kingdom of asia ""is darius still king there?""nay sire he fight against alexander the great ""ah have hear of alexander he be famous king and general be he not?""like your majesty he both rule wisely and lead his army victoriously ""and be king of persia you say?""no sire of macedonia it be darius who be king of persia "the king frown for the slight correction be offensive to he "you do not seem very clear about the matter and confess that it do not interest i deeply say he pray turn to something else ""there be mypretended astrologer .""yes that will do "corneille commence to read his comedy while madame de maintenon 's white and delicate finger pick among the many colour silk which she be weave into her tapestry from time to time she glance across first at the clock and then at the king who be lean back with his lace handkerchief throw over his face it be twenty minute to four now but she know that she have put it back half an hour and that the true time be ten minute past "tut tut cry the king suddenly there be something amiss there the second last line have limp in it surely it be one of his foible to pose as critic and the wise poet would fall in with his correction however unreasonable they might be "which line sire it be indeed an advantage to have one 's fault make clear ""read the passage again et si quand je lui dis le secret de mon ame avec moin de rigueur elle eut traite ma flamme dans ma fayon de vivre et suivant mon humeur une autre eut bientot le present de mon coeur ""yes the third line have foot too many do you not remark it madame?""no but fear that should make poor critic ""your majesty be perfectly right say corneille unblushingly "i shall mark the passage and see that it be correct ""i think that it be wrong if do not write myself you can see that have at least get the correct ear false quantity jar upon i it be the same in music although know little of the matter can tell discord where lully himself would miss it have often show he error of the sort in his opera and have always convince he that be right ""i can readily believe it your majesty corneille have pick up his book again and be about to resume his reading when there come sharp tap at the door "it be his highness the minister monsieur de louvois saidmademoiselle nanon "admit he answer louis monsieur corneille be oblige to you for what you have read and regret that an affair of state will now interrupt your comedy some other day perhaps may have the pleasure of hear the rest of it he smile in the gracious fashion which make all who come within his personal influence forget his fault and remember he only as the impersonation of dignity and of courtesy the poet with his book under his arm slip out while the famous minister tall heavily wigged eagle nosed and commanding came bow into the little room his manner be that of exaggerated politeness but his haughty face mark only too plainly his contempt for such chamber and for the lady who dwell there she be well aware of the feeling with which he regard she but her perfect self command prevent she from ever by word or look return his dislike "my apartment be indeed honour to day say she rise with outstretche hand can monsieur condescend to stool since have no fitter seat to offer you in this little doll 's house but perhaps be in the way if you wish to talk of state affair to the king can easily withdraw into my boudoir ""no no nothing of the kind madame cry louis it be my wish that you should remain here what be it louvois?""a messenger arrive from england with despatch your majesty answer the minister his ponderous figure balance upon the three legged stool there be very ill feeling there and there be some talk of rise the letter from lord sunderland wish to know whether in case the dutch take the side of the malcontent the king might look to france for help of course know your majesty 's mind answer unhesitatingly that he might ""you do what?""i answer sire that he might "king louis flush with anger and he catch up the tong from the grate with motion as though he would have strike his minister with they madame spring from her chair and lay her hand upon his arm with soothe gesture he throw down the tong again but his eye still flash with passion as he turn they upon louvois "how dare you he cry "but sire how dare you say what you venture to answer such message without consult i how often be to tell you that be the state alone that all be to come from i and that be answerable to god only what be you my instrument my tool and you venture to act without my authority!""i think that know your wish sire stammer louvois whose haughty manner have quite desert he and whose face be as white as the ruffle of his shirt "you be not there to think about my wish sir you be there to consult they and to obey they why be it that have turn away from my old nobility and have commit the affair of my kingdom to man whose name have never be hear of in the history of france such man as colbert and yourself have be blame for it there be the duc de st. simon who say the last time that he be at the court that it be bourgeois government so it be but wish it to be so because know that the noble have way of think for themselves and ask for no thought but mine in the governing of france but if my bourgeois be to receive message and give answer to embassy then indeed be to be pity have mark you of late louvois you have grow beyond your station you take too much upon yourself see to it that have not again to complain to you upon this matter "the humiliate minister sit as one crush with his chin sink upon his breast the king mutter and frown for few minute but the cloud clear gradually from his face for his fit of anger be usually as short as they be fierce and sudden "you will detain that messenger louvois he say at last in calm voice "yes sire ""and we shall see at the council meeting to morrow that fitting reply be send to lord sunderland it would be good perhaps not to be too free with our promise in the matter these english have ever be thorn in our side if we could leave they among their own fog with such quarrel as would keep they busy for few year then indeed we might crush this dutch prince at our leisure their last civil war last ten year and their next may do as much we could carry our frontier to the rhine long ere that eh louvois?""your army be ready sire on the day that you give the word ""but war be costly business do not wish to have to sell the court plate as we do the other day how be the public funds?""we be not very rich sire but there be one way in which money may very readily be gain there be some talk this morning about the huguenots and whether they should dwell any long in this catholic kingdom now if they be drive out and if their property be take by the state then indeed your majesty would at once become the rich monarch in christendom ""but you be against it this morning louvois?""i have not have time to think of it sire ""you mean that father la chaise and the bishop have not have time to get at you say louis sharply ah louvois have not live with court round i all these year without learn how thing be do it be word to he and so on to another and so to third and so to the king when my good father of the church have set themselves to bring anything to pass see trace of they at every turn as one trace mole by the dirt which it have throw up but will not be move against my own reason to do wrong to those who however mistaken they may be be still the subject whom god have give i ""i would not have you do so sire cry louvois in confusion the king 's accusation have be so true that he have be unable at the moment even to protest "i know but one person continue louis glance across at madame de maintenon who have no ambition who desire neither wealth nor preferment and who can therefore never be bribe to sacrifice my interest that be why value that person 's opinion so highly he smile at the lady as he speak while his minister cast glance at she which show the jealousy which eat into his soul "it be my duty to point this out to you sire not as suggestion but as possibility say he rise fear that have already take up too much of your majesty 's time and shall now withdraw bow slightly to the lady and profoundly to the monarch he walk from the room "louvois grow intolerable say the king know not where his insolence will end be it not that he be an excellent servant should have send he from the court before this he have his own opinion upon everything it be but the other day that he would have it that be wrong when say that one of the window in the trianon be small than any of the other it be the same size say he bring le metre with his measure and of course the window be as have say too small but see by your clock that it be four o'clock must go ""my clock sire be half an hour slow ""half an hour the king look dismayed for an instant and then begin to laugh nay in that case say he have well remain where be for it be too late to go and can say with clear conscience that it be the clock 's fault rather than mine ""i trust that it be nothing of very great importance sire say the lady with look of demure triumph in her eye "by no mean ""no state affair?""no no it be only that it be the hour at which have intend to rebuke the conduct of presumptuous person but perhaps it be well as it be my absence will in itself convey my message and in such sort that trust may never see that person 's face more at my court but ah what be this?"the door have be fling open and madame de montespan beautiful and furious be stand before they madame de maintenon be woman who be always full of self restraint and of cool resource she have rise in an instant with an air as if she have at last see the welcome guest for whom she have pine in vain with frank smile of greeting she advance with outstretched hand "this be indeed pleasure say she but madame de montespan be very angry so angry that she be evidently make strong effort to keep herself within control and to avoid break into furious outburst her face be very pale her lip compress and her blue eye have the set stare and the cold glitter of furious woman so for an instant they face each other the one frowning the other smile two of the most beautiful and queenly woman in france then de montespan disregard her rival 's outstretche hand turn towards the king who have be look at she with darkening face "i fear that intrude
