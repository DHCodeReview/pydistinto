madame de maintenon have any message for his majesty he will be for the next few hour in the room of madame de montespan this she address to her rival and it be send on the spot together with the king 's order by the hand of the little black page for nearly week the king be constant to his new humour the routine of his life remain unchanged save that it be the room of the frail beauty rather than of madame de maintenon which attract he in the afternoon and in sympathy with this sudden relapse into his old life his coat lose something of their sombre hue and fawn colour buff colour and lilac begin to replace the black and the blue little gold lace bud out upon his hat also and at the trimming of his pocket while for three day on end hisprie dieuat the royal chapel have be unoccupied his walk be brisker and he give youthful flourish to his cane as defiance to those who have see in his reformation the first symptom of age madame have know her man well when she throw out that artful insinuation and as the king brighten so all the great court brighten too thesalonsbegan to resume their former splendour and gay coat and glitter embroidery which have lain in drawer for year be see

have be long banish the court begin to reappear in the corridor and garden unchecked and unrebuked while the black cassock of the jesuit and the purple soutane of the bishop be less frequent colour in the royal circle but the church party who if they be the champion of bigotry be also those of virtue be never seriously alarm at this relapse the grave eye of priest or of prelate follow louis in his escapade as wary huntsman might watch young deer which gambol about in the meadow under the impression that it be masterless when every gap and path be netted and it be in truth as much in their hand as though it be lying bind before they they know how short time it would be before some ache some pain some chance word would bring his mortality home to he again and envelop he once more in those superstitious terror which take the place of religion in his mind they wait therefore and they silently plan how the prodigal might well be deal with on his return to this end it be that his confessor pere la chaise and bossuet the great bishop of meaux wait one morning upon madame de maintenon in her chamber with globe beside she she be endeavour to teach geography to the lame due du maine and the mischievous little comte de toulouse who have enough of their father 's disposition to make they averse to learning and of their mother 's to cause they to hate any discipline or restraint her
