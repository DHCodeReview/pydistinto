touch upon the real obstacle "my daughter say the jesuit gravely that be matter which you may leave to the church it may be that we too have some power over the king 's mind and that we may lead he in the right path even though those of his own blood would fain have it otherwise the future only can show with whom the power lie but you love and duty both draw you one way now and the church may count

make her resolution you be wise than say she and to you have be commit the interest of the church will do what you advise ""you promise it?""i do "her two visitor throw up their hand together it be blessed day they cry and generation yet unborn will learn to deem it so "she sit half stun by the prospect which be open out in front of she ambitious she have as the jesuit have surmise always be ambitious for the power which would enable she to leave the world well than she find it and this ambition she have already to some extent be able to satisfy for more than once she have sway both king and kingdom but to marry the king to marry the man for whom she would gladly lay down her life whom in the depth of her heart she love in as pure and as noble fashion as woman ever yet love man that be indeed thing above her utmost hope she know her own mind and she know his once his wife she could hold he to good and keep every evil influence away from he she be sure of it she should be no weak maria theresa but rather as the priest have say new jeanne d'arc come to lead france and france 's king into well way and if to gain this aim she have to harden her heart against the huguenots at least the fault if there be one lie with those who make this condition rather than with herself the king 's wife the heart of the woman and the soul of the enthusiast both leap at the thought but close at the heel of her joy there come sudden revulsion to doubt and despondency be not all this fine prospect mere day dream and how could these man be so sure that they hold the king in the hollow of their hand the jesuit read the fear which dull the sparkle of her eye and answer her thought before she have time to put they into word "the church redeem its pledge swiftly say he and you my daughter you must be as prompt when your own turn come ""i have promise father ""then it be for we to perform you will remain in your room all evening ""yes father ""the king already hesitate speak with he this morning and his mind be full of blackness and despair his well self turn in disgust from his sin and it be now when the first hot fit of repentance be just come upon he that he may well be mould to our end have to see and speak with he once more and go from your room to his and when have speak he will come from his room to yours or have study his heart for twenty year in vain we leave you now and you will not see we but you will see the effect of what we do and you will remember your pledge to we they bow low to she both together and leave she to her thought an hour pass and then second one as she sit in herfauteuil her tapestry before she but her hand listless upon her lap wait for her fate her life 's future be now be settle for she and she be powerless to turn it in one way or the other daylight turn to the pearly light of evening and that again to dusk but she still sit wait in the shadow sometimes as step pass in the corridor she would glance expectantly towards the door and the light of welcome would spring up in her gray eye only to die away again into disappointment at last however there come quick sharp tread crisp and authoritative which bring she to her foot with flushed cheek and her heart beat wildly the door open and she see outline against the gray light of the outer passage the erect and graceful figure of the king "sire one instant and mademoiselle will light the lamp ""do not call she he enter and close the door behind he francoise the dusk be welcome to i because it screen i from the reproach which must lie in your glance even if your tongue be too kindly to speak they ""reproaches sire god forbid that should utter them!""when last leave you francoise it be with good resolution in my mind try to carry it out and fail fail remember that you warn i fool that be not to follow your advice!""we be all weak and mortal sire who have not fall nay sire it go to my heart to see you thus "he be stand by the fireplace his face bury in his hand and she could tell by the catch of his breath that he be weep all the pity of her woman 's nature go out to that silent and repent figure dimly see in the fail light she put out her hand with gesture of sympathy and it rest for an instant upon his velvet sleeve the next he have clasp it between his own and she make no effort to release it "i can not do without you francoise he cry be the lonely man in all this world like one who live on great mountain peak with none to bear he company who have for friend whom can rely upon some be for the church some be for their family most be for themselves but who of they all be single minded you be my well self francoise you be my guardian angel what the good father say be true and the nearer be to you the further be from all that be evil tell i francoise do you love me?""i have love you for year sire her voice be low but clear the voice of woman to whom coquetry be abhorrent "i have hope it francoise and yet it thrill i to hear you say it know that wealth and title have no attraction for you and that your heart turn rather towards the convent than the palace yet ask you to remain in the palace and to reign there will you be my wife francoise?"and so the moment have in very truth come she pause for an instant only an instant before take this last great step but even that be too long for the patience of the king "will you not francoise he cry with ring of fear in his voice "may god make i worthy of such an honour sire say she and here swear that if heaven double my life every hour shall be spend in the one endeavour to make you happy man!"she have kneel down and the king still hold her hand kneel down beside she "and swear too he cry that if my day also be double you will now and forever be the one and only woman for i "and so their double oath be take an oath which be to be test in the future for each do live almost double their year and yet neither break the promise make hand in hand on that

shrewdness for which his order be famous have come to the conclusion that publicity be the good mean of hold the king to his present intention but whatever the source it be know all over the court next day that the old favourite be again in disgrace and that there be talk of marriage between the king and the governess of his child it be whisper at thepetit lever confirm at thegrand entree and

burlesque of the monarch "why monsieur you seem less gay than usual to day say the king with smile your dress indeed be bright but your brow be clouded trust that all be well with madame and with the
