choose since her first come to court and wear now as more in keep with her lofty prospect rich yet simple costume of white satin with bow of silver serge single diamond sparkle in the thick coil of her dark tress the change have take year from face and figure which have always look much young than her age and as the two plotter look upon her perfect complexion her regular feature so calm and yet so full of refinement and the exquisite grace of her figure and bearing they could not but feel that if they fail in their end it be not for want of have perfect tool at their command she have rise at their entrance and her expression show that she have read upon their face something of the anxiety which fill their mind "you have evil news she cry "no no my daughter it be the bishop who speak but we must be on our guard against our enemy who would turn the king away from you if they could "her face shine at the mention of her lover "ah you do not know she cry he have make vow would trust he as would trust myself know that he will be true "but the jesuit 's intellect be array against the intuition of the woman "our opponent be many and strong say he shake his head even if the king remain firm he will be annoy at every turn so that he will feel his life be dark instead of light save of course madame for that brightness which you can not fail to bring with you we must bring the matter to an end ""and how father?""the marriage must be at once!""at once!""yes this very night if possible ""oh father you ask too much the king would never consent to such proposal ""it be he that will

morning but now oh it would break my heart!""fear not madame we advise you for the good go to the king now at once say to he that you have hear that he have be subject to much annoyance upon your account that you can not bear to think that you should be cause of dissension in his own family and therefore you will release he from his promise and will withdraw yourself from the court forever ""go now at once?""yes without loss of an instant "she cast light mantle about her shoulder "i follow your advice she say believe that you be wise than i.but oh if he should take i at my word!""he will not take you at your word ""it be terrible risk ""but such an end as this can not be gain without risk go my child and may heaven 's blessing go with you!"the king have remain alone in his

with profound astonishment that he learn from bontems that his friend and companion be include in the order he be eagerly endeavour to whisper into the young american 's ear some precept and warning as to what to do and what to avoid when bontems reappear and usher they into the presence it be with feeling of curiosity not unmixe with awe that amos green to whom governor dongan of new york have
