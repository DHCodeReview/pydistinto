rub his throat tell you that he wasin extremis he can not be far off ""that be true he can not be far off cry de vivonne he have neither horse nor arm you despard and raymond de carnac guard the other that he play we no trick do you latour and you turberville ride down the road and wait by the south gate if he enter paris at all he must come in that way if you get he tie he before you on your horse and bring he to the rendezvous in any case it matter little for he be stranger this fellow and only here by chance now lead the other to the carriage and we shall get away before an alarm be give "the two horseman ride off in pursuit of the fugitive and de catinat still struggle desperately to escape be drag down the st. germain road and thrust into the carriage which have wait at some distance while these incident be be enact three of the horseman ride ahead the coachman be curtly order to follow they and de vivonne having despatch one of the band with note to his sister follow after the coach with the remainder of his desperado the unfortunate guardsman have now entirely recover his sense and find himself with strap round his ankle and another round his wrist captive inside move prison which lumber heavily along the country road he have be stun by the shock of his fall and his leg be badly bruise by the weight of his horse but the cut on his forehead be mere trifle and the bleeding have already cease his mind however pain he more than his body he sink his head into his pinioned hand and stamp madly with his foot rock himself to and fro in his despair what fool treble fool he have be he an old soldier who have see something of war to walk with open eye into such trap the king have choose he of all man as trusty messenger and yet he have fail he and fail he so ignominiously without shot fire or sword draw he be warn too warn by young man who know nothing of court intrigue and who be guide only by the wit which nature have give he de catinat dash himself down upon the leather cushion in the agony of his thought but then come return of that common sense which lie so very closely beneath the impetuosity of the celt the matter be do now and he must see if it could not be mend amos green have escape that be one grand point in his favour and amos green have hear the king 's message and realise its importance it be true that he know nothing of paris but surely man who could pick his way at night through the forest of maine would not be baulk in find so well know house as that of the archbishop of paris but then there come sudden thought which turn de catinat 's heart to lead the city gate be lock at eight o'clock in the evening it be now nearly nine it would have be easy for he whose uniform be voucher for his message to gain his way through but how could amos green foreigner and civilian hope to pass it be impossible clearly impossible and yet somehow in spite of the impossibility he still clung to vague hope that man so full of energy and resource might find some way out of the difficulty and then the thought of escape occur to his mind might he not even now be in time perhaps to carry his own message who be these man who have seize he they have say nothing to give he hint as to whose tool they be monsieur and the dauphin occur to his mind probably one or the other he have only recognise one of they old major despard man who frequent the low wine shop of versailles and whose sword be ever at the disposal of the long purse and where be these people take he to it might be to his death but if they wish to do away with he why should they have bring he back to consciousness and why this carriage and drive full of curiosity he peer out of the window horseman be ride close up on either side but there be glass in front of the carriage and through this he could gain some idea as to his whereabouts the cloud have clear now and the moon be shine brightly bathe the whole wide landscape in its shimmering light to the right lie the open country broad plain with clump of woodland and the tower of castle prick out from above the grove heavy bell be ring in some monastery and its dull booming come and go with the breeze on the left but far away lie the glimmer of paris they be leave it rapidly behind whatever his destination it be neither the capital nor versailles then he begin to count the chance of escape his sword have be remove and his pistol be still in the holster beside his unfortunate horse he be unarmed then even if he could free himself and his captor be at least dozen in number there be three on ahead ride abreast along the white moonlit road then there be one on each side and he should judge by the clatter of hoofs that there could not be few than half dozen behind that would make exactly twelve include the coachman too many surely for an unarmed man to hope to baffle at the thought of the coachman he have glance through the glass front at the broad back of the man and he have suddenly in the glimmer of the carriage lamp observe something which strike he with horror the man be evidently desperately wound it be strange indeed that he could still sit there and flick his whip with so terrible an injury in the back of his great red coat just under the left shoulder blade be gash in the cloth where some weapon have pass and all round be wide patch of dark scarlet which tell its own tale nor be this all as he raise his whip the moonlight shine upon his hand and de catinat see with shudder that it also be splash and clog with blood the guardsman crane his neck to catch glimpse of the man 's face but his broad brim hat be draw low and the high collar of his driving coat be raise so that his feature be in the shadow this silent man in front of he with the horrible mark upon his person send chill to de catinat 's valiant heart and he mutter over one of marot 's huguenot psalm for who but the foul fiend himself would drive coach with those crimson hand and with sword drive through his body?and now they have come to spot where the main road run onwards but small side track wind away down the steep slope of hill and so in the direction of the seine the advance guard have keep to the main road and the two horseman on either side be trot in the same direction when to de catinat 's amazement the carriage suddenly swerve to one side and in an instant plunge down the steep incline the two stout horse gallop at their topmost speed the coachman stand up and lash furiously at they and the clumsy old vehicle bound along in way which throw he backwards and forwards from one seat to the other behind he he could hear shout of consternation from the escort and then the rush of gallop hoofs away they fly the roadside poplar dance past at either window the horse thunder along with their stomach to the earth and that demon driver still wave those horrible red hand in the moonlight and scream out to the madden steed sometimes the carriage jolt one way sometimes another sway furiously and run on two side wheel as though it must every instant go over and yet fast as they go their pursuer go fast still the rattle of their hoofs be at their very back and suddenly at one of the window there come into view the red distend nostril of horse slowly it draw forward the muzzle the eye the ear the mane come into sight as the rider still gain upon they and then above they the fierce face of despard and the gleam of brass pistol barrel "at the horse despard at the horse cry an authoritative voice from behind the pistol flash and the coach lurch over as one of the horse give convulsive spring but the driver still shriek and lash with his whip while the carriage bound onwards but now the road turn sudden curve and there right in front of they not hundred pace away be the seine run cold and still in the moonshine the bank on either side of the highway run straight down without any break to the water 's edge there be no sign of bridge and black shadow in the centre of the stream show where the ferry boat be return after convey some belate traveller across the driver never hesitate but gather up the rein he urge the frightened creature into the river they hesitate however when they first feel the cold water about their hock and even as they do so one of they with low moan fall over upon her side despard 's bullet have find its mark like flash the coachman hurl himself from the box and plunge into the stream but the pursue horseman be all round he before this and half dozen hand have seize he ere he could reach deep water and have drag he to the bank his broad hat have be strike off in the struggle and de catinat see his face in the moonshine great heaven it be amos green the desperado be as much astonish as be de catinat when they find that they have recapture in this extraordinary manner the messenger whom they have give up for lost volley of oath and exclamation break from they as on tear off the huge red coat of the coachman they disclose the sombre dress of the young american "a thousand thunder cry one and this be the man whom that devil 's brat latour would make out to be dead!""and how come he here?""and where be etienne arnaud?""he have stab etienne see the great cut in the coat!""ay and see the colour of his hand he have stab he and take his coat and hat ""what while we be all within stone 's cast!""ay there be no other way out of it ""by my soul cry old despard have never much love for old etienne but have empty cup of wine with he before now and shall see that he have justice let we cast these rein round the fellow 's neck and hang he upon this tree "several pair of hand be already unbuckle the harness of the dead horse when de vivonne push his way into the little group and with few curt word check their intend violence "it be as much as your life be worth to touch he say he "but he have slay etienne arnaud ""that score may be settle afterwards to night he be the king 's messenger be the other all safe?""yes he be here ""tie this man and put he in beside he unbuckle the trace of the dead horse so now de carnac put your own into the harness you can mount the box and drive for we have not very far to go "the change be rapidly make amos green be thrust in beside de catinat and the carriage be soon toil up the steep incline which it have come down so precipitately the american have say not word since his capture and have remain absolutely stolid with his hand cross over his chest whilst his fate be under discussion now that he be alone once more with his comrade however he frown and mutter like man who feel that fortune have use he badly "those infernal horse he grumble why an american horse would have take to the water like duck many time have swum my old stallion sagamore across the hudson once over the river we should have have clear lead to paris ""my dear friend cry de catinat lay his manacled hand upon those of his comrade can you forgive i for speak as do upon the way from versailles?""tut man never give it thought ""you be right thousand time and be as you say fool blind obstinate fool how nobly you have stand by i but how come you there never in my life have be so astonished as when see your face "amos green chuckle to himself think that maybe it would be surprise to you if you know who be drive you say he when be throw from my horse lie quiet partly because want to get grip of my breath and partly because it seem to i to be more healthy to lie than to stand with all those sword clink in my ear then they all get round you and roll into the ditch creep along it get on the cross road in the shadow of the tree and be beside the carriage before ever they know that be go see in flash that there be only one way by which could be of use to you the coachman be lean round with his head turn to see what be go on behind he out with my knife spring up on the front wheel and stop his tongue forever ""what without sound!""i have not live among the indians for nothing ""and then?""i pull he down into the ditch and get into his coat and his hat do not scalp he ""scalp he great heaven such thing be only do among savage ""ah think that maybe it be not the custom of the country be glad now that do not do it have hardly get the rein before they be all back and bundle you into the coach be not afraid of their see i but be scared lest should not know which road to take and so set they on the trail but they make it easy to i by send some of their rider in front so do well until see that by track and make run for it we 'd have get away too if that rogue have n't shoot the horse and if the beast have face the water "the guardsman again press his comrade 's hand you have be as true to i as hilt to blade say he it be bold thought and bold deed ""and what now ask the american "i do not know who these man be and do not know whither they be take we ""to their village likely to burn we "de catinat laugh in spite of his anxiety you will have it that we be back in america again say he they do n't do thing in that way in france ""they seem free enough with hang in france tell you feel like smoke out coon when that trace be round my neck ""i fancy that they be take we to some place where they can shut we up until this business blow over ""well they 'll need to be smart about it ""why?""else maybe they wo n't find we when they want we ""what do you mean?"for answer the american with twist and wriggle draw his two hand apart and hold they in front of his comrade 's face "bless you it be the first thing they teach the papoose in an indian wigwam 've get out of huron 's thong of raw hide before now and it ai n't very likely that stiff stirrup leather will hold i put your hand out with few dexterous twist he loosen de catinat 's bond until he also be able to slip his hand free now for your foot if you 'll put they up they 'll find that we be easy to catch than to hold "but at that moment the carriage begin to slow down and the clank of the hoofs of the rider in front of they die suddenly away peep through the window the prisoner see huge dark building stretching in front of they so high and so broad that the night shroud it in upon every side great archway hang above they and the lamp shine on the rude wooden gate stud with ponderous clamp and nail in the upper part of the door be small square iron grating and through this they could catch glimpse of the gleam of lantern and of bearded face which look out at they de vivonne stand in his stirrup crane his neck up towards the grating so that the two man most interested could hear little of the conversation which follow they see only that the horseman hold gold ring up in the air and that the face above which have begin by shake and frowning be now nod and smile an instant later the head disappear the door swing open upon scream hinge and the carriage drive on into the courtyard beyond leave the escort with the exception of de vivonne outside as the horse pull up knot of rough fellow cluster round and the two prisoner be drag roughly out in the light of the torch which flare around they they could see that they be hem in by high turrete wall upon every side bulky man with bearded face the same whom they have see at the grating be stand in the centre of the group of armed man issue his order "to the upper dungeon simon he cry and see that they have two bundle of straw and loaf of bread until we learn our master 's will ""i know not who your master may be say de catinat but would ask you by what warrant he dare to stop two messenger of the king while travel in his service?""by st. denis if my master play the king trick it will be but tie and tie the stout man answer with grin but no more talk away with they simon and you answer to i for their safe keeping "it be in vain that de catinat rave and threaten invoke the most terrible menace upon all who be concern in detain he two stout knave thrust he from behind and one drag in front force he through narrow gate and along stone flag passage small man in black buckram with bunch of key in one hand and swinge lantern in the other lead the way their ankle have be so tie that they could but take step of foot in length shuffle along they make their way down three successive corridor and through three door each of which be lock and bar behind they then they ascend wind stone stair hollow out in the centre by the foot of generation of prisoner and of jailer and finally they be thrust into small square dungeon and two truss of straw be throw in after they an instant later heavy key turn in the lock and they be leave to their own meditation very grim and dark those meditation be in the case of de catinat stroke of good luck have make he at court and now this other of ill fortune have destroy he it would be in vain that he should plead his own powerlessness he know his royal master well he be man who be munificent when his order be obey and inexorable when they miscarry no excuse avail with he an unlucky man be as abhorrent to he as negligent one in this great crisis the king have trust he with an all important message and that message have not be deliver what could save he now from disgrace and from ruin he care nothing for the dim dungeon in which he find himself nor for the uncertain fate which hang over his head but his heart turn to lead when he think of his blast career and of the triumph of those whose jealousy have be arouse by his rapid promotion there be his people in paris too his sweet adele his old uncle who have be as good as father to he what protector would they have in their trouble now that he have lose the power that might have shield they how long would it be before they be expose once more to the brutality of dalbert and his dragoon he clench his tooth at the thought and throw himself down with groan upon the litter of straw dimly visible in the faint light which stream through the single window but his energetic comrade have yield to no feeling of despondency the instant that the clang of the prison door have assure he that he be safe from interruption he have slip off the bond which hold he and have feel all round the wall and floor to see what manner of place this might be his search have end in the discovery of small fireplace at one corner and of two great clumsy billet of wood which seem to have be leave there to serve as pillow for the prisoner having satisfy himself that the chimney be so small that it be utterly impossible to pass even his head up it he draw the two block of wood over to the window and be able by place one above the other and stand on tiptoe on the high to reach the bar which guard it draw himself up and fix one toe in an inequality of the wall he manage to look out on to the courtyard which they have just quit the carriage and de vivonne be pass out through the gate as he look and he hear moment later the slam of the heavy door and the clatter of hoofs from the troop of horseman outside the seneschal and his retainer have disappear the torch too be go and save for the measured tread of pair of sentinel in the yard twenty foot beneath he all be silent throughout the great castle and very great castle it be even as he hang there with strain hand his eye be run in admiration and amazement over the huge wall in front of he with its fringe of turret and pinnacle and battlement all lie so still and cold in the moonlight strange thought will slip into man 's head at the most unlikely moment he remember suddenly bright summer day over the water when first he have come down from albany and how his father have meet he on the wharf by the hudson and have take he through the water gate to see peter stuyvesant 's house as sign of how great this city be which have pass from the dutch to the english why peter stuyvesant 's house and peter stuyvesant 's bowery villa put together would not make one wing of this huge pile which be itself mere dog kennel beside the mighty palace at versailles he would that his father be here now and then on second thought he would not for it come back to he that he be prisoner in far land and that his sight seeing be be do through the bar of dungeon window the window be large enough to pass his body through if it be not for those bar he shake they and hang his weight upon they but they be as thick as his thumb and firmly weld then get some strong hold for his other foot he support himself by one hand while he pick with his knife at the setting of the iron it be cement as smooth as glass and as hard as marble his knife turn when he try to loosen it but there be still the stone it be sandstone not so very hard if he could cut groove in it he might be able to draw out bar cement and all he spring down to the floor again and be think how he should well set to work when groan draw his attention to his companion "you seem sick friend say he "sick in mind moan the other oh the cursed fool that have be it madden me!""somethe on your mind say amos green sit down upon his billet of wood what be it then?"the guardsman make movement of impatience what be it how can you ask i when you know as well as do the wretched failure of my mission it be the king 's wish that the archbishop should marry they the king 's wish be the law it must be the archbishop or none he should have be at the palace by now ah my god can see the king 's cabinet can see he wait can see madame wait can hear they
