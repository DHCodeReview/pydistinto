speak of the unhappy de catinat he bury his face in his hand once more "i see all that say the american stolidly and see something more ""what then?""i see the archbishop tie they up together ""the archbishop you be rave ""maybe but see he ""he could not be at the palace ""on the contrary he reach the palace about half an hour ago "de catinat spring to his foot at the palace he scream then who give he the message?""i do say amos green if the american have expect to surprise or delight his companion by this curt announcement he be woefully disappointed for de catinat approach he with face which be full of sympathy and trouble and lay his hand caressingly upon his shoulder "my dear friend say he have be selfish and thoughtless have make too much of my own little trouble and too little of what you have go through for i that fall from your horse have shake you more than you think lie down upon this straw and see if little sleep may not tell you that the bishop be there cry amos green impatiently "quite so there be water in this jug and if dip my scarf into it and tie it round your brow man alive do n't you hear i the bishop be there ""he be he be say de catinat soothingly he be most certainly there trust that you have no pain?"the american wave in the air with his knotted fist you think that be craze he cry and by the eternal you be enough to make i so when say that send the bishop mean that see to the job you remember when step back to your friend the major?"it be the soldier 's turn to grow excited now well he cry grip the other 's arm "well when we send scout into the wood if the matter be worth it we send second one at another hour and so one or other come back with his hair on that be the iroquois fashion and good fashion too ""my god believe that you have save me!""you need n't grip on to my arm like fish eagle on trout go back to the major then and ask he when he be in paris to pass by the archbishop 's door ""well well?""i show he this lump of chalk if we 've be there say you 'll see great cross on the left side of the door post if there be no cross then pull the latch and ask the bishop if he 'll come up to the palace as quick as his horse can bring he the major start an hour after we he would be in paris by half past ten the bishop would be in his carriage by eleven and he would reach versailles half an hour ago that be to say about half past twelve by the lord think 've drive he off his head!"it be no wonder that the young woodsman be alarm at the effect of his own announcement his slow and steady nature be incapable of the quick violent variation of the fiery frenchman de catinat who have throw off his bond before he have lain down spin round the cell now wave his arm and his leg with his shadow caper up the wall behind he all distort in the moonlight finally he throw himself into his comrade 's arm with torrent of thank and ejaculation and praise and promise pat he with his hand and hug he to his breast "oh if could but do something for you he exclaim if could do something for you!""you can then lie down on that straw and go to sleep ""and to think that sneer at you oh you have have your revenge!""for the lord 's sake lie down and go to sleep by persuasion and little push he get his delighted companion on to his couch again and heap the straw over he to serve as blanket de catinat be weary out by the excitement of the day and this last great reaction seem to have absorb all his remain strength his lid droop heavily over his eye his head sink deeply into the soft straw and his last remembrance be that the tireless american be seat cross legged in the moonlight work furiously with his long knife upon one of the billet of wood so weary be the young guardsman that it be long past noon and the sun be shine out of cloudless blue sky before he awake for moment envelop as he be in straw and with the rude arch of the dungeon meeting in four rough hewn groining above his head he stare about he in bewilderment then in an instant the doing of the day before his mission the ambuscade his imprisonment all flash back to he and he spring to his foot his comrade who have be doze in the corner jump up also at the first movement with his hand on his knife and sinister glance direct towards the door "oh it be you be it say he think it be the man ""has some one be in then?""yes they bring those two loaf and jug of water just about dawn when be settle down for rest ""and do he say anything?""no it be the little black one ""simon they call he ""the same he lay the thing down and be go think that maybe if he come again we might get he to stop ""how then?""maybe if we get these stirrup leather round his ankle he would not get they off quite as easy as we have do ""and what then?""well he would tell we where we be and what be to be do with we ""pshaw what do it matter since our mission be done?""it may not matter to you there be no accounting for taste but it matter good deal to i be not use to sit in hole like bear in trap wait for what other folk choose to do with i it be new to i find paris pretty close sort of place but it be prairie compare to this it do n't suit man of my habit and be go to come out of it ""there be no help but patience my friend ""i do n't know that 'd get more help out of bar and few peg he open his coat and take out short piece of rust iron and three small thick piece of wood sharpen at one end "where do you get those then?""these be my night 's work the bar be the top one of the grate have job to loosen it but there it be the peg whittle out of that log ""and what be they for?""well you see peg number one go in here where have pick hole between the stone then 've make this other log into mallet and with two crack there it be firm fix so that you can put your weight on it now these two go in the same way into the hole above here so now you see you can stand up there and look out of that window without ask too much of your toe joint try it "de catinat spring up and look eagerly out between the bar "i do not know the place say he shake his head "it may be any one of thirty castle which lie upon the south side of paris and within six or seven league of it which can it be and who have any interest in treat we so would that could see coat of arm which might help we ah there be one yonder in the centre of the mullion of the window but can scarce read it at the distance warrant that your eye be well than mine amos and that you can read what be on yonder escutcheon ""on what?""on the stone slab in the centre window ""yes see it plain enough it look to i like three turkey buzzard sit on barrel of molasse ""three allurion in chief over tower proper maybe those be the arm of the provence de hautevilles but it can not be that they have no chateau within hundred league no can not tell where we be "he be drop back to the floor and put his weight upon the bar to his amazement it come away in his hand "look amos look he cry "ah you 've find it out well do that during the night ""and how with your knife?""no could make no way with my knife but when get the bar out of the grate manage fast 'll put this one back now or some of those folk down below may notice that we have get it loose ""are they all loose?""only the one at present but we 'll get the other two out during the night you can take that bar out and work with it while use my own picker at the other you see the stone be soft and by grind it you soon make groove along which you can slip the bar it will be mighty queer if we ca n't clear road for ourselves before morning ""well but even if we could get out into the courtyard where could we turn to then?""one thing at time friend you might as well stick at the kennebec because you could not see how you would cross the penobscot anyway there be more air in the yard than in here and when the window be clear we shall soon plan out the rest "the two comrade do not dare to do any work during the day for fear they should be surprise by the jailer or observe from without no one come near they but they eat their loaf and drank their water with the appetite of man who have often know what it be to be without even such simple food as that the instant that night fall they be both up upon the peg grind away at the hard stone and tugging at the bar it be rainy night and there be sharp thunder storm but they could see very well while the shadow of the arched window prevent their be see before midnight they have loosen one bar and the other be just begin to give when some slight noise make they turn their head and there be their jailer stand open mouthed in the middle of the cell stare up at they it be de catinat who observe he first and he spring down at he in an instant with his bar but at his movement the man rush for the door and draw it after he just as the american 's tool whiz past his ear and down the passage as the door slam the two comrade look at each other the guardsman shrug his shoulder and the other whistle "it be scarce worth while to go on say de catinat "we may as well be do that as anything else if my picker have be an inch low 'd have have he well maybe he 'll get stroke or break his neck down those stair 've nothing to work with now but few rub with your bar will finish the job ah dear you be right and we be fairly treed!"a great bell have begin to ring in the chateau and there be loud buzz of voice and clatter of foot upon the stone hoarse order be shout and there be the sound of turn key all this come suddenly in the midst of the stillness of the night show only too certainly that the alarm have be give amos green throw himself down in the straw with his hand in his pocket and de catinat lean sulkily against the wall wait for whatever might come to he five minute pass however and yet another five minute without anyone appear the hubbub in the courtyard continue but there be no sound in the corridor which lead to their cell "well 'll have that bar out after all say the american at last rise and step over to the window anyhow we 'll see what all this caterwauling be about he climb up on his peg as he speak and peep out "come up he cry excitedly to his comrade they 've get some other game go on here and they be all deal too busy to bother their head about we "de catinat clamber up beside he and the two stand stare down into the courtyard brazier have be light at each corner and the place be throng with man many of whom carry torch the yellow glare play fitfully over the grim gray wall flicker up sometimes until the high turret shine golden against the black sky and then as the wind catch they die away until they scarce throw glow upon the cheek of their bearer the main gate be open and carriage which have apparently just drive in be stand at small door immediately in front of their window the wheel and side be brown with mud and the two horse be reek and heavy head as though their journey have be both swift and long man wear plume hat and envelop in riding coat have step from the carriage and then turn round have drag second person out after he there be scuffle cry push and the two figure have vanish through the door as it close the carriage drive away the torch and brazier be extinguish the main gate be close once more and all be as quiet as before this sudden interruption "well gasp de catinat be this another king 's messenger they 've got?""there will be lodging for two more here in short time say amosgreen if they only leave we alone this cell wo n't hold we long ""i wonder where that jailer have gone?""he may go where he like as long as he keep away from here give i your bar again this thing be give it wo n't take we long to have it out he set to work furiously try to deepen the groove in the stone through which he hope to drag the staple suddenly he cease and strain his ear "by thunder say he there be some one work on the other side "they both stand listen there be the thud of hammer the rasping of saw and the clatter of wood from the other side of the wall "what can they be doing?""i ca n't think ""can you see them?""they be too near the wall ""i think can manage say de catinat be slight than you he push his head and neck and half of one shoulder through the gap between the bar and there he remain until his friend think that perhaps he have stick and pull at his leg to extricate he he writhe back however without any difficulty "they be build something he whisper "building!""yes there be four of they with lantern ""what can they be build then?""it be shed think can see four socket in the ground and they be fix four upright into they ""well we ca n't get away as long as there be four man just under our window ""impossible ""but we may as well finish our work for all that the gentle scraping of his iron be drown amid the noise which swell ever louder from without the bar loosen at the end and he draw it slowly towards he at that instant however just as he be disengage it round head appear between he and the moonlight head with great shock of tangled hair and woollen cap upon the top of it so astonished be amos green at the sudden apparition that he let go his grip upon the bar which fall outward topple over the edge of the window sill "you great fool shriek voice from below be your finger ever to be thumb then that you should fumble your tool so thousand thunder of heaven you have break my shoulder ""what be it then cry the other my faith pierre if your finger go as fast as your tongue you would be the first joiner in france ""what be it you ape you have drop your tool upon i ""i have drop nothing ""idiot would you have i believe that iron fall from the sky say that you have strike i you foolish clumsy finger lout ""i have not strike you yet cry the other but by the virgin if have more of this will come down the ladder to you!""silence you good for naught say third voice sternly if the work be not do by daybreak there will be heavy reckoning for somebody "and again the steady hammering and sawing go forward the head still pass and repasse its owner walk apparently upon some platform which they have construct beneath their window but never give glance or thought to the black square opening beside he it be early morning and the first cold light be begin to steal over the courtyard before the work be at last finish and the workman have leave then at last the prisoner dare to climb up and to see what it be which have be construct during the night it give they catch of the breath as they look at it it be scaffold there it lie the ill omen platform of dark greasy board newly fasten together but evidently use often before for the same purpose it be buttress up against their wall and extend clear twenty foot out with broad wooden stair lead down from the further side in the centre stand headsman 's block all haggle at the top and smear with rust colour stain "i think it be time that we leave say amos green "our work be all in vain amos say de catinat sadly "whatever our fate may be and this look ill enough we can but submit to it like brave man ""tut man the window be clear let we make rush for it ""it be useless can see line of armed man along the further side of the yard ""a line at this hour!""yes and here come more see at the centre gate now what in the name of heaven be this?"as he speak the door which face they open and singular procession file out first come two dozen footman walk in pair all carry halberd and clothe in the same maroon colour livery after they huge bearded man with his tunic off and the sleeve of his coarse shirt roll up over his elbow stride along with great axe over his left shoulder behind he priest with an open missal patter forth prayer and in his shadow be woman clothe in black her neck bare and black shawl cast over her head and droop in front of her bow face within grip of she walk tall thin fierce face man with harsh red feature and great jutting nose he wear flat velvet cap with single eagle feather fasten into it by diamond clasp which gleam in the morning light but bright as be his gem his dark eye be bright still and sparkle from under his bushy brow with mad brilliancy which bear with it something of menace and of terror his limb jerk as he walk his feature twist and he carry himself like man who strive hard to hold himself in when his whole soul be aflame with exultation behind he again twelve more maroon clothe retainer bring up the rear of this singular procession the woman have falter at the foot of the scaffold but the man behind she have thrust she forward with such force that she stumble over the low step and would have fall have she not clutch at the arm of the priest at the top of the ladder her eye meet the dreadful block and she burst into scream and shrink backwards but again the man thrust she on and two of the follower catch she by either wrist and drag she forwards "oh maurice maurice she scream be not fit to die oh forgive i maurice as you hope for forgiveness yourself maurice maurice she strove to get towards he to clutch at his wrist at his sleeve but he stand with his hand on his sword gaze at she with face which be all wreathe and contort with merriment at the sight of that dreadful mocking face the prayer freeze upon her lip as well pray for mercy to the drop stone or to the rush stream she turn away and throw back the mantle which have shroud her feature "ah sire she cry sire if you could see i now!"and at the cry and at the sight of that fair pale face de catinat look down from the window be stricken as though by dagger for there stand beside the headsman 's block be she who have be the most powerful as well as the witty and the fair of the woman of france none other than francoise de montespan so lately the favourite of the king on the night upon which such strange chance have befall his messenger the king sit alone in his cabinet over his head perfumed lamp hold up by four little fly cupid of crystal who dangle by golden chain from the paint ceiling cast brilliant light upon the chamber which be flash back twenty fold by the mirror upon the wall the ebony and silver furniture the dainty carpet of la savonniere the silk of tours the tapestry of the gobelins the gold work and the delicate chinaware of sevre the good of all that france could produce be centre between these four wall nothing have ever pass through that door which be not masterpiece of its kind and amid all this brilliance the master of it sit his chin rest upon his hand his elbow upon the table with eye which stare vacantly at the wall moody and solemn man but though his dark eye be fix upon the wall they see nothing of it they look rather down the long vista of his own life away to those early year when what we dream and what we do shade so mistily into one another be it dream or be it fact those two man who use to stoop over his baby crib the one with the dark coat and the star upon his breast whom he have be teach to call father and the other one with the long red gown and the little twinkle eye even now after more than forty year that wicked astute powerful face flash up and he see once more old richelieu the great unanointed king of france and then the other cardinal the long lean one who have take his pocket money and have grudge he his food and have dress he in old clothe how well he could recall the day when mazarin have rouge himself for the last time and how the court have dance with joy at the news that he be no more and his mother too how beautiful she be and how masterful could he not remember how bravely she have bear herself during that war in which the power of the great noble have be break and how she have at last lain down to die implore the priest not to stain her cap string with their holy oil and then he think of what he have do himself how he have shorn down his great subject until instead of be like tree among sapling he have be alone far above all other with his shadow cover the whole land then there be his war and his law and his treaty under his care france have overflow her frontier both on the north and on the east and yet have be so weld together internally that she have but one voice with which she speak through he and then there be that line of beautiful face which waver up in front of he there be olympe de mancini whose italian eye have first teach he that there be power which can rule over king her sister too marie de mancini his wife with her dark little sun brown face henrietta of england whose death have first show he the horror which lie in life la valliere montespan fontanges some be dead some be in convent some who have be wicked and beautiful be now only wicked and
