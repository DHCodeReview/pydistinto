and laugh at his own device while she shiver in every limb turn away from his cruel face and glow eye and bury her face in her hand once more she pray god to forgive she for her poor sinful life so they whirl through the night behind the clattering horse the husband and the wife say nothing but with hatred and fear rage in their heart until brazi fire shine down upon they from the angle of keep

the scaffold his keen dark eye take in every detail of the group which await he there de catinat 's face brighten at the sight of he and he be down in an instant beside his stirrup "de brissac!""de

the stable while de brissac with few short sharp order disarm the retainer station his guardsmen all over the castle and arrange for the removal of the lady and for the custody of her husband an hour later the two friend be ride swiftly down the country road inhale the sweet air which seem the fresher for their late experience of the dank foul vapour of their dungeon far behind they little dark pinnacle jut over grove of tree mark the chateau which they have leave while on the extreme horizon to the west there come quick shimmer and sparkle where the level ray of the early sun gleam upon the magnificent palace which be their goal two day after madame de maintenon 's marriage to the king there be hold within the humble wall of her little room meeting which be destine to cause untold misery to many hundred of thousand of people and yet in the wisdom of providence to be an instrument in carry french art and french ingenuity and french sprightliness among those heavy teutonic people who have be the strong and the well ever since for the leaven which they then receive for in history great evil have sometimes arise from virtue and most beneficent result have often follow hard upon crime the time have come when the church be to claim her promise from madame and her pale cheek and sad eye show how vain it have be for she to try and drown the pleading of her tender heart by the argument of the bigot around she she know the huguenots of france who could know they well see that she be herself from their stock and have be bring up in their faith she know their patience their nobility their independence their tenacity what chance be there that they would conform to the king 's wish few great noble might but the other would laugh at the galley the jail or even the gallow when the faith of their father be at stake if their creed be no long tolerate then and if they remain true to it they must either fly from the country or spend live death tugging at an oar or work in chain gang upon the road it be dreadful alternative to present to people who be so numerous that they make small nation in themselves and most dreadful of all that she who be of their own blood should cast her voice against they and yet her promise have be give and now the time have come when it must be redeem the eloquent bishop bossuet be there with louvois the minister of war and the famous jesuit father la chaise each pile argument upon argument to overcome the reluctance of the king beside they stand another priest so thin and so pale that he might have rise from his bed of death but with fierce light burn in his large dark eye and with terrible resolution in his draw brow and in the set of his grim lanky jaw madame bend over her tapestry and weave her coloured silk in silence while the king lean upon his hand and listen with the face of man who know that he be drive and yet can hardly turn against the goad on the low table lie paper with pen and ink beside it it be the order for the revocation and it only need the king 's signature to make it the law of the land "and so father you be of opinion that if stamp out heresy in this fashion shall assure my own salvation in the next world he ask "you will have merit reward ""and you think so too monsieur bishop?""assuredly sire ""and you abbe du chayla?"the emaciate priest speak for the first time tinge of colour creep into his corpse like cheek and more lurid light in his deep set eye "i know not about assure your salvation sire think it would take very much more to do that but there can not be doubt as to your damnation if you do not do it "the king start angrily and frown at the speaker "your word be somewhat more curt than be accustomed to he remark "in such matter it be cruel indeed to leave you in doubt say again that your soul 's fate hang upon the balance heresy be mortal sin thousand of heretic would turn to the church if you do but give the word therefore these thousand of mortal sin be all upon your soul what hope for it then if you do not amend?""my father and my grandfather tolerate they ""then without some special extension of the grace of god your father and your grandfather be burn in hell ""insolent the king spring from his seat "sire will say what hold to be the truth be you fifty time king what care for any man when know that speak for the king of king see be these the limb of one who would shrink from testify to truth with sudden movement he throw back the long sleeve of his gown and shoot out his white fleshless arm the bone be all knotted and bent and screw into the most fantastic shape even louvois the harden man of the court and his two brother priest shudder at the sight of those dreadful limb he raise they above his head and turn his burn eye upwards "heaven have choose i to testify for the faith before now say he hear that blood be want to nourish the young church of siam and so to siam journey they tear i open they crucify i they wrench and split my bone be leave as dead man yet god have breathe the breath of life back into i that may help in this great work of the regeneration of france ""your suffering father say louis resume his seat give you every claim both upon the church and upon i who be its special champion and protector what would you counsel then father in the case of those huguenot who refuse to change?""they would change cry du chayla with draw smile upon his ghastly face they must bend or they must break what matter if they be grind to powder if we can but build up complete church in the land his deep set eye glow with ferocity and be shake one bony hand in savage wrath above his head "the cruelty with which you have be use then have not teach you to be more tender to other ""tender to heretic no sire my own pain have teach i that the world and the flesh be as nothing and that the true charity to another be to capture his soul at all risk to his vile body should have these huguenot soul sire though turn france into shamble to gain they "louis be evidently deeply impressed by the fearless word and the wild earnestness of the speaker he lean his head upon his hand for little time and remain sink in the deep thought "besides sire say pere la chaise softly there would be little need for these strong measure of which the good abbe speak as have already remark to you you be so beloved in your kingdom that the mere assurance that you have express your will upon the subject would be enough to turn they all to the true faith ""i wish that could think so father wish that could think so but what be this?"it be his valet who have half open the door "captain de catinat be here who desire to see you at once sire ""ask the captain to enter ah happy thought seem to have strike he we shall see what love for i will do in such matter for if it be anywhere to be find it must be among my own body servant "the guardsman have arrive that instant from his long ride and leave amos green with the horse he have come on at once all dusty and travel stain to carry his message to the king he enter now and stand with the quiet ease of man who be use to such scene his hand raise in salute "what news captain?""major de brissac bid i tell you sire that he hold the castle ofportillac that the lady be safe and that her husband be prisoner "louis and his wife exchange quick glance of relief "that be well say he by the way captain you have serve i in many way of late and always with success hear louvois that de la salle be dead of the small pox ""he die yesterday sire ""then desire that you make out the vacant commission of major to monsieur de catinat let i be the first to congratulate you major upon your promotion though you will need to exchange the blue coat for the pearl and gray
