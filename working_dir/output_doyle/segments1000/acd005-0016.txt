minute later they be fly on their way and in little more than an hour their steed all reek and foam fleck be pull up outside the high house in the rue st. martin de catinat spring from his saddle and rush upstairs while amos follow in his own leisurely fashion the old huguenot and his beautiful daughter be seat at one side of the great fireplace her hand in his and they spring up together she to

hanger with brass handle be gird to his waist by tarnished leather belt de catinat have be too occupy to take notice of this singular individual but amos green give shout of delight at the sight of he and run forward to greet he the other 's wooden face relax so far as to show two tobacco stain fang and without rise he hold out great red hand of the size and shape of moderate spade "why captain ephraim cry amos in english who ever would have think of find you here de catinat this be my old friend ephraim savage under whose charge come here ""anchor 's apeak lad and the hatch down say the stranger in the peculiar drawl voice which the new englanders have retain from their ancestor the english puritans "and when do you sail?""as soon as your foot be on her deck if providence serve we

godly country can not answer for new york or virginia south of cape cod or of new haven at the furth there be no say what folk will do very sure be that in boston or salem or plymouth she would see the bridewell and he the stock for half as much ah he shake his head and bend his brow at the guilty couple but they and their old relative be far too engross with their own affair to give thought to the puritan seaman de catinat have tell his tale in few short bitter sentence the injustice that have be do to he his dismissal from the king 's service and the ruin which have come upon the huguenots of france adele as be the angel instinct of woman think only of her lover and his misfortune as she listen to his story but the old merchant totter to his foot when he hear of the revocation of the edict and stand with shake limb stare about he in bewilderment "what be to do he cry what be to do be too old to begin my life again ""never fear uncle say de catinat heartily there be other land beyond france ""but not for i no no be too old lord but thy hand be heavy upon thy servant now be the vial open and the carve work of the sanctuary throw down ah what shall do and whither shall turn he wring his hand in his perplexity "what be amiss with he then amos ask the seaman though know nothing of what he say yet can see that he fly distress signal ""he and his must leave the country ephraim ""and why?""because they be protestants and the king will not abide their creed "ephraim savage be across the room in an instant and have enclose the old merchant 's thin hand in his own great knotted fist there be brotherly sympathy in his strong grip and rugged weather stain face which hold up the other 's courage as no word could have do "what be the french for the scarlet woman amos he ask glance over his shoulder tell this man that we shall see he through tell he that we 've get country where he 'll just fit in like bung in barrel tell he that religion be free to all there and not papist nearer than baltimore or the capuchins of the penobscot tell he that if he want to come thegolden rodis wait with her anchor apeak and her cargo aboard tell he what you like so long as you make he come ""then we must come at once say de catinat as he listen to the cordial message which be convey to his uncle to night the order will be out and to morrow it may be too late ""but my business cry the merchant "take what valuable you can and leave the rest well that than lose all and liberty into the bargain "and so at last it be arrange that very night within five minute of the closing of the gate there pass out of paris small party of five three upon horseback and two in closed carriage which bear several weighty box upon the top they be the first leave fly before the hurricane the early of that great multitude who be within the next few month to stream along every road which lead from france find their journey 's end too often in galley dungeon and torture chamber and yet flood over the frontier in number sufficient to change the industry and modify the character of all the neighbouring people like the israelites of old they have be drive from their home at the bidding of an angry king who even while he exile they throw every difficulty in the way of their departure like they too there be none of they who could hope to reach their promise land without grievous wandering penniless friendless and destitute what passage befell these pilgrim in their travel what danger they meet and overcome in the land of the swiss on the rhine among the walloons in england in ireland in berlin and even in far off russia have still to be write this one little group however whom we know we may follow in their venturesome journey and see the chance which befell they upon that great continent which have lain fallow for so long sow only with the weed of humanity but which be now at last about to quicken into such glorious life thank to the early tiding which the guardsman have bring with he his little party be now ahead of the news as they pass through the village of louvier in the early morning they catch glimpse of naked corpse upon dunghill and be tell by grin watchman that it be that of huguenot who have die impenitent but that be common enough occurrence already and do not mean that there have be any change in the law at rouen all be quiet and captain ephraim savage before evening have bring both they and such property as they have save aboard of his brigantine the golden rod it be but little craft some seventy ton burden but at time when so many be put out to sea in open boat prefer the wrath of nature to that of the king it be refuge indeed the same night the seaman draw up his anchor and begin to slowly make his way down the wind river and very slow work it be there be half moon shine and breeze from the east but the stream writhe and twist and turn until sometimes they seem to be sail up rather than down in the long reach they set the yard square and run but often they have to lower their two boat and warp she painfully along tomlinson of salem the mate and six grave tobacco chew new england seamen with their broad palmetto hat tug and strain at the oar amos green de catinat and even the old merchant have to take their spell ere morning when the sailor be need aboard for the handling of the canvas at last however with the early dawn the river broaden out and each bank trend away leave long funnel shape estuary between ephraim savage snuff the air and pace the deck briskly with twinkle in his keen gray eye the wind have fall away but there be still enough to drive they slowly upon their course "where be the gal he ask "she be in my cabin say amos green think that maybe she could manage there until we get across ""where will you sleep yourself then?""tut litter of spruce bough and sheet of birch bark over i have be enough all these year what would ask well than this deck of soft white pine and my blanket?""very good the old man and his nephew he with the blue coat can have the two empty bunk but you must speak to that man amos 'll have no philandering aboard my ship lad no whispering or cuddling or any such foolishness tell he that this ship be just bit break off from boston and he 'll have to put up with boston way until he get off she they 've be good enough for well man than he you give i the french for no philandering and 'll bring he up with round turn when he drift ""it be pity we leave so quick or they might have be marry before we start she be good girl ephraim and he be fine man for all that their way be not the same as our they do n't seem to take life so hard as we and maybe they get more pleasure out of it ""i never heard tell that we be put here to get pleasure out of it say the old puritan shake his head the valley of the shadow of death do n't seem to i to be the kind name one would give to play ground it be trial and chastening that be what it be the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity we be bad from the beginning like stream that run from tamarack swamp and we 've enough to do to get ourselves to right without any fool 's talk about pleasure ""it seem to i to be all mix up say amos like the fat and the lean in bag of pemmican look at that sun just push its edge over the tree and see the pink flush on the cloud and the river like rosy ribbon behind we it be mighty pretty to our eye and very pleasing to we and it would n't be so to my mind if the creator have n't want it to be many time when have lain in the wood in the fall and smoke my pipe and feel how good the tobacco be and how bright the yellow maple be and the purple ash and the red tupelo blaze among the bushwood 've feel that the real fool 's talk be with the man who could doubt that all this be mean to make the world happy for we ""you've be think too much in they wood say ephraim savage gaze at he uneasily do n't let your sail be too great for your boat lad nor trust to your own wisdom your father be from the bay and you be raise from stock that cast the dust of england from their foot rather than bow down to baal keep grip on the word and do n't think beyond it but what be the matter with the old man he do n't seem easy in his mind "the old merchant have be lean over the bulwark look back with draw face and weary eye at the red curve track behind they which mark the path to paris adele have come up now with not thought to spare upon the danger and trouble which lie in front of she as she chafe the old man 's thin cold hand and whisper word of love and comfort into his ear but they have come to the point where the gentle still flow river begin for the first time to throb to the beat of the sea the old man gaze forward with horror at the bowsprit as he see it rise slowly upwards into the air and clung frantically at the rail as it seem to slip away from beneath he "we be always in the hollow of god 's hand he whisper but oh adele it be dreadful thing to feel his finger move under we ""come with i uncle say de catinat pass his arm under that of the old man it be long since you have rest and you adele pray that you will go and sleep my poor darling for it have be weary journey go now to please i and when you wake both france and your trouble will lie behind you "when father and daughter have leave the deck de catinat make his way aft again to where amos green and the captain be stand "i be glad to get they below amos say he for fear that we may have trouble yet ""and how?""you see the white road which run
