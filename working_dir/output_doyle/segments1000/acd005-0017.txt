by the southern bank of the river twice within the last half hour have see horseman spur for dear life along it where the spire and smoke be yonder be honfleur and thither it be that these man go know not who could ride so madly at such an hour unless they be the messenger of the king oh see there be third one!"on the white band which wind among the green meadow black dot could be see which move along with great rapidity vanish behind clump of tree and then reappear again make for the distant city captain savage draw out his glass and gaze at the rider "ay ay say he as he snap it up again it be soldier sure enough can see the glint of the scabbard which he carry on his larboard side think we shall have more wind soon with breeze we can show our heel to anything in french water but galley or an armed boat would overhaul we now "de catinat who though he could speak little english have learn in america to understand it pretty well look anxiously at amos green fear that we shall bring trouble on this good captain say he and that the loss of his cargo and ship may be his reward for having befriend we ask he whether he would not prefer to land we on the north bank with our money we might make our way into the lowlands "ephraim savage look at his passenger with eye which have lose something of their sternness young man say he see that you can understand something of my talk "de catinat nod "i tell you then that be bad man to beat any man that be ever shipmate with i would tell you as much just jam my helm and keep my course as long as god will let i d'ye see?"de catinat again nod though in truth the seaman 's metaphor leave he with but very general sense of his meaning "we're comin abreast of that there town and in ten minute we shall know if there be any trouble wait for we but 'll tell you story as we go that 'll show you what kind man you 've ship with it be ten year ago that speak of when be in thespeedwell sixty ton brig tradin betwixt boston and jamestown goin' south with lumber and skin and fixin 's d'ye see and north again with tobacco and molasse one night blowin half gale from the south'ard we run on reef two mile to the east of cape may and down we go with hole in our bottom like as if she have be spit on the steeple one they honfleur church well in the morning there be washin about nigh out of sight of land clingin on to half the foreyard without sign either of my mate or of wreckage be n't so cold for it be early fall and could get three part of my body on to the spar but be hungry and thirsty and bruise so just take in two hole of my waist belt and put up hymn and have look round for what could see well see more than care for within five pace of i there be great fish as long pretty nigh as the spar that be grippin it be mighty pleasant thing to have your leg in the water and beast like that all ready for nibble at your toe mon dieu cry the french soldier and he have not eat you?"ephraim savage 's little eye twinkle at the reminiscence "i eat he say he "what cry amos "it be mortal fact have jack knife in my pocket same as this one and kick my leg to keep the brute off and whittle away at the spar until 'd get good jagged bit off sharp at each end same as nigger tell i once down delaware way then wait for he and stop kick so he come at i like hawk on chick dee when he turn up his belly jam my left hand with the wood right into his great grinnin mouth and let he have it with my knife between the gill he try to break away then but hold on d'ye see though he take i so deep think 'd never come up again be nigh go when we get to the surface but he be floatin with the white up and twenty hole in his shirt front then get back to my spar for we 'd go long fifty fathom under water and when reach it faint dead away ""and then?""well when come to it be calm and there be the dead shark floatin beside i paddle my spar over to he and get loose few yard of halliard that be hangin from one end of it make clove hitch round his tail d'ye see and get the end of it sling over the spar and fasten so as could n't lose he then set to work and eat he in week right up to his back fin and drink the rain that fall on my coat and when be pick up by thegracieof gloucester be that fat that could scarce climb aboard that be what ephraim savage mean my lad when he say that he be baddish man to beat "whilst the puritan seaman have be detail his reminiscence his eye have keep wander from the cloud to the flap sail and back such wind as there be come in little short puff and the canvas either draw full or be absolutely slack the fleecy shred of cloud above however travel swiftly across the blue sky it be on these that the captain fix his gaze and he watch they like man who be work out problem in his mind they be abreast of honfleur now and about half mile out from it several sloop and brig be lie there in cluster and whole fleet of brown sail fishing boat be tack slowly in yet all be quiet on the curve quay and on the half moon fort over which float the white flag with the goldenfleur de lis the port lie on their quarter now and they be draw away more quickly as the breeze freshen de catinat glancing back have almost make up his mind that their fear be quite groundless when they be bring back in an instant and more urgently than ever round the corner of the mole great dark boat have dash into view ring round with foam from her fly prow and from the ten pair of oar which swing from either side of she dainty white ensign droop over her stern and in her bow the sun 's light be catch by heavy brass carronade she be pack with man and the gleam which twinkle every now and again from amongst they tell that they be armed to the tooth the captain bring his glass to bear upon they and whistle then he glance up at the cloud once more "thirty man say he and they go three pace to our two you sir take your blue coat off this deck or you 'll bring trouble upon we the lord will look after his own if they 'll only keep from foolishness get these hatch off tomlinson so where be jim sturt and hiram jefferson let they stand by to clap they on again when whistle starboard starboard keep she as full as she 'll draw now amos and you tomlinson come here until have word with you "the three stand in consultation upon the poop glance back at their pursuer there could be no doubt that the wind be freshen it blow briskly in their face as they look back but it be not steady yet and the boat be rapidly overhaul they already they could see the face of the marine who sit in the stern and the gleam of the light linstock which the gunner hold in his hand hola cry an officer in excellent english lay she to or we fire""who be you and what do you want shout ephraim savage in voice that might have be hear from the bank "we come in the king 's name and we want party of huguenots from paris who come on board of your vessel at rouen ""brace back the foreyard and lie she to shout the captain drop ladder over the side there and look smart so now we be ready for they "the yard be swing round and the vessel lie quietly rise and fall on the wave the boat dash alongside her brass cannon train upon the brigantine and her squad of marine with their finger upon their trigger ready to open fire they grin and shrug their shoulder when they see that their sole opponent be three unarmed man upon the poop the officer young active fellow with bristle moustache like the whisker of cat be on deck in an instant with his draw sword in his hand "come up two of you he cry you stand here at the head of theladder sergeant throw up rope and you can fix it to this stanchion keep awake down there and be all ready to fire you come with i corporal lemoine who be captain of this ship?""i am sir say ephraim savage submissively "you have three huguenot aboard?""tut tut huguenot be they think they be very anxious to get away but as long as they pay their passage it be no business of mine an old man his daughter and young fellow about your age in some sort of livery ""in uniform sir the uniform of the king 's guard those be the folk have come for ""and you wish to take they back?""most certainly ""poor folk be sorry for they ""and so be but order be order and must be do ""quite so well the old man be in his bunk asleep the maid be in cabin below and the other be sleep down the hold there where we have to put he for there be no room elsewhere ""sleeping you say we have good surprise he ""but think you that you dare do it alone he have no arm it be true but he be well grow young fellow will you not have twenty man up from the boat?"some such thought have pass through the officer 's head but the captain 's remark put he upon his mettle "come with i corporal say he down this ladder you say?""yes down the ladder and straight on he lie between those two cloth bale ephraim savage look up with smile play about the corner of his grim mouth the wind be whistle now in the rigging and the stay of the mast be hum like two harp string amos green lounge beside the french sergeant who guard the end of the rope ladder while tomlinson the mate stand with bucket of water in his hand exchange remark in very bad french with the crew of the boat beneath he the officer make his way slowly down the ladder which lead into the hold and the corporal follow he and have his chest level with the deck when the other have reach the bottom it may have be something in ephraim savage 's face or it may have be the gloom around he which startle the young frenchman but sudden suspicion flash into his mind "up again corporal he shout think that you be good at the top ""and think that you be good down below my friend say the puritan who gather the officer 's meaning from his gesture put the sole of his boot against the man 's chest he give shove which send both he and the ladder crash down on to the officer beneath he as he do so he blow his whistle and in moment the hatch be back in its place and clamp down on each side with iron bar the sergeant have swing round at the sound of the crash but amos green who have wait for the movement throw his arm about he and hurl he overboard into the sea at the same instant the connect rope be sever the foreyard creak back into position again and the bucketful of salt water souse down over the gunner and his gun put out his linstock and wet his priming shower of ball from the marine pipe through the air or rap up against the plank but the boat be toss and jerk in the short choppy wave and to aim be impossible in vain the man tug and strain at their oar while the gunner work like maniac to relight his linstock and to replace his priming the boat have lose its weigh while the brigantine be fly along now with every sail bulging and swell to bursting point crack go the carronade at last and five little slit in the mainsail show that her charge of grape have fly high her second shot leave no trace behind it and at the third she be at the limit of her range half an hour afterwards little dark dot upon the horizon with golden speck at one end of it be all that could be see of the honfleur guard boat wider and wide grow the low lie shore broad and broad be the vast spread of blue water ahead the smoke of havre lie like little cloud upon the northern horizon and captain ephraim savage pace his deck with his face as grim as ever but with dancing light in his gray eye "i know that the lord would look after his own say he complacently we 've get her beak straight now and there be not as much as dab of mud betwixt this and the three hill of boston you 've have too much of these french wine of late amos lad come down and try real boston brewing with double stroke of malt in the mash tub "for two day thegolden rodlay becalm close to the cape la hague with the breton coast extend along the whole of the southern horizon on the third morning however come sharp breeze and they draw rapidly away from land until it be but vague dim line which blend with the cloud bank out there on the wide free ocean with the wind on their cheek and the salt spray pringle upon their lip these hunted folk might well throw off their sorrow and believe that they have leave for ever behind they all token of those strenuous man whose earnest piety have do more harm than frivolity and wickedness could have accomplish and yet even now they could not shake off their trace for the sin of the cottage be bound by the cottage door but that of the palace spread its evil over land and sea "i be frightened about my father amory say adele as they stand together by the shroud and look back at the dim cloud upon the horizon which mark the position of that france which they be never to see again "but he be out of danger now ""out of danger from cruel law but fear that he will never see the promise land ""what do you mean adele my uncle be hale and hearty ""ah amory his very heart root be fasten in the rue st. martin and when they be tear his life be tear also paris and his business they be the world to he ""but he will accustom himself to this new life ""if it only could be so but fear fear that he be over old for such change he say not word of complaint but read upon his face that he be stricken to the heart for hour together he will gaze back at france with the tear run silently down his cheek and his hair have turn from gray to white within the week "de catinat also have notice that the gaunt old huguenot have grow gaunter that the line upon his stern face be deep and that his head fall forward upon his breast as he walk he be about however to suggest that the voyage might restore the merchant 's health when adele give cry of surprise and point out over the port quarter so beautiful be she at the instant with her raven hair blow back by the wind glow of colour strike into her pale cheek by the driving spray her lip part in her excitement and one white hand shade her eye that he stand beside she with all his thought bent upon her grace and her sweetness "look she cry there be something float upon the sea see it upon the crest of wave "he look in the direction in which she point but at first he see nothing the wind be still behind they and brisk sea be run of deep rich green colour with long creamy curling cap to the large wave the breeze would catch these foam crest from time to time and then there would be sharp spatter upon the deck with salt smack upon the lip and pringling in the eye suddenly as he gaze however something black be tilt up upon the sharp summit of one of the sea and swoop out of view again upon the further side it be so far from he that he could make nothing of it but sharp eye than his have catch glance of it amos green have see the girl point and observe what it be which have attract her attention "captain ephraim cry he there be boat on the starboard quarter "the new england seaman whip up his glass and steady it upon the bulwark "ay it be boat say he but an empty one maybe it be be wash off from some ship or go adrift from shore put she hard down mr. tomlinson for it just so happen that be in need of boat at present "half minute later thegolden rodhad swing round and be run swiftly down towards the black spot which still bob and dance upon the wave as they near she they could see that something be project over her side "it be man 's head cry amos green but ephraim savage 's grim face grow grimmer it be man 's foot say he think that you have well take the gal below to the cabin "amid solemn hush they run alongside this lonely craft which hang out so sinister signal within ten yard of she the foreyard be haul aback and they gaze down upon her terrible crew she be little thirteen foot cockle shell very broad for her length and so flat in the bottom that she have be mean evidently for river or lake work huddle together beneath the seat be three folk man in the dress of respectable artisan woman of the same class and little child about year old the boat be half full of water and the woman and child be stretch with their face downward the fair curl of the infant and the dark lock of the mother wash to and fro like water weed upon the surface the man lie with slate colour face his chin cock up towards the sky his eye turn upwards to the white and his mouth wide open show leathern crinkle tongue like rot leaf in the bow all huddle in heap and with single paddle still grasp in his hand there crouch very small man clothe in black an open book lie across his face and one stiff leg jutting upwards with the heel of the foot rest between the rowlock so this strange company swoop and toss upon the long green atlantic roller boat have be lower by thegolden rod and the unfortunate be soon convey upon deck no particle of either food or drink be to be find nor anything save the single paddle and the open bible which lie across the small man 's face man woman and child have all be dead day at the least and so with the short prayer use upon the sea they be bury from the vessel 's side the small man have at first seem also to be lifeless but amos have detect some slight flutter of his heart and the faint haze be leave upon the watch glass which be hold before his mouth wrap in dry blanket he be lay beside the mast and the mate force few drop of rum every few minute between his lip until the little spark of life which still linger in he might be fan to flame meanwhile ephraim savage have order up the two prisoner whom he have entrap at honfleur very foolish they look as they stood blink and wink in the daylight from which they have be so long cut off "very sorry captain say the seaman but either you have to come with we d'ye see or we have to stay with you they be wait for i over at boston and in truth really could n't tarry "the french soldier shrug his shoulder and look around he with lengthening face he and his corporal be limp with sea sickness and as miserable as frenchman be when first he find that france have vanish from his view "which would you prefer to go on with we to america or go back tofrance?""back to france if can find my way oh must get to france again if only to have word with that fool of gunner ""well we empty bucket of water over his linstock and priming d'ye see so maybe he do all he could but there be france where that thickening be over yonder ""i see it see it ah if my foot be only upon it once more ""there be boat beside we and you may take it ""my god what happiness corporal lemoine the boat let we push off at once ""but you need few thing first good lord who ever hear of man push off like that mr. tomlinson just sle keg of water and barrel of meat and of biscuit into this boat hiram jefferson bring two oar aft it be long pull with the wind in your tooth but you 'll be there by to morrow night and the weather be set fair "the two frenchman be soon provide with all that they be likely to require and push off with waving of hat and shout ofbon voyage the foreyard be swing round again and thegolden rodturne she bowsprit for the west for hour glimpse could be catch of the boat dwindle away on the wave top until at last it vanish into the haze and with it vanish the very last link which connect they with the great world which they be leave behind they but whilst these thing have be do the senseless man beneath the mast have twitch his eyelid have draw little gasping breath and then finally have open his eye his skin be like gray parchment draw tightly over his bone and the limb which thrust out from his clothe be those of sickly child yet weak as he be the large black eye with which he look about he be full of dignity and power old catinat have come upon deck and at the sight of the man and of his dress he have run forward and have raise his head reverently and rest it in his own arm "he be one of the faithful he cry he be one of our pastor ah now indeed blessing will be upon our journey!"but the man smile gently and shake his head fear that may not come this journey with you say he for the lord have call i upon further journey of my own have have my summon and be ready be indeed the pastor of the temple at isigny and when we hear the order of the wicked king and two of the faithful with their little one put forth in the hope that we might come to england but on the first day there come wave which sweep away one of our oar and all that be in the boat our bread our keg and we be leave with no hope save in he and then he begin to call we to he one at time first the child and then the woman and then the man until only be leave though feel that my own time be not long but since ye be also of the faithful may not serve you in any way before go?"the merchant shake his head and then suddenly thought flash upon he and he run with joy upon his face and whisper eagerly to amos green amos laugh and strode across to the captain "it 's time say ephraim savage grimly then the whisperer go to
