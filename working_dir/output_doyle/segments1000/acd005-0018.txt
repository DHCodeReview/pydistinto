de catinat he spring in the air and his eye shine with delight and then they go down to adele in her cabin and she start and blush and turn her sweet face away and pat her hair with her hand as woman will when sudden call be make upon she and so since haste be needful and since even there upon the lonely sea there be one come who might at any moment snap their purpose they find themselves in few minute this gallant man and this pure woman kneel hand in hand before the die pastor who raise his thin arm feebly in benediction as he mutter the word which should make they forever one adele have often picture her wedding to herself as what young girl have not often in her dream she have kneel before the altar with amory in the temple of the rue st. martin or sometimes her fancy have take she to some of those small church in the province those little refuge where handful of believer gather together and it be there that her thought have place the crowning act of woman 's life but when have she think of such marriage as this with the white deck sway beneath they the rope hum above their only chorister the gull which scream around they and their wedding hymn the world old anthem which be strike from the wave by the wind and when could she forget the scene the yellow mast and the belly sail the gray draw face and the crack lip of the castaway her father 's gaunt earnest feature as he knelt to support the die minister de catinat in his blue coat already fade and weather stain captain savage with his wooden face turn towards the cloud and amos green with his hand in his pocket and quiet twinkle in his blue eye then behind all the lanky mate and the little group of new england seaman with their palmetto hat and their serious faces!and so it be do amid kindly word in harsh foreign tongue and the shaking of rude hand harden by the rope and the oar de catinat and his wife lean together by the shrouds when all be over and watch the black side as it rise and fall and the green water which race past they "it be all so strange and so new she say our future seem as vague and dark as yonder cloud bank which gather in front of we ""if it rest with i he answer your future will be as merry and bright as the sunlight that glint on the crest of these wave the country that drive we forth lie far behind we but out there be another and fair country and every breath of wind waft we near to it freedom await we there and we bear with we youth and love and what could man or woman ask for more?"so they stand and talk while the shadow deepen into twilight and the first faint gleam of the star break out in the darkening heavens above they but ere those star have wane again one more toiler have find rest aboard thegolden rod and the scatter flock from isigny have find their little pastor once more for three week the wind keep at east or north east always at brisk breeze and freshen sometimes into half gale thegolden rodspe merrily upon her way with every sail drawing alow and aloft so that by the end of the third week amos and ephraim savage be reckon out the hour before they would look upon their native land once more to the old seaman who be use to meet and to part it be small matter but amos who have never be away before be on fire with impatience and would sit smoke for hour with his leg astride the shank of the bowsprit stare ahead at the skyline in the hope that his friend 's reckoning have be wrong and that at any moment he might see the beloved coast line loom up in front of he "it be no use lad say captain ephraim lay his great red hand upon his shoulder they that go down to the sea in ship need power of patience and there be no good eatin your heart out for what you ca n't get ""there be feel of home about the air though amos answer it seem to whistle through your tooth with bite to it that never feel over yonder ah it will take three month of the mohawk valley before feel myself to right ""well say his friend thrust plug of trinidado tobacco into the corner of his cheek 've be on the sea since have hair to my face mostly in the coast trade d'ye see but over the water as well as far as those navigation law would let i except the two year that come ashore for the king philip business when every man that could carry gun be need on the border 've never be three cast of biscuit from salt water and tell you that never know well crossing than the one we have just make ""ay we have come along like buck before forest fire but it be strange to i how you find your way so clearly out here with never track nor trail to guide you it would puzzle i ephraim to find america to say nought of the narrows of new york ""i be somewhat too far to the north amos we have be on or about the fiftieth since we sight cape la hague to morrow we should make land by my reckonin' ""ah to morrow and what will it be mount desert cape cod?long island?""nay lad we be in the latitude of the st. lawrence and be more like to see the arcadia coast then with this wind day should carry we south or two at the most few more such voyage and shall buy myself fair brick house in green lane of north boston where can look down on the bay or on the charles or the mystic and see the ship comin and goin' so would end my life in peace and quiet "all day amos green in spite of his friend 's assurance strain his eye in the fruitless search for land and when at last the darkness fall he go below and lay out his fringed hunting tunic his leather gaiter and his raccoon skin cap which be very much more to his taste than the broadcloth coat in which the dutch mercer of new york have clothe he de catinat have also put on the dark coat of civil life and he and adele be busy prepare all thing for the old man who have fall so weak that there be little which he could do for himself fiddle be scream in the forecastle and half the night through hoarse burst of homely song mingle with the dash of the wave and the whistle of the wind as the new england man in their own grave and stolid fashion make merry over their home coming the mate 's watch that night be from twelve to four and the moon be shine brightly for the first hour of it in the early morning however it cloud over and thegolden rodplunge into one of those dim clammy mist which lie on all that tract of ocean so thick be it that from the poop one could just make out the loom of the foresail but could see nothing of the fore topmast stay sail or the jib the wind be north east with very keen edge to it and the dainty brigantine lie over scud along with her lee rail within hand 's touch of the water it have suddenly turn very cold so cold that the mate stamp up and down the poop and his four seaman shiver together under the shelter of the bulwark and then in moment one of they be up thrust with his forefinger into the air and screaming while huge white wall spring out of the darkness at the very end of the bowsprit and the ship strike with force which snap she two mast like dry reed in wind and change she in an instant to crushed and shapeless heap of spar and wreckage the mate have shoot the length of the poop at the shock and have narrowly escape from the fall mast while of his four man two have be hurl through the huge gap which yawn in the bow while third have dash his head to piece against the stock of the anchor tomlinson stagger forwards to find the whole front part of the vessel drive inward and single seaman sit daze amid splinter spar flap sail and writhe lash cordage it be still as dark as pitch and save the white crest of leaping wave nothing be to be see beyond the side of the vessel the mate be peer round he in despair at the ruin which have come so suddenly upon they when he find captain ephraim at his elbow half clothe but as wooden and as serene as ever "an iceberg say he sniff at the chill air do you not smell it friend tomlinson?""truly find it cold captain savage but set it down to the mist ""there be mist ever set around they though the lord in his wisdom know well why for it be sore trial to poor sailor man she make water fast mr. tomlinson she be down by the bow already "the other watch have swarm upon deck and one of they be measure the well there be three foot of water he cry and the pump suck dry yesterday at sundown ""hiram jefferson and john moreton to the pump cry the captain mr. tomlinson clear away the long boat and let we see if we may set she right though fear that she be past mend ""the long boat have stove two plank cry seaman "the jolly boat then?""she be in three piece "the mate tear his hair but ephraim savage smile like man who be gently tickle by some coincidence "where be amos green?""here captain ephraim what can do?""and ask de catinat eagerly adele and her father have be wrap in mantle and place for shelter in the lee of the round house "tell he he can take his spell at the pump say the captain to amos and you amos you be handy man with tool get into yonder long boat with lantern and see if you can not patch she up "for half an hour amos green hammer and trim and caulk while the sharp measured clanking of the pump sound above the dash of the sea slowly very slowly the bow of the brigantine be settle down and her stern cock up "you've not much time amos lad say the captain quietly "she'll float now though she be not quite water tight ""very good lower away keep up the pump in there mr. tomlinson see that provision and water be ready as much as she will hold come with i hiram jefferson "the seaman and the captain swing themselves down into the tossing boat the latter with lantern strapped to his waist together they make their way until they be under her mangle bow the captain shake his head when he see the extent of the damage "cut away the foresail and pass it over say he tomlinson and amos green cut away the lashing with their knife and lower the corner of the sail captain ephraim and the seaman seize it and drag it across the mouth of the huge gape leak as he stoop to do it however the ship heave up upon swell and the captain see in the yellow light of his lantern sinuous black crack which radiate away backwards from the central hole "how much in the well he ask "five and half foot ""then the ship be lose could put my finger between her plank as far as can see back keep the pump go there have you the food and water mr. tomlinson?""here sir ""lower they over the bow this boat can not live more than an hour or two can you see anything of the berg?""the fog be lift on the starboard quarter cry one of the man "yes there be the berg quarter of mile to leeward!"the mist have thin away suddenly and the moon glimmer through once more upon the great lonely sea and the stricken ship there like huge sail be the monster piece of ice upon which they have shatter themselves rock slowly to and fro with the wash of the wave "you must make for she say captain ephraim there be no other chance lower the gal over the bow well then her father first if she like it well tell they to sit still amos and that the lord will bear we up if we keep clear of foolishness so you be brave lass for all your niminy piminy lingo now the keg and the barrel and all the wrap and cloak you can find now the other man the frenchman ay ay passenger first and you have get to come now amos now the seamen and you last friend tomlinson "it be well that they have not very far to go for the boat be weigh down almost to the edge and it take the baling of two man to keep in check the water which leak in between the shatter plank when all be safely in their place captain ephraim savage swing himself aboard again which be but too easy now that every minute bring the bow near to the water he come back with bundle of clothing which he throw into the boat "push off he cry "jump in then ""ephraim savage go down with his ship say he quietly friendtomlinson it be not my way to give my order more than once push off say!"the mate thrust she out with boat hook amos and de catinat give cry of dismay but the stolid new englanders settle down to their oar and pull off for the iceberg "amos amos will you suffer it cry the guardsman in french my honour will not permit i to leave he thus should feel it stain for ever ""tomlinson you would not leave he go on board and force he to come ""the man be not live who could force he to do what he have no mind for ""he may change his purpose ""he never change his purpose ""but you can not leave he man you must at least lie by and pick he up ""the boat leak like sieve say the mate will take she to the berg leave you all there if we can find footing and go back for the captain put your heart into it my lad for the soon we be there the soon we shall get back "but they have not take fifty stroke before adele give sudden scream "my god she cry the ship be go down!"she have settle low and low in the water and suddenly with sound of rend plank she thrust down her bow like diving water fowl her stern fly up into the air and with long suck noise she shoot down swifter and swifter until the leap wave close over her high poop lantern with one impulse the boat sweep round again and make backwards as fast as willing arm could pull it but all be quiet at the scene of the disaster not even fragment of wreckage be leave upon the surface to show where thegolden rodhad find her last harbour for long quarter of an hour they pull round and round in the moonlight but not glimpse could they see of the puritan seaman and at last when in spite of the baler the water be wash round their ankle they put her head about once more and make their way in silence and with heavy heart to their dreary island of refuge desolate as it be it be their only hope now for the leak be increase and it be evident that the boat could not be keep afloat long as they draw near they see with dismay that the side which face they be solid wall of ice sixty foot high without flaw or crevice in its whole extent the berg be large one fifty pace at least each way and there be hope that the other side might be more favourable bale hard they paddle round the corner but only to find themselves face by another gloomy ice crag again they go round and again they find that the berg increase rather than diminish in height there remain only one other side and they know as they row round to it that their life hang upon the result for the boat be almost settle down beneath they they shoot out from the shadow into the full moonlight and look upon sight which none of they would forget until their die day the cliff which face they be as precipitous as any of the other and it glimmer and sparkle all over where the silver light fall upon the thousand facet of ice right in the centre however on level with the water 's edge there be what appear to be huge hollow out cave which mark the spot where the golden rod have in shatter herself dislodge huge boulder and so amid her own ruin prepare refuge for those who have trust themselves to she this cavern be of the rich emerald green light and clear at the edge but tone away into the deep purple and blue at the back but it be not the beauty of this grotto nor be it the assurance of rescue which bring cry of joy and of wonder from every lip but it be that seat upon an ice boulder and placidly smoke long corn cob pipe there be perch in front of they no less person than captain ephraim savage of boston for moment the castaway could almost have believe that it be his wraith be wraith ever see in so homely an attitude but the tone of his voice very soon show that it be indeed he and in no very christian temper either "friend tomlinson say he when tell you to row for an iceberg mean you to row right away there d'ye see and not to go philander about over the ocean it be not your fault that be not freeze and so would have be if have n't some dry tobacco and my tinder box to keep myself warm "without stop to answer his commander 's reproach the mate head for the ledge which have be cut into slope by the bow of the brigantine so that the boat be run up easily on to the ice captain savage seize his dry clothe and vanish into the back of the cave to return presently warm in body and more contented in mind the long boat have be turn upside down for seat the grating and thwart take out and cover with wrap to make couch for the lady and the head knock out of the keg of biscuit "we be frightened for you ephraim say amos green have heavy heart this night when think that should never see you more ""tut amos you should have know i well ""but how come you here captain ask tomlinson think that maybe you have be take down by the suck of the ship ""and so be it be the third ship in which have go down but they have never keep i down yet go deep to night than when thespeedwellsank but not so deep as in thegovernor winthrop when come up swam to the berg find this nook and crawl in glad be to see you for fear that you have founder ""we put back to pick you up and we pass you in the darkness and what should we do now?""rig up that boat sail and make quarter for the gal then get our supper and such rest as we can for there be nothing to be do to night and there may be much in the morning "amos green be arouse in the morning by hand upon his shoulder and spring to his foot find de catinat stand beside he the survivor of the crew be group about the upturned boat slumber heavily after their labour of the night the red rim of the sun have just push itself above the water line and sky and sea be one blaze of scarlet and orange from the dazzle gold of the horizon to the light pink at the zenith the first ray flash directly into their cave sparkle and glimmer upon the ice crystal and tinge the whole grotto with rich warm light never be fairy 's palace more lovely than this float refuge which nature have provide for they but neither the american nor the frenchman have time now to give thought to the novelty and beauty of their situation the latter 's face be grave and his friend read danger in his eye "what be it then?""the berg it be come to piece ""tut man it be as solid as an island ""i have be watch it you see that crack which extend backwards from the end of our grotto two hour ago could scarce put my hand into it now can slip through it with ease tell you that she be split across "amos green walk to the end of the funnel shape recess and find as his friend have say that green sinuous crack extend away backwards into the iceberg cause either by the tossing of the wave or by the terrific impact of their vessel he rouse captain ephraim and point out the danger to he "well if she spring leak we be go say he she be be thaw pretty fast as it be "they could see now that what have seem in the moonlight to be smooth wall of ice be really furrow and wrinkle like an old man 's face by the stream of melt water which be continually run down they the whole huge mass be brittle and honeycomb and rotten already they could hear all round they the ominous drip drip and the splash and tinkle of the little rivulet as they fall into the ocean "hullo cry amos green what be that?""what then?""did you hear nothing?""no ""i could have swear that hear voice ""impossible we be all here ""it must have be my fancy then "captain ephraim walk to the seaward face of the cave and sweep the ocean with his eye the wind have quite fall away now and the sea stretch away to the eastward smooth and unbroken save for single great black spar which float near the spot where thegolden rodhad founder "we should lie in the track of some ship say the captain thoughtfully there be the codder and the herring bus we be over far south for they reckon but we ca n't be more'n two hundred mile from port royal in arcadia and we be in the line of the st. lawrence trade if have three white mountain pine amos and hundred yard of stout canvas 'd get up on the top of this thing d'ye see and 'd rig such jury mast as would send she humming into boston bay then 'd break she up and sell she for what she be worth and turn few piece over the business but she be heavy old craft and that be fact though even now she might do knot or two an hour if she have hurricane behind she but what be it amos?"the young hunter be stand with his ear slant his head bend forwards and his eye glance sideways like man who listen intently he be about to answer when de catinat give cry and point to the back of the cave "look at the crack now "it have widen by foot since they have notice it last until it be now no long crack it be pass "let we go through say the captain "it can but come out on the other side ""then let we see the other side "he lead the way and the other two follow he it be very dark as they advance with high dripping ice wall on either side and one little zigzag slit of blue sky above their head tripping and grope their way they stumble along until suddenly the passage grow wide and open out into large square of flat ice the berg be level in the centre and slope upwards from that point to the high cliff which bound it on each side in three direction this slope be very steep but in one it slant up quite gradually and the constant thawing have groove the surface with thousand irregularity by which an active man could ascend with one impulse they begin all three to clamber up until minute later they be stand not far from the edge of the summit seventy foot above the sea with view which take in good fifty mile of water in all that fifty mile there be
