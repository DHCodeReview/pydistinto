think over every possible mean by which they might be able to get away from this cursed ship but even if they get away where could they go to then all canada be seal to they the wood to the south be full of ferocious indians the english settlement would it be true grant they freedom to use their own religion but what would his wife and he do without friend stranger among folk who speak another tongue have amos green remain true to they then indeed all would have be well but he have desert they of course there be no reason why he should not he be no blood relation of theirs he have already benefit they many time his own people and the life that he love be wait for he at home why should he linger here for the sake of folk whom he have know but few month it be not to be expect and yet de catinat could not realise it could not understand it but what be that above the gentle lapping of the river he have suddenly hear sharp clear hist perhaps it be some pass boatman or indian then it come again that eager urgent summon he sit up and stare about he it certainly must have come from the open port hole he look out but only to see the broad basin with the loom of the shipping and the distant twinkle from the light on point levi as his head drop back upon the pillow something fall upon his chest with little tap and roll off rattle along the board he spring up catch lantern from hook and flash it upon the floor there be the missile which have strike he little golden brooch as he lift it up and look close at it thrill pass through he it have be his own and he have give it to amos green upon the second day that he have meet he when they be start together for versailles this be signal then and amos green have not desert they after all he dress himself all in tremble with excitement and go upon deck it be pitch dark and he could see no one but the sound of regular footfall somewhere in the fore part of the ship show that the sentinel be still there the guardsman walk over to the side and peer down into the darkness he could see the loom of boat "who be there he whisper "is that you de catinat?"yes ""we have come for you ""god bless you amos ""is your wife there?""no but can rouse she ""good but first catch this cord now pull up the ladder!"de catinat grip the line which be throw to he and on draw it up find that it be attach to rope ladder furnish at the top with two steel hook to catch on to the bulwark he place they in position and then make his way very softly to the cabin amidship in the lady quarter which have be allot to his wife she be the only woman aboard the ship now so that he be able to tap at her door in safety and to explain in few word the need for haste and for secrecy in ten minute adele have dress and with her valuable in little bundle have slip out from her cabin together they make their way upon deck once more and creep aft under the shadow of the bulwark they be almost there when de catinat stop suddenly and ground out an oath through his clenched tooth between they and the rope ladder there be stand in dim patch of murky light the grim figure of franciscan friar he be peer through the darkness his heavy cowl shadow his face and he advance slowly as if he have catch glimpse of they lantern hang from the mizzen shrouds above he he unfasten it and hold it up to cast its light upon they but de catinat be not man with whom it be safe to trifle his life have be one of quick resolve and prompt action be this vindictive friar at the last moment to stand between he and freedom it be dangerous position to take the guardsman pull adele into the shadow of the mast and then as the monk advance he spring out upon he and seize he by the gown as he do so the other 's cowl be push back and instead of the harsh feature of the ecclesiastic de catinat see with amazement in the glimmer of the lantern the shrewd gray eye and strong tern face of ephraim savage at the same instant another figure appear over the side and the warm hearted frenchman throw himself into the arm of amos green "it be all right say the young hunter disengage himself with some embarrassment from the other 's embrace "we've get he in the boat with buckskin glove jam into his gullet!""who then?""the man whose cloak captain ephraim there have put round he he come on we when you be away rouse your lady but we get he to be quiet between we be the lady there?""here she be ""as quick as you can then for some one may come along "adele be help over the side and seat in the stern of birch bark canoe the three man unhook the ladder and swing themselves down by rope while two indians who hold the paddle push silently off from the ship 's side and shoot swiftly up the stream minute later dim loom behind they and the glimmer of two yellow light be all that they could see of thest christophe ."take paddle amos and 'll take one say captain savage strip off his monk 's gown feel safe in this on the deck of yon ship but it do n't help in boat believe we might have fasten the hatch and take she brass gun and all have we be so minded ""and be hang as pirate at the yard arm next morning say amos "i think we have do well to take the honey and leave the tree hope madame that all be well with you ""nay can hardly understand what have happen or where we be ""nor can amos ""did you not expect we to come back for you then?""i do not know what to expect ""well now but surely you could not think that we would leave you without word ""i confes that be cut to the heart by it ""i fear that you be when look at you with the tail of my eye and see you stare so blackly over the bulwark at we but if we have be see talk or plan they would have be upon our trail at once as it be they have not thought of suspicion save only this fellow whom we have in the bottom of the boat here ""and what do you do?""we leave the brig last night get ashore on the beaupre side arrange for this canoe and lie dark all day then to night we get alongside and rouse you easily for know where you sleep the friar nearly spoil all when you be below but we gag he and pass he over the side ephraim pop on his gown so that he might go forward to help you without danger for we be scared at the delay ""ah it be glorious to be free once more what do not owe you amos?""well you look after i when be in your country and be go to look after you now ""and where be we going?""ah there you have i it be this way or none for we ca n't get down to the sea we must make our way over land as well we can and we must leave good stretch between quebec citadel and we before the day break for from what hear they would rather have huguenot prisoner than an iroquois sagamore by the eternal can not see why they should make such fuss over how man choose to save his own soul though here be old ephraim just as fierce upon the other side so all the folly be not one way ""what be you say about i ask the seaman prick up his ear at the mention of his own name "only that you be good stiff old protestant ""yes thank god my motto be freedom to conscience d'ye see except just for quakers and papist and and would n't stand anne hutchinsons and woman testify and suchlike foolishness "amos green laugh the almighty seem to pass it over so why should you take it to heart say he "ah you be young and callow yet you 'll live to know well why shall hear you say good word soon even for such unclean spawn as this prod the prostrate friar with the handle of his paddle "i daresay he be good man accordin to his light ""and daresay shark be good fish accordin to its light no lad you wo n't mix up light and dark for i in that sort of fashion you may talk until you unship your jaw d'ye see but you will never talk foul wind into fair one pass over the pouch and the tinder box and maybe our friend here will take turn at my paddle "all night they toil up the great river strain every nerve to place themselves beyond the reach of pursuit by keep well into the southern bank and so avoid the force of the current they speed swiftly along for both amos and de catinat be practise hand with the paddle and the two indians work as though they be wire and whipcord instead of flesh and blood an utter silence reign over all the broad stream break only by the lap lap of the water against their curving bow the whirring of the night hawk above they and the sharp high barking of fox away in the wood when at last morning break and the black shade imperceptibly into gray they be far out of sight of the citadel and of all trace of man 's handiwork virgin wood in their wonderful many coloured autumn dress flow right down to the river edge on either side and in the centre be little island with rim of yellow sand and an out flame of scarlet tupelo and sumach in one bright tangle of colour in the centre "i've pass here before say de catinat remember mark that great maple with the blaze on its trunk when last go with the governor to montreal that be in frontenac 's day when the king be first and the bishop second "the redskins who have sit like terra cotta figure without trace of expression upon their set hard face prick up their ear at the sound of that name "my brother have speak of the great onontio say one of they glance round we have listen to the whistling of evil bird who tell we that he will never come back to his child across the sea ""he be with the great white father answer de catinat have myself see he in his council and he will assuredly come across the great water if his people have need of he "the indian shake his shaven head "the rut month be past my brother say he speak in broken french but ere the month of the bird lay have come there will be no white man upon this river save only behind stone wall ""what then we have hear little have the iroquois break out so fiercely?""my brother they say they would eat up the hurons and where be the hurons now they turn their face upon the eries and where be the eries now they go westward against the illinois and who can find an illinois village they raise the hatchet against the andastes and their name be blot from the earth and now they have dance dance and sing song which will bring little good to my white brother ""where be they then?"the indian wave his hand along the whole southern and western horizon "where be they not the wood be rustle with they they be like fire among dry grass so swift and so terrible!""on my life say de catinat if these devil be indeed unchained they will need old frontenac back if they be not to be sweep into the river ""ay say amos see he once when be bring before he with the other for trading on what he call french ground his mouth set like skunk trap and he look at we as if he would have like our scalp for his legging but could see that he be chief and brave man ""he be an enemy of the church and the right hand of the foul fiend in this country say voice from the bottom of the canoe it be the friar who have succeed in getting rid of the buckskin glove and belt with which the two americans have gag he he be lying huddle up now glare savagely at the party with his fiery dark eye "his jaw tackle have come adrift say the seaman let i brace it up again ""nay why should we take he far ask amos he be but weight for we to carry and can not see that we profit by his company let we put he out ""ay sink or swim cry old ephraim with enthusiasm "nay upon the bank ""and have he maybe in front of we warn the black jacket ""on that island then ""very good he can hail the first of his folk who pass "they shoot over to the island and land the friar who say nothing but curse they with his eye they leave with he small supply of biscuit and of flour to last he until he should be pick up then having pass bend in the river they run their canoe ashore in little cove where the whortleberry and cranberry bush grow right down to the water 's edge and the sward be bright with the white euphorbia the blue gentian and the purple balm there they lay out their small stock of provision and eat hearty breakfast while discuss what their plan should be for the future they be not badly provide for their journey the captain of the gloucester brig in which the americans have start from quebec know ephraim savage well as who do not upon the new england coast he have accept his bill therefore at three month date at as high rate of interest as he could screw out of he and he have let he have in return three excellent gun good supply of ammunition and enough money to provide for all his want in this way he have hire the canoe and the indians and have fit she with meat and biscuit to last they for ten day at the least "it be like the breath of life to i to feel the heft of gun and to smell the tree round i say amos why it can not be more than hundred league from here to albany or schenectady right through the forest ""ay lad but how be the gal to walk hundred league through forest?no no let we keep water under our keel and lean on the lord ""then there be only one way for it we must make the richelieu river and keep right along to lake champlain and lake st. sacrament there we should be close by the headwater of the hudson ""it be dangerous road say de catinat who understand the conversation of his companion even when he be unable to join in it we should need to skirt the country of the mohawks ""it be the only way guess it be that or nothing ""and have friend upon the richelieu river who be sure would help we on our way say de catinat with smile adele you have hear i talk of charles de la noue seigneur de sainte marie?""he whom you use to call the canadian duke amory?""precisely his seigneury lie on the richelieu little south of fortst louis and be sure that he would speed we upon our way ""good cry amos if we have friend there we shall do well that clench it then and we shall hold fast by the river let 's get to our paddle then for that friar will make mischief for we if he can "and so for long week the little party toil up the great waterway keep ever to the southern bank where there be few clearing on both side of the stream the wood be thick but every here and there they would curve away and narrow strip of cultivate land would skirt the bank with the yellow stubble to mark where the wheat have grow adele look with interest at the wooden house with their jutting story and quaint gable end at the solid stone build manor house of the seigneur and at the mill in every hamlet which serve the double purpose of grind flour and of loop hole place of retreat in case of attack horrible experience have teach the canadians what the english settler have yet to learn that in land of savage it be folly to place isolate farmhouse in the centre of their own field the clearing then radiate out from the village and every cottage be build with an eye to the military necessity of the whole so that the defence might make stand at all point and might finally centre upon the stone manor house and the mill now at every bluff and hill near the village might be see the gleam of the musket of the watcher for it be know that the scalp party of the five nations be out and none could tell where the blow would fall save that it must come where they be least prepared to meet it indeed at every step in this country whether the traveller be on the st. lawrence or west upon the lake or down upon the bank of the mississippi or south in the country of the cherokees and of the creeks he would still find the inhabitant in the same state of dreadful expectancy and from the same cause the iroquois as they be name by the french or the five nations as they call themselves hang like cloud over the whole great continent their confederation be natural one for they be of the same stock and speak the same language and all attempt to separate they have be in vain mohawks cayugas onondagas oneidas and senecas be each proud of their own totem and their own chief but in war they be iroquois and the enemy of one be the enemy of all their number be small for they be never able to put two thousand warrior in the field and their country be limit for their village be scatter over the tract which lie between lake champlain and lake ontario but they be united they be cunning they be desperately brave and they be fiercely aggressive and energetic hold central position they strike out upon each side in turn never content with simply defeat an adversary but absolutely annihilate and destroy he while hold all the other in check by their diplomacy war be their business and cruelty their amusement one by one they have turn their arm against the various nation until for space of over thousand square mile none exist save by sufferance they have sweep away hurons and huron mission in one fearful massacre they have destroy the tribe of the north west until even the distant sacs and foxes tremble at their name they have scour the whole country to westward until their scalp party have come into touch with their kinsman the sioux who be lord of the great plain even as they be of the great forest the new england indians in the east and the shawnees and delawares far south pay tribute to they and the terror of their arm have extend over the border of maryland and virginia never perhaps in the world 's history have so small body of man dominate so large district and for so long time for half century these tribe have nurse grudge ward the french since champlain and some of his follower have take part with their enemy against they during all these year they have brood in their forest village flash out now and again in some border outrage but wait for the most part until their chance should come and now it seem to they that it have come they have destroy all the tribe who might have ally themselves with the white man they have isolate they they have supply themselves with good gun and plenty of ammunition from the dutch and english of new york the long thin line of french settlement lie naked before they they be gather in the wood like hound in leash wait for the order of their chief which should precipitate they with torch and with tomahawk upon the belt of village such be the situation as the little party of refugee paddle along the bank of the river seek the only path which could lead they to peace and to freedom yet it be as they well know dangerous road to follow all down the richelieu river be the outpost and blockhouse of the french for when the feudal system be graft upon canada the various seigneur or nativenoblessewere assign their estate in the position which would be of most benefit to the settlement each seigneur with his tenant under he train as they be in the use of arm form military force exactly as they have do in the middle age the farmer hold his fief upon condition that he muster when call upon to do so hence the old officer of the regiment of carignan and the more hardy of the settler have be place along the line of the richelieu which run at right angle to the st. lawrence towards the mohawk country the blockhouse themselves might hold their own but to the little party who have to travel down from one to the other the situation be full of deadly peril it be true that the iroquois be not at war with the english but they would discriminate little when on the warpath and the americans even have they wish to do so could not separate their fate from that of their two french companion as they ascend the st. lawrence they meet many canoe come down sometimes it be an officer or an official on his way to the capital from three rivers or montreal sometimes it be load of skin with indians orcoureurs de boisconveye they down to be ship to europe and sometimes it be small canoe which bear sunburned grizzly haired man with rusty weather stain black cassock who zigzag from bank to bank stop at every indian hut upon his way if aught be amiss with the church in canada the fault lie not with man like these village priest who toil and work and spend their very life in bear comfort and hope and little touch of refinement too through all those wild more than once these wayfarer wish to have speech with the fugitive but they push onwards disregard their sign and hail from below nothing overtook they for they paddle from early morning until late at night draw up the canoe when they halt and build fire of dry wood for already the nip of the come winter be in the air it be not only the people and their dwelling which be stretch out before the wonder eye of the french girl as she sit day after day in the stern of the canoe her husband and amos green teach she also to take notice of the sight of the woodland and as they skirt the bank they point out thousand thing which her own sense would never have discern sometimes it be the furry face of raccoon peep out from some tree cleft or an otter swimming under the overhang brushwood with the gleam of white fish in its mouth or perhaps it be the wild cat crouch along branch with its wicked yellow eye fix upon the squirrel which play at the farther end or else with scuttle and rush the canadian porcupine would thrust its way among the yellow blossom of the resin weed and the tangle of the whortleberry bush she learn too to recognise the pert sharp cry of the tiny chick dee the call of the blue bird and the flash of its wing amid the foliage the sweet chirpy note of the black and white bobolink and the long draw mewing of the cat bird on the breast of the broad blue river with nature 's sweet concert ever sound from the bank and with every colour that artist could devise spread out before her eye on the foliage of the die wood the smile come back to her lip and her cheek take glow of health which france have never be able to give de catinat see the change in she but her presence weigh he down with fear for he know that while nature have make these wood heaven
