limb like the wild deer go forward through the wood and see that all be well before you venture "and so it be at last agree and adele still protest be consign to the care of the lady of sainte marie while de catinat swear that without pause he would return from poitou to fetch she the old nobleman and his son would fain have join they in their adventure but they have their own charge to watch and the life of many in their keeping while small party be safe in the wood than large one would be the seigneur provide they with letter for de lannes the governor of the poitou blockhouse and so in the early dawn the four of they creep like shadow from the stockade gate amid the muttered good wish of the guard within and be lose in an instant in the blackness of the vast forest from la noue to poitou be but twelve mile down the river but by the woodland route where creek be to be cross reed girt lake to be avoid and path to be pick among swamp where the wild rice grow high than their head and the alder bush lie in dense clump before they the distance be more than double they walk in single file du lhut leading with the swift silent tread of some wild creature his body bend forward his gun ready in the bend of his arm and his keen dark eye shoot little glance to right and leave observe everything from the tiny mark upon the ground or tree trunk to the motion of every beast and bird of the brushwood de catinat walk behind then ephraim savage and then amos all with their weapon ready and with every sense upon the alert by midday they be more than half way and halt in thicket for scanty meal of bread and cheese for de lhut would not permit they to light fire "they have not come as far as this he whisper and yet be sure that they have cross the river ah governor de la barre do not know what he do when he stir these man up and this good dragoon whom the king have send we now know even less ""i have see they in peace remark amos have trade to onondaga and to the country of the senecas know they as fine hunter and brave man ""they be fine hunter but the game that they hunt well be their fellow man have myself lead their scalp party and have fight against they and tell you that when general come out from france who hardly know enough to get the sun behind he in fight he will find that there be little credit to be gain from they they talk of burn their village it would be as wise to kick over the wasp nest and think that you have do with the wasp you be from new england monsieur?""my comrade be from new england be from new york ""ah yes could see from your step and your eye that the wood be as home to you the new england man go on the water and he slay the cod with more pleasure than the caribou perhaps that be why his face be so sad have be on the great water and remember that my face be sad also there be little wind and so think that we may light our pipe without danger with good breeze have know burn pipe fetch up scalp party from two mile distance but the tree stop scent and the iroquois nose be less keen than the sioux and the dacotah god help you monsieur if you should ever have an indian war it be bad for we but it would be thousand time bad for you ""and why?""because we have fight the indians from the first and we have they always in our mind when we build you see how along this river every house and every hamlet support its neighbour but you by saint anne of beaupre it make my scalp tingle when come on your frontier and see the lonely farm house and little clearing out in the wood with no help for twenty league around an indian war be purgatory for canada but it would be hell for the english provinces!""we be good friend with the indians say amos we do not wish to conquer ""your people have way of conquering although they say that they do not wish to do it remark du lhut now with we we bang our drum and wave our flag and make stir but no very big thing have come of it yet we have never have but two great man in canada one be monsieur de la salle who be shoot last year by his own man down the great river and the other old frontenac will have to come back again if new france be not to be turn into desert by the five nations it would surprise i little if by this time two year the white and gold flag fly only over the rock of quebec but see that you look at i impatiently monsieur de catinat and know that you count the hour until we be back at sainte marie again forward then and may the second part of our journey be as peaceful as the first "for an hour or more they pick their way through the wood follow in the step of the old french pioneer it be lovely day with hardly cloud in the heavens and the sun stream down through the thick foliage cover the shaded sward with delicate network of gold sometimes where the wood open they come out into the pure sunlight but only to pass into thick glade beyond where single ray here and there be all that could break its way through the vast leafy covering it would have be beautiful these sudden transition from light to shade but with the feeling of impending danger and of horror ever lurk in these shadow the mind be tinge with awe rather than admiration silently lightly the four man pick their step among the great tree trunk suddenly du lhut drop upon his knee and stoop his ear to the ground he rise shake his head and walk on with grave face cast quick little glance into the shadow in every direction "did you hear something whisper amos du lhut put his finger to his lip and then in an instant be down again upon his face with his ear fix to the ground he spring up with the look of man who have hear what he expect to hear "walk on say he quietly and behave exactly as you have do all day ""what be it then?""indian ""in front of us?""no behind we ""what be they doing?""they be follow we ""how many of them?""two think "the friend glance back involuntarily over their shoulder into the dense blackness of the forest at one point single broad shaft of light slide down between two pine and cast golden blotch upon their track save for this one vivid spot all be sombre and silent "do not look round whisper du lhut sharply walk on as before ""are they enemies?""they be iroquois ""and pursue us?""no we be now pursue they ""shall we turn then?""no they would vanish like shadows,""how far off be they?""about two hundred pace think ""they can not see we then?""i think not but can not be sure they be follow our trail think ""what shall we do then?""let we make circle and get behind they "turne sharp to the left he lead they in long curve through the wood hurry swiftly and yet silently under the darkest shadow of the tree then he turn again and presently halt "this be our own track say he "ay and two redskins have pass over it cry amos bend down and point to mark which be entirely invisible to ephraim savage or de catinat "a full grown warrior and lad on his first warpath say du lhut they be move fast you see for you can hardly see the heel mark of their moccasin they walk one behind the other now let we follow they as they follow we and see if we have well luck "he speed swiftly along the trail with his musket cock in his hand the other follow hard upon his heel but there be no sound and no sign of life from the shadowy wood in front of they suddenly du lhut stop and ground his weapon "they be still behind we he say "still behind us?""yes this be the point where we branch off they have hesitate moment as you can see by their footmark and then they have follow on ""if we go round again and quicken our pace we may overtake they ""no they be on their guard now they must know that it could only be on their account that we go back on our track lie here behind the fall log and we shall see if we can catch glimpse of they "a great rotten trunk all green with mould and blotch with pink and purple fungus lie to one side of where they stand behind this the frenchman crouch and his three companion follow his example peer through the brushwood screen in front of they still the one broad sheet of sunshine pour down between the two pine but all else be as dim and as silent as vast cathedral with pillar of wood and roof of leaf not branch that creak nor twig that snap nor any sound at all save the sharp barking of fox somewhere in the heart of the forest thrill of excitement run through the nerve of de catinat it be like one of those game of hide and seek which the court use to play when louis be in sportive mood among the oak and yew hedge of versailles but the forfeit there be carved fan or box of bonbon and here it be death ten minute pass and there be no sign of any live thing behind they "they be over in yonder thicket whisper du lhut nod his head towards dense clump of brushwood two hundred pace away "have you see them?""no ""how do you know then?""i see squirrel come from his hole in the great white beech tree yonder he scuttle back again as if something have scare he from his hole he can see down into that brushwood ""do you think that they know that we be here?""they can not see we but they be suspicious they fear trap ""shall we rush for the brushwood?""they would pick two of we off and be go like shadow through the wood no we have well go on our way ""but they will follow we ""i hardly think that they will we be four and they be only two and they know now that we be on our guard and that we can pick up trail as quickly as they can themselves get behind these trunk where they can not see we so now stoop until you be past the belt of alder bush we must push on fast now for where there be two iroquois there be likely to be two hundred not very far off ""thank god that do not bring adele cry de catinat "yes monsieur it be well for man to make comrade of his wife but not on the border of the iroquois country nor of any other indian country either ""you do not take your own wife with you when you travel then ask the soldier "yes but do not let her travel from village to village she remain in the wigwam ""then you leave she behind?""on the contrary she be always there to welcome i by saint anne should be heavy hearted if come to any village between this and the bluffs of the illinois and do not find my wife wait to greet i ""then she must travel before you "du lhut laugh heartily without however emit sound "a fresh village fresh wife say he but never have more than one in each for it be shame for frenchman to set an evil example when the good father be spend their life so freely in preach virtue to they ah here be the ajidaumo creek where the indians set the sturgeon net it be still seven mile to poitou ""we shall be there before nightfall then?""i think that we have good wait for nightfall before we make our way in since the iroquois scout be out as far as this it be likely that they lie thick round poitou and we may find the last step the bad unless we have care the more so if these two get in front of we to warn the other he pause moment with slant head and sidelong ear by saint anne he mutter we have not shake they off they be still upon our trail!""you hear them?""yes they be no great way from we they will find that they have follow we once too often this time now will show you little bit of woodcraft which may be new to you slip off your moccasin monsieur "de catinat pull off his shoe as direct and du lhut do the same "put they on as if they be glove say the pioneer and an instant later ephraim savage and amos have their comrade shoe upon their hand "you can sle your musket over your back so now down on all four bend yourselves double with your hand press hard upon the earth that be excellent two man can leave the trail of four now come with i monsieur "he flit from tree to tree on line which be parallel to but few yard distant from that of their comrade then suddenly he crouch behind bush and pull de catinat down beside he "they must pass we in few minute he whisper do not fire if you can help it something gleam in du lhut 's hand and his comrade glance down see that he have draw keen little tomahawk from his belt again the mad wild thrill run through the soldier 's blood as he peer through the tangled branch and wait for whatever might come out of the dim silent aisle of tree bole and suddenly he see something move it flit like shadow from one trunk to the other so swiftly that de catinat could not have tell whether it be beast or human and then again he see it and yet again sometimes one shadow sometimes two shadow silent furtive like theloup garouwith which his nurse have scare he in his childhood then for few moment all be still once more and then in an instant there creep out from among the bush the most terrible look creature that ever walk the earth an iroquois chief upon the war trail he be tall powerful man and his bristle of scalp lock and eagle feather make he look giant in the dim light for good eight foot lie between his bead moccasin and the topmost plume of his headgear one side of his face be paint in soot ochre and vermilion to resemble dog and the other half as fowl so that the front view be indescribably grotesque and strange belt of wampum be brace round his loin cloth and dozen scalp lock flutter out as he move from the fringe of his legging his head be sink forward his eye gleam with sinister light and his nostril dilate and contract like those of an excited animal his gun be throw forward and he creep along with bended knee peer listening pausing hurry on breathing image of caution two pace behind he walk lad of fourteen clothe and armed in the same fashion but without the paint face and without the horrid dry trophy upon the legging it be his first campaign and already his eye shine and his nostril twitch with the same lust for murder which burn within his elder so they advance silent terrible creep out of the shadow of the wood as their race have come out of the shadow of history with body of iron and tiger soul they be just abreast of the bush when something catch the eye of the young warrior some displace twig or flutter leaf and he pause with suspicion in every feature another instant and he have warn his companion but du lhut spring out and bury his little hatchet in the skull of the old warrior de catinat hear dull crash as when an axe splinter its way into rotten tree and the man fall like log laugh horribly and kick and strike with his powerful limb the young warrior spring like deer over his fall comrade and dash on into the wood but an instant later there be gunshot among the tree in front follow by faint wail cry "that be his death whoop say du lhut composedly it be pity to fire and yet it be well than let he go "as he speak the two other come back ephraim ram fresh charge into his musket "who be laugh ask amos "it be he say du lhut nod towards the die warrior who lie with his head in horrible puddle and his grotesque feature contort into fix smile it be custom they have when they get their death blow 've know seneca chief laugh for six hour on end at the torture stake ah he be gone!"as he speak the indian give last spasm with his hand and foot and lie rigid grin up at the slit of blue sky above he "he be great chief say du lhut he be brown moose of the mohawks and the other be his second son we have draw first blood but do not think that it will be the last for the iroquois do not allow their war chief to die unavenged he be mighty fighter as you may see by look at his neck "he wear peculiar necklace which seem to de catinat to consist of blacken bean pod set upon string as he stoop over it he see to his horror that they be not bean pod but wither human finger "they be all right fore finger say du lhut so everyone represent life there be forty two in all eighteen be of man whom he have slay in battle and the other twenty four have be take and torture ""how do you know that?""because only eighteen have their nail on if the prisoner of an iroquois be alive he begin always by bite his nail off you see that they be miss from four and twenty "de catinat shudder what demon be these amongst whom an evil fate have drift he and be it possible that his adele should fall into the hand of such fiend no no surely the good god for whose sake they have suffer so much would not permit such an infamy and yet as evil fate have come upon other woman as tender as adele upon other man as love as he what hamlet be there in canada which have not such story in their record vague horror seize he as he stand there we know more of the future than we be willing to admit away down in those dim recess of the soul where there be no reason but only instinct and impression now some impending terror cast its cloud over he the tree around with their great protrude limb be like shadowy demon thrust out their gaunt arm to seize he the sweat burst from his forehead and he lean heavily upon his musket "by saint eulalie say du lhut for an old soldier you turn very pale monsieur at little bloodshed ""i be not well should be glad of sup from your cognac bottle ""here it be comrade and welcome well may as well have this fine scalp that we may have something to show for our walk he hold the indian 's head between his knee and in an instant with sweep of his knife have tear off the hideous dripping trophy "let we go cry de catinat turn away in disgust "yes we shall go but shall also have this wampum belt mark with the totem of the bear so and the gun too look at the london print upon the lock ah monsieur green monsieur green it be not hard to see where the enemy of france get their arm "so at last they turn away du lhut bear his spoil leave the red grinning figure stretch under the silent tree as they pass on they catch glimpse of the lad lying double up among the bush where he have fall the pioneer walk very swiftly until he come to little stream which prattle down to the big river here he slip off his boot and legging and wade down it with his companion for half mile or so "they will follow our track when they find he say he but this will throw they off for it be only on run water that an iroquois can find no trace and now we shall lie in this clump until nightfall for we be little over mile from port poitou and it be dangerous to go forward for the ground become more open "and so they remained conceal among the alder whilst the shadow turn from short to long and the white drift cloud above they be tinge with the pink of the set sun du lhut coil himself into ball with his pipe between his tooth and drop into light sleep prick up his ear and start at the slight sound from the wood around they the two americans whisper together for long time ephraim tell some long story about the cruise of the brigindustry bind to jamestown for sugar and molasse but at last the soothe hum of gentle breeze through the branch lull they off also and they sleep de catinat alone remain awake his nerve still in tingle from that strange sudden shadow which have fall upon his soul what could it mean not surely that adele be in danger he have hear of such warning but have he not leave she in safety behind cannon and stockade by the next evening at late he would see she again as he lie look up through the tangle of copper leave at the sky beyond his mind drift like the cloud above he and he be back once more in the jutting window in the rue st. martin sit on the broadbancal with its spanish leather covering with the gild wool bale creak outside and his arm round shrink timid adele she who have compare herself to little mouse in an old house and who yet have courage to stay by his side through all this wild journey and then again he be back at versailles once more he see the brown eye of the king the fair bold face of de montespan the serene feature of de maintenon once more he ride on his midnight mission be drive by the demon coachman and spring with amos upon the scaffold to rescue the most beautiful woman in france so clear it be and so vivid that it be with start that he come suddenly to himself and find that the night be creep on in an american forest and that du lhut have rouse himself and be ready for start "have you be awake ask the pioneer "yes ""have you hear anything?""nothing but the hooting of the owl ""it seem to i that in my sleep hear gunshot in the distance ""in your sleep?""yes hear as well asleep as awake and remember what hear but now you must follow i close and we shall be in the fort soon ""you have wonderful ear indeed say de catinat as they pick their way through the tangled wood how could you hear that these man be follow we to day could make out no sound when they be within hand touch of we ""i do not hear they at first ""you see them?""no nor that either ""then how could you know that they be there?""i hear frightened jay flutter among the tree after we be past it then ten minute later hear the same thing know then that there be some one on our trail and listen peste!you be woodsman indeed!""i believe that these wood be swarm with iroquois although we have have the good fortune to miss they so great chief as brown moose would not start on the path with small following nor for small object they must mean mischief upon the richelieu you be not sorry now that you do not bring madame?""i thank god for it!""the wood will not be safe fear until the partridge berry be out once more you must stay at sainte marie until then unless the seigneur can spare man to guard you
