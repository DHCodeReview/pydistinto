""i have rather stay there forever than expose my wife to such devil ""ay devil they be if ever devil walk upon earth you wince monsieur when take brown moose 's scalp but when you have see as much of the indians as have do your heart will be as harden as mine and now we be on the very border of the clearing and the blockhouse lie yonder among the clump of maple they do not keep very good watch for have be expect during these last ten minute to hear thequi vive you do not come as near to sainte marie unchallenge and yet de lannes be as old soldier as la noue we can scarce see now but yonder near the river be where he exercise his man ""he do so now say amos see dozen of they draw up in line at their drill ""no sentinel and all the man at drill cry du lhut in contempt it be as you say however for can see they myself with their rank open and each as stiff and straight as pine stump one would think to see they stand so still that there be not an indian nearer than orange we shall go across to they and by saint anne shall tell their commander what think of his arrangement "du lhut advance from the bush as he speak and the four man cross the open ground in the direction of the line of man who wait silently for they in the dim twilight they be within fifty pace and yet none of they have raise hand or voice to challenge their approach there be something uncanny in the silence and change come over du lhut 's face as he peer in front of he he crane his head round and look up the river "my god he scream look at the fort they have clear the clump of tree and the outline of the blockhouse should have show up in front of they there be no sign of it it be gone!so unexpected be the blow that even de lhut harden from his childhood to every shock and danger stood shake and dismayed then with an oath he run at the top of his speed towards the line of figure his companion follow at his heel as they draw near they could see through the dusk that it be not indeed line silent and motionless officer stand out some twenty pace in front of his silent and motionless man far they could see that he wear very high and singular head dress they be still rush forward breathless with apprehension when to their horror this head dress begin to lengthen and broaden and great bird flap heavily up and drop down again on the near tree trunk then they know that their bad fear be true and that it be the garrison of poitou which stand before they they be lash to low post with willow withy some twenty of they naked all and twist and screw into every strange shape which an agonised body could assume in front where the buzzard have perch be the gray head commandant with two cinder thrust into his socket and his flesh hang from he like beggar 's rag behind be the line of man each with his leg char off to the knee and his body so haggle and scorch and burst that the willow band alone seem to hold it together for moment the four comrade stare in silent horror at the dreadful group then each act as his nature bid he de catinat stagger up against tree trunk and lean his head upon his arm deadly sick du lhut fall down upon his knee and say something to heaven with his two clenched hand shake up at the darkening sky ephraim savage examine the priming of his gun with tighten lip and gleam eye while amos green without word begin to cast round in circle in search of trail but du lhut be on his foot again in moment and run up and down like sleuth hound note hundred thing which even amos would have overlook he circle round the body again and again then he run little way towards the edge of the wood and then come back to the charred ruin of the blockhouse from some of which thin reek of smoke be still rise "there be no sign of the woman and child say he "my god there be woman and children?""they be keep the child to burn at their leisure in their village the woman they may torture or may adopt as the humour take they but what do the old man want?""i want you to ask he amos say the seaman why we be yaw and tack here when we should be crack on all sail to stand after them?"du lhut smile and shake his head your friend be brave man say he if he think that with four man we can follow hundred and fifty ""tell he amos that the lord will bear we up say the other excitedly say that he will be with we against the child of jeroboam and we will cut they off utterly and they shall be destroy what be the french for slay and spare not have as soon go about with my jaw brace up as with folk who can not understand plain language "but du lhut wave aside the seaman 's suggestion we must have care now say he or we shall lose our own scalp and be the cause of those at sainte marie lose theirs as well ""sainte marie cry de catinat be there then danger at saintemarie?""ay they be in the wolf 's mouth now this business be do last night the place be storm by war party of hundred and fifty man this morning they leave and go north upon foot they have beencachedamong the wood all day between poitou and sainte marie ""then we have come through them?""yes we have come through they they would keep their camp to day and send out scout brown moose and his son be among they and strike our trail to night to night they will attack sainte marie?""it be possible and yet with so small party should scarce have think that they would have dare well we can but hasten back as quickly as we can and give they warning of what be hang over they "and so they turn for their weary backward journey though their mind be too full to spare thought upon the league which lie behind they or those which be before old ephraim less accustomed to walk than his young comrade be already limp and footsore but for all his age he be as tough as hickory and full of endurance du lhut take the lead again and they turn their face once more towards the north the moon be shine brightly in the sky but it be little aid to the traveller in the depth of the forest where it have be shadowy in the daytime it be now so absolutely dark that de catinat could not see the tree trunk against which he brush here and there they come upon an open glade bathed in the moonshine or perhaps thin shaft of silver light break through between the branch and cast great white patch upon the ground but du lhut prefer to avoid these more open space and to skirt the glade rather than to cross they the breeze have freshen little and the whole air be fill with the rustle and sough of the leave save for this dull never cease sound all would have be silent have not the owl hoot sometimes from among the tree top and the night jar whir above their head dark as it be du lhut walk as swiftly as during the sunlight and never hesitate about the track his comrade could see however that he be take they different way to that which they have go in the morning for twice they catch sight of the glimmer of the broad river upon their left while before they have only see the stream which flow into it on the second occasion he point to where on the farther side they could see dark shadow flit over the water "iroquois canoe he whisper there be ten of they with eight man in each they be another party and they be also go north ""how do you know that they be another party?""because we have cross the trail of the first within the hour "de catinat be fill with amazement at this marvellous man who could hear in his sleep and could detect trail when the very tree trunk be invisible to ordinary eye du lhut halt little to watch the canoe and then turn his back to the river and plunge into the wood once more they have go mile or two when suddenly he come to dead stop snuff at the air like hound on scent "i smell burn wood say he there be fire within mile of we in that direction ""i smell it too say amos let we creep up that way and see their camp ""be careful then whisper du lhut for your life may hang from crack twig "they advance very slowly and cautiously until suddenly the red flare of leap fire twinkle between the distant trunk still slip through the brushwood they work round until they have find point from which they could see without risk of be see great blaze of dry log crackle and spurtle in the centre of small clearing the ruddy flame roar upwards and the smoke spread out above it until it look like strange tree with gray foliage and trunk of fire but no live being be in sight and the huge fire roar and sway in absolute solitude in the midst of the silent woodland nearer they creep and near but there be no movement save the rush of the flame and no sound but the snapping of the stick "shall we go up to it whisper de catinat the wary old pioneer shake his head it may be trap say he "or an abandon camp?""no it have not be light more than an hour ""besides it be far too great for camp fire say amos "what do you make of it ask du lhut "a signal ""yes daresay that you be right this light be not safe neighbour so we shall edge away from it and then make straight line for sainte marie "the flame be soon but twinkling point behind they and at last vanish behind the tree du lhut push on rapidly until they come to the edge of moonlit clearing he be about to skirt this as he have do other when suddenly he catch de catinat by the shoulder and push he down behind clump of sumach while amos do the same with ephraim savage man be walk down the other side of the open space he have just emerge and be cross it diagonally make in the direction of the river his body be bent double but as he come out from the shadow of the tree they could see that he be an indian brave in full war paint with legging loin cloth and musket close at his heel come second and then third and fourth on and on until it seem as if the wood be full of man and that the line would never come to an end they flit past like shadow in the moonlight in absolute silence all crouch and run in the same swift stealthy fashion last of all come man in the fringed tunic of hunter with cap and feather upon his head he pass across like the other and they vanish into the shadow as silently as they have appear it be five minute before du lhut think it safe to rise from their shelter "by saint anne he whisper do you count them?""three hundred and ninety six say amos "i make it four hundred and two ""and you think that there be only hundred and fifty of they cry de catinat "ah you do not understand this be fresh band the other who take the blockhouse must be over there for their trail lie between we and the river ""they could not be the same say amos for there be not fresh scalp among they "du lhut give the young hunter glance of approval on my word saidhe do not know that your woodsman be as good as they seem to be you have eye monsieur and it may please you some day to remember thatgreysolon du lhut tell you so "amos feel flush of pride at these word from man whose name be honour wherever trader or trapper smoke round camp fire he be about to make some answer when dreadful cry break suddenly out of the wood horrible screech as from some one who be goad to the very last pitch of human misery again and again as they stand with blanched cheek in the darkness they hear that awful cry swell up from the night and ring drearily through the forest "they be torture the woman say du lhut "their camp lie over there ""can we do nothing to aid they cry amos "ay ay lad say the captain in english we ca n't pass distress signal without go out of our course let we put about and run down yonder ""in that camp say du lhut slowly there be now nearly six hundred warrior we be four what you say have no sense unless we warn they at sainte marie these devil will lay some trap for they their party be assemble by land and by water and there may be thousand before daybreak our duty be to push on and give our warning ""he speak the truth say amos to ephraim nay but you must not go alone he seize the stout old seaman by the arm and hold he by main force to prevent he from break off through the wood "there be one thing which we can do to spoil their night 's amusement say du lhut the wood be as dry as powder and there have be no drop of rain for long three month ""yes?""and the wind blow straight for their camp with the river on the other side of it ""we should fire the woods!""we can not do well "in an instant du lhut have scrape together little bundle of dry twig and have heap they up against withered beech tree which be as dry as tinder stroke of flint and steel be enough to start little smoulder of flame which lengthen and spread until it be leap along the white strip of hang bark quarter of mile far on du lhut do the same again and once more beyond that until at three different point the forest be in blaze as they hurry onwards they could hear the dull roaring of the flame behind they and at last as they near sainte marie they could see look back the long rolling wave of fire travel ever westward towards the richelieu and flash up into great spout of flame as it lick up clump of pine as if it be bundle of faggot du lhut chuckle in his silent way as he look back at the long orange glare in the sky "they will need to swim for it some of they say he they have not canoe to take they all off ah if have but two hundred of mycoureur de boison the river at the farther side of they not one would have get away ""they have one who be dress like white man remark amos "ay and the most deadly of the lot his father be dutch trader his mother an iroquois and he go by the name of the flemish bastard ah know he well and tell you that if they want king in hell they will find one all ready in his wigwam by saint anne have score to settle with he and may pay it before this business be over well there be the light of sainte marie shine down below there can understand that sigh of relief monsieur for on my word after what we find at poitou be uneasy myself until should see they "day be just break as the four comrade enter the gate of the stockade but early as it be thecensitairesand their family be all afoot stare at the prodigious fire which rage to the south of they de catinat burst through the throng and rush upstairs to adele who have herself fly down to meet he so that they meet in each other 's arm half way up the great stone staircase with burst of those little inarticulate cry which be the true unwritten language of love together with his arm round she they ascend to the great hall where old de la noue with his son be peer out of the window at the wonderful spectacle "ah monsieur say the old nobleman with his courtly bow be indeed rejoice to see you safe under my roof again not only for your own sake but for that of madame 's eye which if she will permit an old man to say so be much too pretty to spoil by strain they all day in the hope of see some one come out of the forest you have do forty mile monsieur de catinat and be doubtless hungry and weary when you be yourself again must claim my revenge in piquet for the card lie against i the other night "but du lhut have enter at de catinat 's heel with his tiding of disaster "you will have another game to play monsieur de sainte marie say he there be six hundred iroquois in the wood and they be prepare to attack ""tut tut we can not allow our arrangement to be alter by handful of savage say the seigneur must apologise to you my dear de catinat that you should be annoy by such people while you be upon my estate as regard the piquet can not but think that your play from king and knave be more brilliant than safe now when play piquet last with de lannes of poitou de lannes of poitou be dead and all his people say du lhut "the blockhouse be heap of smoke ashe "the seigneur raise his eyebrow and take pinch of snuff tap the lid of his little round gold box "i always tell he that his fort would be take unless he clear away those maple tree which grow up to the very wall they be all dead you say?""every man ""and the fort burned?""not stick be leave stand ""have you see these rascals?""we see the trail of hundred and fifty then there be hundred in canoe and war party of four hundred pass we under the flemish bastard their camp be five mile down the river and there can not be less than six hundred ""you be fortunate in escape they ""but they be not so fortunate in escape we we kill brown moose and his son and we fire the wood so as to drive they out of their camp ""excellent excellent say the seigneur clap gently with his dainty hand you have do very well indeed du lhut you be presume very tired?""i be not often tired be quite ready to do the journey again ""then perhaps you would pick few man and go back into the wood to see what these villain be doing?""i shall be ready in five minute ""perhaps you would like to go also achille his son 's dark eye andindian face light up with fierce joy "yes shall go also he answer "very good and we shall make all ready in your absence madame you will excuse these little annoyance which mar the pleasure of your visit next time that you do i the honour to come here trust that we shall have clear all these vermin from my estate we have our advantage the richelieu be well fish pond and these forest be fine deer preserve than any of which the king can boast but on the other hand we have as you see our little trouble you will excuse i now as there be one or two thing which demand my attention de catinat you be tried soldier and should be glad of your advice onega give i my lace handkerchief and my cane of clouded amber and take care of madame until her husband and return "it be bright daylight now and the square enclosure within the stockade be fill with an anxious crowd who have just learn the evil tiding most of thecensitaireswere old soldier and trapper who have serve in many indian war and whose swarthy face and bold bearing tell their own story they be son of race which with well fortune or with bad have burn more powder than any other nation upon earth and as they stand in little group discuss the situation and examine their arm leader could have ask for no more hardy or more war like follow the woman however pale and breathless be hurry in from the outlying cottage drag their child with they and bear over their shoulder the more precious of their household good the confusion the hurry the cry of the child the throwing down of bundle and the rushing back for more contrast sharply with the quiet and the beauty of the wood which encircle they all bathe in the bright morning sunlight it be strange to look upon the fairy loveliness of their many tint foliage and to know that the spirit of murder and cruelty be roam unchained behind that lovely screen the scout party under du lhut and achille de la noue have already leave and at the order of the seigneur the two gate be now secure with huge bar of oak fit into iron staple on either side the child be place in the low store room with few woman to watch they while the other be tell off to attend to the fire bucket and to reload the musket the man have be parade fifty two of they in all and they be divide into party now for the defence of each part of the stockade on one side it have be build up to within few yard of the river which not only relieve they from the defence of that face but enable they to get fresh water by throw bucket at the end of rope from the stockade the boat and canoe of sainte marie be draw up on the bank just under the wall and be precious now as offer last mean of escape should all else fail the next fort st. louis be but few league up the river and de la noue have already send swift messenger to they with news of the danger at least it would be point on which they might retreat should the bad come to the bad and that the bad might come to the bad be very evident to so experienced woodsman as amos green he have leave ephraim savage snore in deep sleep upon the floor and be now walk round the defence with his pipe in his mouth examine with critical eye every detail in connection with they the stockade be very strong nine foot high and closely build of oak stake which be thick enough to turn bullet half way up it be loop hole in long narrow slit for the fire of the defender but on the other hand the tree grow up to within hundred yard of it and form screen for the attack while the garrison be so scanty that it could not spare more than twenty man at the utmost for each face amos know how daring and dashing be the iroquois warrior how cunning and fertile of resource and his face darken as he think of the young wife who have come so far in their safe keeping and of the woman and child whom he have see crowd into the fort "would it not be well if you could send they up the river he suggest to the seigneur "i should very gladly do so monsieur and perhaps if we be all alive we may manage it to night if the weather should be cloudy but can not spare the man to guard they and can not send they without guard when we know that iroquois canoe be on the river and their scout be swarm on the bank ""you be right it would be madness ""i have station you on this eastern face with your friend and with fifteen man monsieur de catinat will you command the party?""willingly ""i will take the south face as it seem to be the point of danger du lhut can take the north and five man should be enough to watch the river side ""have we food and powder?""i have flour and smoke eel enough to see this matter
