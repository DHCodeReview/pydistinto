return with large linen bag in his hand this he fill with powder and then sling it over his shoulder he carry it out to the clump of bush and place it at the base of the sapling cut strip out of the bark immediately above the spot then with few leafy branch and fall leave he cover the powder bag very carefully over so that it look like little hillock of earth having arrange all to his satisfaction he return clamber over the stockade and drop down upon the other side "i think that we be all ready for they now say the seigneur would that the woman and child be in safe place but we may send they down the river to night if all go well have anyone hear anything of du lhut?""jean have the good ear of any of we your excellency say one man from beside the brass corner cannon he think

the time "they ascend to the upper hall where adele come and sit by her husband while the swarthy onega crouch by the window look keenly out into the forest de catinat have little thought to spare upon the card as his mind wander to the danger which threaten they and to the woman whose hand rest upon his own the old nobleman on the other hand be engross by the play and curse under his breath or chuckle and grin as the luck sway one way or the other suddenly as they play there come two sharp rap from without "some one be tap cry adele "it be death that be tap say the indian woman at the window "ay ay it be the patter of two spend ball against the woodwork the wind be against our hear the report the card be shuffle it be my cut and your deal the capot think be mine ""men be rush from the wood cry onega "tut it grow serious say the nobleman we can finish the game later remember that the deal lie with you let we see what it all mean "de catinat have already rush to the window du lhut young achille de la noue and eight of the covering party be run with their head bent towards the stockade the door of which have be open to admit they here and there from behind the tree come little blue puff of smoke and one of the fugitive who wear white calico breech begin suddenly to hop instead of running and red splotch show upon the white cloth two other throw their arm round he and the three rush in abreast while the gate swing into its place behind they an instant later the brass cannon at the corner give flash and roar while the whole outline of the wood be trace in rolling cloud and the shower of bullet rap up against the wooden wall like sleet on window having leave adele to the care of her indian hostess and warn she for her life to keep from the window de catinat seize his musket and rush downstairs as he pass bullet come pipe through one of the narrow embrasure and star itself in little blotch of lead upon the opposite wall the seigneur have already descend and be converse with du lhut beside the door "a thousand of they you say?""yes we come on fresh trail of large war party three hundred at the least they be all mohawks and cayugas with sprinkling of oneidas we have running fight for few mile and we have lose five man ""all dead trust ""i hope so but we be hard press to keep from be cut off jean mance be shoot through the leg ""i see that he be

canoe from pass so we might send our woman away to night ""i have intend to do so will you take charge of the north side you might come across to i with ten of your man now and shall go back to you if they change their attack "the firing come in one continuous rattle now from the edge of the wood and the air be full of bullet the assailant be all train shot man who live by their gun and to whom shake hand or dim eye mean poverty and hunger every slit and crack and loop hole be mark and cap hold above the stockade be blow in an instant from the gun barrel which support it on the other hand the defender be also skilled in indian fighting and wise in every trick and lure which could protect themselves or tempt their enemy to show they keep well to the side of the loop hole watch through little crevice of the wood and fire swiftly when chance offer red leg stick straight up into the air from behind log show where one bullet at least have go home but there be little to aim at save puff and flash from among the leave or the shadowy figure of warrior see for an instant as he dart from one tree trunk to the other seven of the canadians have already be hit but only three be mortally wound and the other four still keep manfully to their loop hole though one who have be strike through the jaw be spit his tooth with his bullet down into his gun barrel the woman sit in line upon the ground beneath the level of the loop hole each with saucerful of bullet and canister of powder pass up the loaded gun to the fighting man at the point where quick fire be most needful at first the attack have be all upon the south face but as fresh body of the iroquois come up their line spread and lengthen until the whole east face be girt with fire which gradually envelop the north also the fort be ring in by great loop of smoke save only where the broad river flow past they over near the further bank the canoe be lurk and one man by ten warrior attempt to pass up the stream but good shot from the brass gun dash in her side and sink she while second of grape leave only four of the swimmer whose high scalp lock stand out above the water like the back fin of some strange fish on the inland side however the seigneur have order the cannon to be serve no more for the broad embrasure draw the enemy 's fire and of the man who have be strike half be among those who work the gun the old nobleman strut about with his white ruffle and his clouded cane behind the line of parch smoke grime man tap his snuff box shoot out his little jest and look very much less concerned than he have do over his piquet "what do you think of it du lhut he ask "i think very badly of it we be lose man much too fast ""well my friend what can you expect when thousand musket be all turn upon little place like this some one must suffer for it ah my poor fellow so you be do for too!"the man nearest he have suddenly fall with crash lie quite still with his face in platter of the sagamite which have be bring out by the woman du lhut glance at he and then look round "he be in line with no loop hole and it take he in the shoulder say he where do it come from then ah by saint anne look there he point upwards to little mist of smoke which hang round the summit of high oak "the rascal overlook the stockade but the trunk be hardly thick enough to shield he at that height this poor fellow will not need his musket again and see that it be ready prime de la noue lay down his cane turn back his ruffle pick up the dead man 's gun and fire at the lurk warrior two leave flutter out from the tree and grin vermilion face appear for an instant with yell of derision quick as flash du lhut bring his musket to his shoulder and pull the trigger the man give tremendous spring and crash down through the thick foliage some seventy or eighty foot below he single stout branch shoot out and on to this he fall with the sound of great stone drop into bog and hang there double over it swinge slowly from side to side like red rag his scalp lock streaming down between his foot shout of exultation rise from the canadians at the sight which be drown in the murderous yell of the savage "his limb twitch he be not dead cry de la noue "let he die there say the old pioneer callously ram fresh charge into his gun ah there be the gray hat again it come ever when be unload ""i see plume hat among the brushwood ""it be the flemish bastard have rather have his scalp than those of his hundred good warrior ""is he so brave then?""yes he be brave enough there be no deny it for how else could he be an iroquois war chief but he be clever and cunning and cruel ah my god if all the story tell be true his cruelty be past believe should fear that my tongue would wither if do but name the thing which this man have do ah he be there again "the gray hat with the plume have show itself once more in rift of the smoke de la noue and du lhut both fire together and the cap flutter up into the air at the same instant the bush part and tall warrior spring out into full view of the defender his face be that of an indian but shade or two light and pointed black beard hang down over his hunting tunic he throw out his hand with gesture of disdain stand for an instant look steadfastly at the fort and then spring back into cover amid shower of bullet which chip away the twig all round he "yes he be brave enough du lhut repeat with an oath yourcensitaireshave have their hoe in their hand more often than their musket should judge from their shooting but they seem to be draw close upon the east face and think that they will make rush there before long "the fire have indeed grow very much fiercer upon the side which be defend by de catinat and it be plain that the main force of the iroquois be gather at that point from every log and trunk and cleft and bush come the red flash with the gray halo and the bullet sing in continuous stream through the loop hole amos have whittle little hole for himself about foot above the ground and lie upon his face load and fire in his own quiet methodical fashion beside he stand ephraim savage his mouth set grimly his eye flash from under his down draw brow and his whole soul absorb in the smiting of the amalekites his hat be go his grizzle hair fly in the breeze great splotch of powder mottle his mahogany face and weal across his right cheek show where an indian bullet have graze he de catinat be bear himself like an experienced soldier walk up and down among his man with short word of praise or of precept those fire word rough and blunt which bring glow to the heart and flush to the cheek seven of his man be down but as the attack grow fiercer upon his side it slacken upon the other and the seigneur with his son and du lhut bring ten man to reinforce they de la noue be hold out his snuff box to de catinat when shrill scream from behind they make they both look round onega the indian wife be wring her hand over the body of her son glance show that the bullet have pierce his heart and that he be dead for an instant the old nobleman 's thin face grow shade paler and the hand which hold out the little gold box shake like branch in the wind then he thrust it into his pocket again and master the spasm which have convulse his feature "the de la noues always die upon the field of honour he remark "i think that we should have some more man in the angle by the gun "and now it become clear why it be that the iroquois have choose the eastern face for their main attack it be there that the clump of cover lie midway between the edge of the forest and the stockade storm party could creep as far as that and gather there for the final rush first one crouch warrior and then second and then third darted across the little belt of open space and throw themselves down among the bush the fourth be hit and lie with his back break few pace out from the edge of the wood but stream of warrior continue to venture the passage until thirty six have get across and the little patch of underwood be full of lurking savage amos green 's time have come from where he lie he could see the white patch where he have cut the bark from the birch saple and he know that immediately underneath it lie the powder bag he sight the mark and then slowly lower his barrel until he have get to the base of the little tree as nearly as he could guess it among the tangle of bush the first shot produce no result however and the second be aim foot low the bullet penetrate the bag and there be an explosion which shake the manor house and sway the whole line of stout stockade as though they be corn stalk in breeze up to the high summit of the tree go the huge column of blue smoke and after the first roar there be deathly silence which be break by the patter and thud of fall body then come wild cheer from the defender and furious answering whoop from the indians while the fire from the wood burst out with great fury than ever but the blow have be heavy one of the thirty six warrior all pick for their valour only four regain the shelter of the wood and those so torn and shatter that they be spend man already the indians have lose heavily and this fresh disaster make they reconsider their plan of attack for the iroquois be as wary as they be brave and he be esteem the good war chief who be most chary of the life of his follower their fire gradually slacken and at last save for dropping shot here and there it die away altogether "is it possible that they be go to abandon the attack cry decatinat joyously amos believe that you have save we "but the wily du lhut shake his head wolf would as soon leave half gnaw bone as an iroquois such prize as this ""but they have lose heavily ""ay but not so heavily as ourselves in proportion to our number they have fifty out of thousand and we twenty out of threescore no no they be hold council and we shall soon hear from they again but it may be some hour first and if you will take my advice you will have an hour 's sleep for you be not as can see by your eye as use to do without it as be and there may be little rest for any of we this night "de catinat be indeed weary to the last pitch of human endurance amos green and the seaman have already wrap themselves in their blanket and sink to sleep under the shelter of the stockade the soldier rush upstairs to say few word of comfort to the tremble adele and then throw himself down upon couch he sleep the dreamless sleep of an exhausted man when at last he be rouse by fresh sputter of musketry fire from the wood the sun be already low in the heavens and the mellow light of evening tinge the bare wall of the room he spring from his couch seize his musket and rush downstairs the defender be gather at their loop hole once more while du lhut the seigneur and amos green be whisper eagerly together he notice as he pass that onega still sit croon by the body of her son without having change her position since morning "what be it then be they come on he ask "they be up to some devilry say du lhut peer out at the corner of the embrasure they be gather thickly at the east fringe and yet the firing come from the south it be not the indian way to attack across the open and yet if they think help be come from the fort they might venture it ""the wood in front of we be alive with they say amos they be as busy as beaver among the underwood ""perhaps they be go to attack from this side and cover the attack by fire from the flank ""that be what think cry the seigneur bring the spare gun up here and all the man except five for each side "the word be hardly out of his mouth when shrill yell burst from the wood and in an instant cloud of warrior dash out and charge across the open howling springing and wave their gun or tomahawks in the air with their paint face smear and stripe with every vivid colour their stream scalp lock their wave arm their open mouth and their writhing and contortion no more fiendish crew ever burst into sleeper 's nightmare some of those in front bore canoe between they and as they reach the stockade they plant they against it and swarm up they as if they have be scale ladder other fire through the embrasure and loop hole the muzzle of their musket touch those of the defender while other again spring unaided on to the top of the palisade and jump fearlessly down upon the inner side the canadians however make such resistance as might be expect from man who know that no mercy await they they fire whilst they have time to load and then club their musket they smash furiously at every red head which show above the rail the din within the stockade be infernal the shout and cry of the french the whooping of the savage and the terrified scream of the frightened woman blend into one dreadful uproar above which could be hear the high shrill voice of the old seigneur implore hiscensitairesto stand fast with his rapier in his hand his hat lose his wig awry and his dignity all throw to the wind the old nobleman show they that day how soldier of rocroy could carry himself and with du lhut amos de catinat and ephraim savage be ever in the forefront of the defence so desperately do they fight the sword and musket butt outreache the tomahawk that though at one time fifty iroquois be over the palisade they have slay or drive back nearly all of they when fresh wave burst suddenly over the south face which have be strip of its defender du lhut see in an instant that the enclosure be lose and that only one thing could save the house "hold they for an instant he scream and rush at the brass gun he strike his flint and steel and fire it straight into the thick of the savage then as they recoil for an instant he stick nail into the touch hole and drive it home with blow from the butt of his gun dart across the yard he spike the gun at the other corner and be back at the door as the remnant of the garrison be hurl towards it by the rush of the assailant the canadians dart in and swing the ponderous mass of wood into position break the leg of the foremost warrior who have strive to follow they then for an instant they have time for breathing and for council but their case be very evil one have the gun be lose so that they might be turn upon the door all further resistance would have be vain but du lhut 's presence of mind have save they from that danger the two gun upon the river face and the canoe be safe for they be command by the window of the house but their number be terribly reduce and those who be leave be weary and wound and spend nineteen have gain the house but one have be shoot through the body and lie groan in the hall while second have his shoulder cleft by tomahawk and could no long raise his musket du lhut de la noue and de catinat be uninjured but ephraim savage have bullet hole in his forearm and amos be bleed from cut upon the face of the other hardly one be without injury and yet they have no time to think of their hurt for the danger still press and they be lose unless they act few shot from the barricaded window suffice to clear the enclosure for it be all expose to their aim but on the other hand they have the shelter of the stockade now and from the further side of it they keep up fierce fire upon the window half dozen of thecensitairesreturne the fusillade while the leader consult as to what have well be do "we have twenty five woman and fourteen child say the seigneur be sure that you will agree with i gentleman that our first duty be towards they some of you like myself have lose son or brother this day let we at least save our wife and sister ""no iroquois canoe have pass up the river say one of the canadians if the woman start in the darkness they can get away to the fort ""by saint anne of beaupre exclaim du lhut think it would be well if you could get your man out of this also for can not see how it be to be hold until morning "a murmur of assent break from the other canadians but the old nobleman shake his bewigge head with decision "tut tut what nonsense be this he cry be we to abandon the manor house of sainte marie to the first gang of savage who choose to make an attack upon it no no gentleman there be still nearly score of we and when the garrison learn that we be so pressed which will be by to morrow morning at the late they will certainly send we relief "du lhut shake his head moodily "if you stand by the fort will not desert you say he and yet it be pity to sacrifice brave man for nothing ""the canoe will hardly hold the woman and child as it be cry theuriet there be but two large and four small there be not space for single man ""then that decide it say de catinat but who be to row the women?""it be but few league with the current in their favour and there be none of our woman who do not know how to handle paddle "the iroquois be very quiet now and an occasional dropping shoot from the tree or the stockade be the only sign of their presence their loss have be heavy and they be either engage in collect their dead or in hold council as to their next move
