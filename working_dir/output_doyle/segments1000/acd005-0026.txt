but admire the energy and tenacity of the man "it seem to i father that you would have shine more as soldier than as follower of christ say he but since you have follow we here and since there be no get away we may settle this question at some later time "but the two americans be less inclined to take so peaceful view ephraim savage 's beard bristle with anger and he whisper something into amos green 's ear "the captain and could easily get rid of he say the young woodsman draw de catinat aside if hewillcross our path he must pay for it ""no no not for the world amos let he alone he do what he think to be his duty though his faith be strong than his charity think but here come the rain and surely it be dark enough now for the boat "a great brown cloud have overspread the heavens and the night have fall so rapidly that they could hardly see the gleam of the river in front of they the savage in the wood and behind the capture stockade be quiet save for an occasional shot but the yell and whoop from the cottage of thecensitairesshowe that they be be plunder by their captor suddenly dull red glow begin to show above one of the roof "they have set it on fire cry du lhut the canoe must go at once for the river will soon be as light as day in in there be not an instant to lose!"there be no time for leave taking one impassioned kiss and adele be tear away and thrust into the small canoe which she share with onega two child and an unmarried girl the other rush into their place and in few moment they have push off and have vanish into the drift and the darkness the great cloud have break and the rain patter heavily upon the roof and splash upon their face as they strain their eye after the vanish boat "thank god for this storm murmur du lhut it will prevent the cottage from blaze up too quickly "but he have forget that though the roof might be wet the interior be as dry as tinder he have hardly speak before great yellow tongue of flame lick out of one of the window and again and again until suddenly half of the roof fall in and the cottage be blaze like pitch bucket the flame hiss and sputter in the pour rain but feed from below they grow still high and fiercer flash redly upon the great tree and turn their trunk to burnished brass their light make the enclosure and the manor house as clear as day and expose the whole long stretch of the river fearful yell from the wood announce that the savage have see the canoe which be plainly visible from the window not more than quarter of mile away "they be rush through the wood they be make for the water 's edge cry de catinat "they have some canoe down there say du lhut "but they must pass we cry the seigneur of sainte marie get down to the cannon and see if you can not stop they "they have hardly reach the gun when two large canoe fill with warrior shoot out from among the reed below the fort and steer out into mid stream begin to paddle furiously after the fugitive "jean you be our good shot cry de la noue lay for she as she pass the great pine tree lambert do you take the other gun the life of all whom you love may hang upon the shot!"the two wrinkle old artilleryman glance along their gun and wait for the canoe to come abreast of they the fire still blaze higher and high and the broad river lie like sheet of dull metal with two dark line which mark the canoe sweep swiftly down the centre one be fifty yard in front of the other but in each the indians be bend to their paddle and pull frantically while their comrade from the wooded shore whoop they on to fresh exertion the fugitive have already disappear round the bend of the river as the first canoe come abreast of the low of the two gun the canadian make the sign of the cross over the touch hole and fire cheer and then groan go up from the eager watcher the discharge have strike the surface close to the mark and dash such shower of water over it that for an instant it look as if it have be sink the next moment however the splash subside and the canoe shoot away uninjured save that one of the rower have drop his paddle while his head fall forward upon the back of the man in front of he the second gunner sight the same canoe as it come abreast of he but at the very instant when he stretch out his match to fire bullet came hum from the stockade and he fall forward dead without groan "this be work that know something of lad say old ephraim spring suddenly forward but when fire gun like to train it myself give i help with the handspike and get she straight for the island so little low for an even keel now we have they he clap down his match and fire it be beautiful shot the whole charge take the canoe about six foot behind the bow and double she up like an eggshell before the smoke have clear she have founder and the second canoe have pause to pick up some of the wound man the other as much at home in the water as in the wood be already strike out for the shore "quick quick cry the seigneur load the gun we may get the second one yet!"but it be not to be long before they could get it ready the iroquois have pick up their wound warrior and be pull madly up stream once more as they shoot away the fire die suddenly down in the burn cottage and the rain and the darkness close in upon they "my god cry de catinat furiously they will be take let we abandon this place take boat and follow they come come not an instant be to be lost!""monsieur you go too far in your very natural anxiety say the seigneur coldly be not inclined to leave my post so easily!""ah what be it only wood and stone which can be build again but to think of the woman in the hand of these devil oh be go mad come come for christ 's sake come his face be deadly pale and he rave with his clenched hand in the air "i do not think that they will be catch say du lhut lay his hand soothingly upon his shoulder do not fear they have long start and the woman here can paddle as well as the man again the iroquois canoe be overload at the start and have the wound man aboard as well now besides these oak canoe of the mohawks be not as swift as the algonquin birch bark which we use in any case it be impossible to follow for we have no boat ""there be one lie there ""ah it will but hold single man it be that in which the friar come ""then be go in that my place be with adele he fling open the door rush out and be about to push off the frail skiff when some one spring past he and with blow from hatchet stove in the side of the boat "it be my boat say the friar throw down the axe and fold his arm can do what like with it ""you fiend you have ruin us!""i have find you and you shall not escape i again "the hot blood flush to the soldier 's head and pick up the axe he take quick step forward the light from the open door shine upon the grave harsh face of the friar but not muscle twitch nor feature change as he see the axe whirl up in the hand of furious man he only sign himself with the cross and mutter latin prayer under his breath it be that composure which save his life de catinat hurl down the axe again with bitter curse and be turn away from the shattered boat when in an instant without warning the great door of the manor house crash inwards and flood of whooping savage burst into the house what have occur be easily explain the watcher in the window at the front find that it be more than flesh and blood could endure to remain wait at their post while the fate of their wife and child be be decide at the back all be quiet at the stockade and the indians appear to be as absorb as the canadians in what be pass upon the river one by one therefore the man on guard have creep away and have assemble at the back to cheer the seaman 's shot and to groan as the remain canoe speed like bloodhound down the river in the wake of the fugitive but the savage have one at their head who be as full of wile and resource as du lhut himself the flemish bastard have watch the house from behind the stockade as dog watch rat hole and he have instantly discover that the defender have leave their post with score of other warrior he raise great log from the edge of the forest and cross the open space unchallenged he and his man rush it against the door with such violence as to crack the bar across and tear the wood from the hinge the first intimation which the survivor have of the attack be the crash of the door and the scream of two of the negligent watchman who have be seize and scalp in the hall the whole basement floor be in the hand of the indians and de catinat and his enemy the friar be cut off from the foot of the stair fortunately however the manor house of canada be build with the one idea of defence against indians and even now there be hope for the defender wooden ladder which could be draw up in case of need hang down from the upper window to the ground upon the river side de catinat rush round to this follow by the friar he feel about for the ladder in the darkness it be go then indeed his heart sink in despair where could he fly to the boat be destroy the stockade lie between he and the forest and they be in the hand of the iroquois their yell be ring in his ear they have not see he yet but in few minute they must come upon he suddenly he hear voice from somewhere in the darkness above he "give i your gun lad it say see the loom of some of the heathen down by the wall ""it be i. it be amos cry de catinat down with the ladder or be dead man ""have care it may be ruse say the voice of du lhut "no no 'll answer for it cry amos and an instant later down come the ladder de catinat and the friar rush up it and they hardly have their foot upon the rung when swarm of warrior burst out from the door and pour along the river bank two musket flash from above something plop like salmon in the water and next instant the two be among their comrade and the ladder have be draw up once more but it be very small band who now hold the last point to which they could retreat only nine of they remain the seigneur du lhut the two americans the friar de catinat theuriet the major domo and two of thecensitaire wound parch and powder blacken they be still fill with the mad courage of desperate man who know that death could come in no more terrible form than through surrender the stone staircase run straight up from the kitchen to the main hall and the door which have be barricade across the low part by two mattress command the whole flight hoarse whispering and the click of the cocking of gun from below tell that the iroquois be muster for rush "put the lantern by the door say du lhut so that it may throw the light upon the stair there be only room for three to fire but you can all load and pass the gun monsieur green will you kneel with i and you jean duval if one of we be hit let another take his place at once now be ready for they be coming!"a he speak there be shrill whistle from below and in an instant the stair be fill with rush red figure and wave weapon bang bang bang go the three gun and then again and again bang bang bang the smoke be so thick in the low roof room that they could hardly see to pass the musket to the eager hand which grasp for they but no iroquois have reach the barricade and there be no patter of their foot now upon the stair nothing but an angry snarling and an occasional groan from below the marksman be uninjured but they cease to fire and wait for the smoke to clear and when it clear they see how deadly their aim have be at those close quarter only nine shot have be fire and seven indians be litter up and down on the straight stone stair five of they lie motionless but two try to crawl slowly back to their friend du lhut and thecensitaireraise their musket and the two crippled man lie still "by saint anne say the old pioneer as he ram home another bullet if they have our scalp we have sell they at great price hundred squaw will be howl in their village when they hear of this day 's work ""ay they will not forget their welcome at sainte marie say the old nobleman must again express my deep regret my dear de catinat that you and your wife should have be put to such inconvenience when you have be good enough to visit i trust that she and the other be safe at the fort by this time ""may god grant that they be oh shall never have an easy moment until see she once more ""if they be safe we may expect help in the morning if we can hold out so long chambly the commandant be not man to leave comrade at pinch "the card be still lay out at one end of the table with the trick overlap each other as they have leave they on the previous morning but there be something else there of more interest to they for the breakfast have not be clear away and they have be fight all day with hardly bite or sup even when face to face with death nature still cry out for her due and the hungry man turn savagely upon the loaf the ham and the cold wild duck little cluster of wine bottle stand upon the buffet and these have their neck knock off and be empty down parched throat three man still take their turn however to hold the barricade for they be not to be catch nap again the yell and screech of the savage come up to they as though all the wolf of the forest be coope up in the basement but the stair be desert save for the seven motionless figure "they will not try to rush we again say du lhut with confidence "we have teach they too severe lesson ""they will set fire to the house ""it will puzzle they to do that say the major domo it be solid stone wall and stair save only for few beam of wood very different from those other cottage ""hush cry amos green and raise his hand the yell have die away and they hear the heavy thud of mallet beat upon wood "what can it be?""some fresh devilry no doubt ""i regret to say monsieur observe the seigneur with no abatement of his courtly manner that it be my belief that they have learn lesson from our young friend here and that they be knock out the head of the powder barrel in the store room "but du lhut shake his head at the suggestion it be not in redskin to waste powder say he it be deal too precious for they to do that ah listen to that!"the yelling and screeching have begin again but there be wilder madder ring in their shrillness and they be mingle with snatch of song and burst of laughter "ha it be the brandy cask which they have open cry du lhut "they be bad before but they will be fiend out of hell now "as he speak there come another burst of whoop and high above they voice call for mercy with horror in their eye the survivor glance from one to the other heavy smell of burn flesh rise from below and still that dreadful voice shriek and plead then slowly it quaver away and be silent forever "who be it whisper de catinat his blood run cold in his vein "it be jean corbeil think ""may god rest his soul his trouble be over would that we be as peaceful as he ah shoot he shoot!"a man have suddenly spring out at the foot of the stair and have swing his arm as though throw something it be the flemish bastard amos green 's musket flash but the savage have spring back again as rapidly as he appear something splash down amongst they and roll across the floor in the lamp light "down down it be bomb cry de catinatbut it lie at du lhut 's foot and he have see it clearly he take cloth from the table and drop it over it "it be not bomb say he quietly and itwasjean corbeil who die "for four hour sound of riot of dancing and of revel rise up from the store house and the smell of the open brandy cask fill
