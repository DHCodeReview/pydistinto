the whole air more than once the savage quarrel and fight among themselves and it seem as if they have forget their enemy above but the besiege soon find that if they attempt to presume upon this they be as closely watch as ever the major domo theuriet pass between loop hole and light be kill instantly by bullet from the stockade and both amos and the old seigneur have narrow escape until they block all the window save that which overlook the river there be no danger from this one and as day be already break once more one or other of the party be forever strain their eye down the stream in search of the expected succour slowly the light creep up the eastern sky little line of pearl then band of pink broaden stretch spread until it shoot its warm colour across the heaven tinge the edge of the drift cloud over the woodland lie thin gray vapour the top of the high oak jut out like dim island from the sea of haze gradually as the light increase the mist shred off into little ragged wisp which thin and drift away until at last as the sun push its glowing edge over the eastern forest it gleam upon the red and orange and purple of the fade leave and upon the broad blue river which curl away to the northward de catinat as he stand at the window look out be breathe in the healthy resinous scent of the tree mingle with the damp heavy odour of the wet earth when suddenly his eye fall upon dark spot upon the river to the north of they there be canoe come down he cry in an instant they have all rush to the opening but du lhut spring after they and pull they angrily towards the door "do you wish to die before your time he cry "ay ay say captain ephraim who understand the gesture if not the word we must leave watch on deck amos lad lie here with i and be ready if they show "the two americans and the old pioneer hold the barricade while the eye of all the other be turn upon the approach boat groan break suddenly from the only survivingcensitaire ."it be an iroquois canoe he cry "impossible!""alas your excellency it be so and it be the same one which pass we last night ""ah then the woman have escape they ""i trust so but alas seigneur fear that there be more in the canoe now than when they pass we "the little group of survivor wait in breathless anxiety while the canoe speed swiftly up the river with line of foam on either side of she and long fork swirl in the water behind they could see that she appear to be very crowded but they remember that the wound of the other boat be aboard she on she shoot and on until as she come abreast of the fort she swing round and the rower raise their paddle and burst into shrill yell of derision the stern of the canoe be turn towards they now and they see that two woman be seat in it even at that distance there be no mistaking the sweet pale face or the dark queenly one beside it the one be onega and the other be adele charles de la noue seigneur de sainte marie be hard and self contain man but groan and bitter curse burst from he when he see his indian wife in the hand of her kinsman from whom she could hope for little mercy yet even now his old fashioned courtesy to his guest have make he turn to de catinat with some word of sympathy when there be clatter of wood something darken the light of the window and the young soldier be go without word he have lower the ladder and be clamber down it with frantic haste then as his foot touch the ground he signal to his comrade to draw it up again and dash into the river he swam towards the canoe without arm and without plan he have but the one think that his place be by the side of his wife in this the hour of her danger fate should bring he what it bring she and he swear to himself as he clove way with his strong arm that whether it be life or death they should still share it together but there be another whose view of duty lead he from safety into the face of danger all night the franciscan have watch de catinat as miser watch his treasure fill with the thought that this heretic be the one little seed which might spread and spread until it choke the choose vineyard of the church now when he see he rush so suddenly down the ladder every fear be banish from his mind save the overpower one that he be about to lose his precious charge he too clamber down at the very heel of his prisoner and rush into the stream not ten pace behind he and so the watcher at the window see the strange of sight there in mid stream lie the canoe with ring of dark warrior cluster in the stern and the two woman crouch in the midst of they swim madly towards they be de catinat rise to the shoulder with the strength of every stroke and behind he again be the tonsure head of the friar with his brown capote and long trail gown float upon the surface of the water behind he but in his zeal he have think too little of his own power he be good swimmer but he be weight and hamper by his unwieldy clothe slow and slow grow his stroke low and lower his head until at last with great shriek ofin manus tuas domine!he throw up his hand and vanish in the swirl of the river minute later the watcher hoarse with scream to he to return see de catinat pull aboard the iroquois canoe which be instantly turn and continue its course up the river "my god cry amos hoarsely they have take he he be lose ""i have see some strange thing in these forty year but never the like of that say du lhut the seigneur take little pinch of snuff from his gold box and flick the wandering grain from his shirt front with his dainty lace handkerchief "monsieur de catinat have act like gentleman of france say he if could swim now as do thirty year ago should be by his side "du lhut glance round he and shake his head we be only six now say he fear they be up to some devilry because they be so very still ""they be leave the house cry thecensitaire who be peep through one of the side window what can it mean holy virgin be it possible that we be save see how they throng through the tree they be make for the canoe now they be wave their arm and pointing ""there be the gray hat of that mongrel devil amongst they say the captain would try shot upon he be it not waste of powder and lead ""i have hit the mark at as long range say amos push his long brown gun through chink in the barricade which they have throw across the low half of the window would give my next year 's trade to bring he down ""it be forty pace far than my musket would carry remark du lhut but have see the english shoot great way with those long gun "amos take steady aim rest his gun upon the window sill and fire shout of delight burst from the little knot of survivor the flemishbastard have fall but he be on his foot again in an instant andshook his hand defiantly at the window "curse it cry amos bitterly in english have hit he with spend ball as well strike he with pebble ""nay curse not amos lad but try he again with another pinch of powder if your gun will stand it "the woodsman thrust in full charge and choose well rounded bullet from his bag but when he look again both the bastard and his warrior have disappear on the river the single iroquois canoe which hold the captive be speed south as swiftly as twenty paddle could drive it but save this one dark streak upon the blue stream not sign be to be see of their enemy they have vanish as if they have be an evil dream there be the bullet spot stockade the litter of dead body inside it the burned and roofless cottage but the silent wood lie gleam in the morning sunshine as quiet and peaceful as if no hell burst of fiend have ever break out from they "by my faith believe that they have go cry the seigneur "take care that it be not ruse say du lhut why should they fly before six man when they have conquer sixty?"but thecensitairehad look out of the other window and in an instant he be down upon his knee with his hand in the air and his powder blacken face turn upwards patter out prayer and thanksgiving his five comrade rush across the room and burst into shriek of joy the upper reach of the river be cover with flotilla of canoe from which the sun strike quick flash as it shine upon the musket barrel and trapping of the crew already they could see the white coat of the regular the brown tunic of the coureur de bois\ and the gaudy colour of the hurons and algonquins on they sweep dot the whole breadth of the river and grow large every instant while far away on the southern bend the iroquois canoe be mere move dot which have shoot away to the farther side and lose itself presently under the shadow of the tree another minute and the survivor be out upon the bank wave their cap in the air while the prow of the first of their rescuer be already grate upon the pebble in the stern of the very foremost canoe sit wizened little man with large brown wig and gild headed rapier lay across his knee he spring out as the keel touch bottom splash through the shallow water with his high leather boot and rush up to the seigneur he fling himself into his arm "my dear charles he cry you have hold your house like hero what only six of you tut tut this have be bloody business!""i know that you would not desert comrade chambly we have save the house but our loss have be terrible my son be dead my wife be in that iroquois canoe in front of you "the commandant of fort st. louis press his friend 's hand in silent sympathy "the other arrive all safe he say at last only that one be take on account of the breaking of paddle three be drown and two capture there be french lady in it understand as well as madame ""yes and they have take her husband as well ""ah poor soul well if you be strong enough to join we you and your friend we shall follow after they without the loss of an instant ten of my man will remain to guard the house and you can have their canoe jump in then and forward for life and death may hang upon our speed!"the iroquois have not treat de catinat harshly when they drag he from the water into their canoe so incomprehensible be it to they why any man should voluntarily leave place of safety in order to put himself in their power that they could only set it down to madness malady which inspire awe and respect among the indians they do not even tie his wrist for why should he attempt to escape when he have come of his own free will two warrior pass their hand over he to be sure that he be unarmed and he be then thrust down between the two woman while the canoe dart in towards the bank to tell the other that the st. louis garrison be come up the stream then it steer out again and make its way swiftly up the centre of the river adele be deadly pale and her hand as her husband lay his upon it be as cold as marble "my darling he whisper tell i that all be well with you that you be unhurt!""oh amory why do you come why do you come amory oh think could have bear anything but if they hurt you could not bear that ""how could stay behind when know that you be in their hands?i should have go mad!""ah it be my one consolation to think that you be safe ""no no we have go through so much together that we can not part now what be death adele why should we be afraid of it?""i be not afraid of it ""and be not afraid of it thing will come about as god will it and what he will must in the end be the good if we live then we have this memory in common if we die then we go hand in hand into another life courage my own all will be well with we ""tell i monsieur say onega be my lord still living?""yes he be alive and well ""it be good he be great chief and have never be sorry not even now that have wed with one who be not of my own people but ah my son who shall give my son back to i he be like the young sapling so straight and so strong who could run with he or leap with he or swim with he ere that sun shine again we shall all be dead and my heart be glad for shall see my boy once more "the iroquois paddle have bent to their work until good ten mile lie between they and sainte marie then they run the canoe into little creek upon their own side of the river and spring out of she drag the prisoner after they the canoe be carry on the shoulder of eight man some distance into the wood where they conceal it between two fall tree heap litter of branch over it to screen it from view then after short council they start through the forest walk in single file with their three prisoner in the middle there be fifteen warrior in all eight in front and seven behind all arm with musket and as swift footed as deer so that escape be out of the question they could but follow on and wait in patience for whatever might befall they all day they pursue their dreary march pick their way through vast morass skirt the border of blue woodland lake where the gray stork flap heavily up from the reed at their approach or plunge into dark belt of woodland where it be always twilight and where the falling of the wild chestnut and the chatter of the squirrel hundred foot above their head be the only sound which break the silence onega have the endurance of the indians themselves but adele in spite of her former journey be footsore and weary before evening it be relief to de catinat therefore when the red glow of great fire beat suddenly through the tree trunk and they come upon an indian camp in which be assemble the great part of the war party which have be drive from sainte marie here too be number of the squaw who have come from the mohawk and cayuga village in order to be near to the warrior wigwam have be erect all round in circle and before each of they be the fire with kettle sling upon tripod of stick in which the evening meal be be cook in the centre of all be very fierce fire which have be make of brushwood place in circle so as to leave clear space of twelve foot in the middle pole stand up in the centre of this clearing and something all mottle with red and black be tie up against it de catinat step swiftly in front of adele that she might not see the dreadful thing but he be too late she shudder and draw quick breath between her pale lip but no sound escape she "they have begin already then say onega composedly well it will be our turn next and we shall show they that we know how to die ""they have not ill use we yet say de catinat perhaps they will keep we for ransom or exchange "the indian woman shake her head do not deceive yourself by any such hope say she when they be as gentle as they have be with you it be ever sign that you be reserve for the torture your wife will be married to one of their chief but you and must die for you be warrior and be too old for squaw "marrie to an iroquois those dreadful word shoot pang through both their heart which no thought of death could have do de catinat 's head drop forward upon his chest and he stagger and would have fall have adele not catch he by the arm "do not fear dear amory she whisper other thing may happen but not that for swear to you that shall not survive you no it may be sin or it may not but if death will not come to i will go to it "de catinat look down at the gentle face which have set now into the hard line of an immutable resolve he know that it would be as she have say and that come what might that last outrage would not befall they could he ever have believe that the time would come when it would send thrill of joy through his heart to know that his wife would die?as they enter the iroquois village the squaw and warrior have rush towards they and they pass through double line of hideous face which jeer and jibe and howl at they as they pass their escort lead they through this rabble and conduct they to hut which stand apart it be empty save for some willow fishing net hang at the side and heap of pumpkin store in the corner "the chief will come and will decide upon what be to be do with we say onega here they be come now and you will soon see that be right for know the way of my own people "an instant later an old war chief accompany by two young brave and by the bearded half dutch iroquois who have lead the attack upon the manor house stroll over and stand in the doorway look in at the prisoner and shoot little guttural sentence at each other the totem of the hawk the wolf the bear and the snake show that they each represent one of the great family of the nation the bastard be smoke stone pipe and yet it be he who talk the most argue apparently with one of the young savage who seem to come round at last to his opinion finally the old chief say few short stern word and the matter appear to be settle "and you you beldame say the bastard in french to the iroquois woman you will have lesson this night which will teach you to side against your own people ""you half breed mongrel reply the fearless old woman you should take that hat from your head when you speak to one in whose vein run the good blood of the onondagas you warrior you who with thousand at your back could not make your way into little house with few poor husbandman within it it be no wonder that your father 's people have cast you out go back and work at the bead or play at the game of plum stone for some day in the wood you might meet with man and so bring disgrace upon the nation which have take you in!"the evil face of the bastard grow livid as he listen to the scornful word which be hiss at he by the captive he stride across to she and take her hand he thrust her forefinger into the burn bowl of his pipe she make no effort to remove it but sit with perfectly set face for minute or more look out through the open door at the evening sunlight and the little group of chatter indians he have watch she keenly in the hope of hear cry or see some spasm of agony upon her face but at last with curse he dash down her hand and stride from the hut she thrust her charred finger into her bosom and laugh "he be good for nought she cry he do not even know how to torture now could have get cry out of he be sure of it but you monsieur you be very white!""it be the sight of such hellish deed ah if we be but set face to face with my sword he with what weapon he choose by god he should pay for it with his heart 's blood "the indian woman seem surprised it be strange to i she say that you should think of what befall i when you be yourself under the same shadow but our fate will be as say ""ah!""you and be to die at the stake she be to be give to the dog who have leave we ""ah!""adele adele what shall do he tear his hair in his helplessness and distraction "no no fear not amory for my heart will not fail i what be the pang of death if it bind we together?""the young chief plead for you say that themitche manitouhad stricken you with madness as could be see by your swimming to their canoe and that blight would fall upon the nation if you be lead to the stake but this bastard say that love come often like madness among the pale face and that it be that alone which have drive you then it be agree that you should die and that she should go to his wigwam since he have lead the war party as for i their heart be bitter against i and also be to die by the pine splinter "de catinat breathe prayer that he might meet his fate like soldier and gentleman "when be it to be he ask "now at once they have go to make all ready but you have time yet for be to go first ""amory amory could we not die together now cry adele throw her arm round her husband if it be sin it be surely sin which will be forgive we let we go dear let we leave these dreadful people and this cruel world and turn where we shall find peace "the indian woman 's eye flash with satisfaction "you have speak well white lily say she why should you wait until it be their pleasure to pluck you see already the glare of their fire beat upon the tree trunk and you can hear the howling of those who thirst for your blood if you die by your own hand they will be rob of their spectacle and their chief will have lose his bride so you will be the victor in the end and they the vanquished you have say rightly white lily there lie the only path for you!""but how to take it?"onega glance keenly at the two warrior who stand as sentinel at the door of the hut they have turn away absorb in the horrible preparation which be go on then she rummage deeply within the fold of her loose gown and pull out small pistol with two brass barrel and double trigger in the form of wing dragon it be only toy to look at all carve and scroll and grave with the choice work of the paris gunsmith for its beauty the seigneur have buy it at his last visit to quebec and yet it might be useful too and it be load in both barrel "i mean to use it on myself say she as she slip it into the hand of de catinat but now be minded to show they that can die as an onondaga should die and that be worthy to have the blood of their chief in my vein take it for swear that will not use it myself unless it be to fire both bullet into that bastard 's heart "a flush of joy shoot over de catinat as his finger close round the pistol here be indeed key to unlock the gate of peace adele lay her cheek against his shoulder and laugh with pleasure "you will forgive i dear he whisper "forgive you
