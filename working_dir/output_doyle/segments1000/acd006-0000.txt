the eye of some member of the firm the member in question be broad shoulder bull necked young man who lean against the marble mantel piece turn over the page of an almanac and take from time to time stealthy peep over the top of it at the toiler around he command be imprint in every line of his strong square set face and erect powerful frame above the medium size with vast spread of shoulder broad aggressive jaw and bright bold glance his whole pose and expression speak of resolution push to the verge of obstinacy there be something classical in the regular olive tint feature and black crisp curl hair fit tightly to the well rounded head yet though classical there be an absence of spirituality it be rather the profile of one of those roman emperor splendid in its animal strength but lack those subtle softness of eye and mouth which speak of an inner life the heavy gold chain across the waistcoat and the bright stone which blaze upon the finger be the natural complement of the sensuous lip and curve chin such be ezra only child of john girdlestone and heir to the whole of his vast business little wonder that those who have an eye to the future bent over their ledger and work with vigour calculate to attract the attention of the junior partner and to impress he with due sense of their enthusiastic regard for the interest of the firm it be speedily apparent however that the young gentleman 's estimate of their service be not entirely base upon their present performance with his eye still fix upon the almanac and sardonic smile upon his dark face he utter single word parker!"a flaxen haired clerk perch at the further end of the high glistening desk give violent start and look up with scared face "well parker who win ask the junior partner "won sir the youth stammer "yes who win repeat his employer "i hardly understand you sir the clerk say grow very red and confused "oh yes you do parker young girdlestone remark tap his almanac sharply with the paper

address the senior clerk seat at the high solitary desk apart from the other yes think so now odd man out be no doubt very harmless and fascinating game but you can hardly expect we to encourage it so far as to pay so much an hour for the privilege of have it play in our counting house shall therefore recommend my father to deduct five shilling from the sum which each of you will receive upon saturday that will cover the time which you have devote to your own amusement during the week "he pause and the three culprit be begin to cool down and congratulate themselves when he begin again "you will see mr. gilray that this deduction be make he say and at the same time beg that you will deduct ten shilling from your own salary since as senior clerk the responsibility of keep order in this room in the absence of your employer rest with you and you appear to have neglect it trust you will look to this mr. gilray ""yes sir the senior clerk answer meekly he be an elderly man with large family and the lose ten shilling would make difference to the sunday dinner there be nothing for it but to bow to the inevitable and his little pinched face assume an expression of gentle resignation how to keep his ten young subordinate in order however be problem which vex he sorely the junior partner be silent and the remain clerk be work uneasily not exactly know whether they might not presently be include in the indictment their fear be terminate however by the sharp sound of table gong and the appearance of boy with the announcement that mr. girdlestone would like moment 's conversation with mr. ezra the latter give keen glance at his subject and withdraw into the back office disappearance which be hail by ten pen be throw into the air and deftly catch again while as many derisive and triumphant young man mock at the imploring effort of old gilray in the interest of law and order the sanctum of mr. john girdlestone be approach by two door one of oak with ground glass panel and the other cover with green baize the room itself be small but lofty and the wall be ornament by numerous section of ship stick upon long flat board very much as the remain of fossil

north of cape palmas an inscription beneath this work of art announce that it have be paint by the second officer and present by he to the head of the firm it be generally rumour that the merchant have lose heavily over this disaster and there be some who quote it as an instance of girdlestone 's habitual strength of mind that he should decorate his wall with so melancholy souvenir this view of the matter do not appear to commend itself to flippant member of lloyd 's agency who contrive to intimate by dexterous use of his left eyelid and right forefinger that the vessel may not have be so much under insure nor the loss to the firm so enormous as be commonly report john girdlestone as he sit at his square office table wait for his son be undeniably remarkable look man for good or for evil no weak character lie beneath that hard angular face with the strongly marked feature and deep set eye he be clean shaven save for an iron grey fringe of ragged whisker under each ear which blend with the grizzle hair above so self contain hard set and immutable be his expression that it be impossible to read anything from it except sternness and resolution quality which be as likely to be associate with the high nature as with the most dangerous it may have be on account of this ambiguity of expression that the world 's estimate of the old merchant be very vary one he be know to be fanatic in religion purist in moral and man of the strict commercial integrity yet there be some few who look askance at he and none save one who could apply the word friend to he he rise and stand with his back to the fire place as his son enter he be so tall that he tower above the young man but the latter 's square and compact frame make he apart from the difference of age the strong man the young man have drop the air of sarcasm which he find be most effective with the clerk and have resume his natural manner which be harsh and brusque "what be up he ask drop back into chair and jingle the loose coin in his trouser pocket "i have have news of theblack eagle his father answer she be report from madeira ""ah cry the junior partner eagerly what luck?""she be full or nearly so accord to captain hamilton miggs report ""i wonder miggs be able to send report at all and wonder still more that you should put any faith in it his son say impatiently the fellow be never sober ""miggs be good

miggs he say ivory be at fancy figure ""we be sorely in need of few good voyage girdlestone remark for thing have be very slack of late there be one very sad piece of intelligence here which take away the satisfaction which we might otherwise feel three of the crew have die of fever he do not mention the name ""the devil say ezra we know very well what that mean three woman each with an armful of brat besiege the office and clamour for pension why be seaman such improvident dogs?"his father hold up his white hand deprecatingly wish he say that you would treat these subject with more reverence what could be sad than that the bread winner of family should be cut off it have grieve i more than can tell ""then you intend to pension the wife ezra say with sly smile "by no mean his father return with decision girdlestone and co. be not an insurance office the labourer be worthy of his hire but when his work in this world be over his family must fall back upon what have be save by his industry and thrift it would be dangerous precedent for we to allow pension to the wife of these sailor for it would deprive the other of all motive for lay their money by and would indirectly encourage vice and dissipation "ezra laugh and continue to rattle his silver and key "it be not upon this matter that desire to speak to you girdlestone continue it have however always be my practice to prefer matter of business to private affair however press john harston be say to be die and he have send message to i say that he wish to see i it be inconvenient for i to leave the office but feel that it be my christian duty to obey such summon wish you therefore to look after thing until return ""i can hardly believe that the news be true ezra say in astonishment there must be some mistake why speak

few day have hear he say that perhaps we should also go together we be in the hand of high power however and it seem that one shall be take and another left ""how will the money go if the doctor be right ezra ask keenly "every penny to the girl she will be an heiress there be no other relation that know of except the dimsdales and they have fair fortune of their own but must go ""by the way malignant typhoid be very catching be it not?""so they say the merchant say quietly and stride off through the counting house ezra girdlestone remain behind stretch his leg in front of the empty grate the governor be hard nail he soliloquize as he stare down at the shine steel bar depend upon it though he feel this more than he show why it be the only friend he ever have in the world or ever will have in all probability however it be no business of mine with which comfort reflection he begin to whistle as he turn over the page of the private day book of the firm it be possible that his son 's surmise be right and that the gaunt unemotional african merchant feel an unwonted heartache as he hail hansom and drive out to his friend 's house at fulham he and harston have be charity schoolboy together have rough it together rise together and prosper together when john girdlestone be raw boned lad and harston chubby face urchin the latter have come to look upon the other as his champion and guide there be some mind which be parasitic in their nature alone they have little vitality but they love to settle upon some strong intellect from which they may borrow their emotion and conclusion at second hand strong vigorous brain collect around it in time many other whose mental process be feeble imitation of its own thus it come to pass that as the year roll on harston learn to lean more and more upon his old school fellow graft many of his stern peculiarity upon his own simple vacuous nature until he become strange parody of the original to he girdlestone be the ideal man girdlestone 's way the correct way and girdlestone 's opinion the weighty of all opinion forty year of this undeviating fidelity must however he might conceal it have make an impression upon the feeling of the elder man harston by incessant attention to business and extreme parsimony have succeed in found an export trading concern in this he have follow the example of his friend there be no fear of their interest ever come into collision as his operation be confine to the mediterranean the firm grow and prosper until harston begin to be look upon as warm man in the city circle his only child be kate girl of seventeen there be no other near relative save dr. dimsdale prosperous west end physician no wonder that ezra girdlestone 's active business mind and perhaps that of his father too should speculate as to the disposal of the fortune of the die man girdlestone push open the iron gate and stride down the gravel walk which lead to his friend 's house bright autumn sun shine out of cloudless heaven bathe the green lawn and the many colour flower bed in its golden light the air the leave the bird all speak of life it be hard to think that death be close its grip upon he who own they all plump little gentleman in black be just descend the step "well doctor the merchant ask how be your patient?""you've not come with the intention of see he have you the doctor ask glance up with some curiosity at the grey face and overhang eyebrow of the merchant "yes be go up to he now ""it be most virulent case of typhoid he may die in an hour or he may live until nightfall but nothing
