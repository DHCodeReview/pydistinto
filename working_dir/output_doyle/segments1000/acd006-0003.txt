off down the lodging house stair rectorial election be peculiarly scotch institution and however it may strike the impartial observer it be regard by the student themselves as rite of extreme solemnity and importance from which grave issue may depend to hear the speech and address of rival orator one would suppose that the integrity of the constitution and the very existence of the empire hang upon the return of their special nominee two candidate be choose from the most eminent of either party and day be fix for the polling every undergraduate have vote but the professor have no voice in the matter as the duty be nominal and the position honourable there be never any lack of distinguished aspirant for vacancy occasionally some well know literary or scientific man be invite to become candidate but as rule the election be fight upon strictly political line with all the old fashioned accompaniment of parliamentary contest for month before the great day there be bustle and stir secret committee meet rule be formulate and insidious agent prowl about with an eye to the political training of those who have not yet nail their colour to any particular mast then come grand meeting of the liberal students association which be trump by dinner of the undergraduates conservative society the campaign be then in full swing great board appear at the university gate on which pithy satire against one or other candidate parody on song quotation from their speech and gaudily paint cartoon be post those who be suppose to be able to feel the pulse of the university move about with the weight of much knowledge upon their brow throw out hint as to the probable majority one way or the other some profess to know it to nicety other shake their head and remark vaguely that there be not much to choose either way so week after week go by until the excitement reach climax when the date of the election come round there be no need upon that day for dr. dimsdale or any other stranger in the town to ask his way to the university for the whooping and yelling which proceed from that usually decorous building might have be hear from prince 's street to newington in front of the gate be dense crowd of townspeople peer through into the quadrangle and derive much entertainment from the movement of the lively young gentleman within large number of the more peaceable undergraduate stand about under the arch and these quickly make way for the newcomer for both garraway and dimsdale as note athlete command respect among their fellow student which medallist and honour man might look for in vain the broad open quadrangle and all the numerous balcony and terrace which surround it be crowd with an excited mob of student the whole three thousand odd elector who stand upon the college roll appear to be present and the noise which they be make would have reflect credit on treble their number the dense crowd surge and seethe without pause or rest now and again some orator would be hoist up on the shoulder of his fellow when an oscillation of the crowd would remove his supporter and down he would come only to be succeed by another at some other part of the assembly the name of either candidate would produce roar of applause and equally vigorous howl of execration those who be lucky enough to be in the balcony above hurl down missile on the crowd beneath pea egg potato and bag of flour or of sulphur while those below wherever they find room to swing an arm return the fusillade with interest the doctor 's view of academical serenity and the high converse of pallid student vanish into thin air as he gaze upon the mad tumultuous scene yet in spite of his fifty year he laugh as heartily as any boy at the wild prank of the young politician and the ruin which be work upon broad cloth coat and shoot jacket by the hail of unsavoury projectile the crowd be most dense and most noisy in front of the class room in which the counting of the vote be go forward at one the result be to be announce and as the long hand of the great clock creep towards the hour hush of expectation fall upon the assembly the brazen clang break harshly out and at the same moment the fold door be fling open and knot of man rush out into the crowd who swirl and eddy round they the centre of the throng be violently agitated and the whole mass of people sway outward and inward for minute or two the excited combatant seethe and struggle without clue as to the cause of the commotion then the corner of large placard be elevate above the head of the rioter on which be visible the word liberal in great letter but before it could be raise far it be tear down and the struggle become fiercer than ever up come the placard again the other corner this time with the word majority upon it and then immediately vanish as before enough have be see however to show which way the victory have go and shout of triumph arise everywhere with wave of hat and clatter of stick meanwhile in the centre the two party fight round the placard and the commotion begin to cover wide area as either side be reinforce by fresh supporter one gigantic liberal seize the board and hold it aloft for moment so that it could be see in its entirety by the whole multitude liberal majority,241.but his triumph be short lived stick descend upon his head his heel be trip up and he and his placard roll upon the ground together the victor succeed however in force their way to the extreme end of the quadrangle where as every edinburgh man know the full length statue of sir david brewster look down upon the classic ground which he love so well an audacious radical swarm up upon the pedestal and balance the obnoxious notice on the marble arm of the professor thus convert into political partisan the revere inventor of the kaleidoscope become the centre of furious struggle the vanquished politician make the most desperate effort to destroy the symbol of their opponent victory while the other offer an equally vigorous resistance to their attack the struggle be still proceed when dimsdale remove his father for it be impossible to say what form the riot might assume "what goth what barbarian cry the little doctor as they walk down the bridges and this be my dream of refine quiet and studious repose!""they be not always like that sir say his son apologetically "they be certainly little jolly to day ""a little jolly cry the doctor you rogue tom believe if have not be there you would have be their ringleader "he glance from one to the other and it be so evident from the expression of their face that he have just hit the mark that he burst into great guffaw of laughter in which after moment 's hesitation his two young companion heartily join the rectorial election have come and have go but another great event have take its place it be the day of the england and scotland rugby match well weather could not have be desire the morning have be hazy but as the sun shine out the fog have gradually rise until now there remain but suspicion of it float like plume above the frown wall of edinburgh castle and twine fairy wreath round the unfinished column of the national monument upon the calton hill the broad stretch of the prince 's street gardens which occupy the valley between the old town and the new look green and spring like and their fountain sparkle merrily in the sunshine their wide expanse well trim and bepathed form strange contrast to the rugged pile of grim old house which bound they upon the other side and the massive grandeur of the great hill beyond which lie like crouch lion keep watch and ward day and night over the ancient capital of the scottish king traveller who have search the whole world round have find no fair view so think three of the genus who be ensconce that forenoon in the bow window of theroyal hoteland gaze across the bright green valley at the dull historical background beyond one we already know stoutish gentleman ruddy faced and black eyed with check trouser light waistcoat and heavy chain leg widely part his hand in his pocket and on his face that expression of irreverent and critical approval with which the travel briton usually regard the work of nature by his side be young lady in tight fitting travel dress with trim leather belt and snow white collar and cuff there be no criticism in her sweet face now flush with excitement nothing but unqualified wonder and admiration at the beautiful scene before she an elderly placid face woman sit in basket chair in the recess and look up with quiet love eye at the swift play of emotion which sweep over the girl 's eager feature "oh uncle george she cry it be really too heavenly can not realize that we be free ca n't help fear that it be all dream and that shall wake up to find myself pour out ezra girdlestone 's coffee or listen to mr. girdlestone as he read the morning quotation "the eld woman stroke the girl 's hand caressingly with her soft motherly palm do n't think about it she murmur "no do n't think about it echo the doctor my wife be quite right do n't think about it but dear i what job have to persuade your guardian to let you go should have give it up in despair really should if have not know that you have set your heart upon it ""oh how good you both be to i cry the girl in pretty little gush of gratitude "pooh pooh kate but as to girdlestone he be perfectly right if have you should keep you fast to myself promise you eh matilda?""that we would george ""perfect tyrant both of we eh matilda?""yes george ""i

chasten those whom he love he do not seem to like be chasten bit though but how delightful this be it be like live in another world "the girl be pretty figure as she stand in the window tall lithe and graceful with the long soft curve of bud womanhood her face be sweet rather than beautiful but an artist would have revel in the delicate strength of the softly rounded chin and the quick bright play of her expression her hair of deep rich brown with bronze shimmer where sunbeam lie athwart it sweep back in those thick luxuriant coil which be the unfailing index of strong womanly nature her deep blue eye dance with life and light while her slightlyretroussenose and her sensitive smile mouth all speak of gentle good humour from her sunny face to the dainty little shoe which peep from under the trim black skirt she be an eminently pleasant object to look upon so think the passer by as they glance up at the great bow window and so too think young gentleman who have drive up to the hotel door and who now bound up the step and into the room he be envelop in long shaggy ulster which stretch down to his ankle and he wear velvet cap trim with silver stick carelessly on the back of his powerful yellow curl head "here be the boy cry his mother gaily "how be you mam dear he cry stoop over she to kiss she how be you dad good morning cousin kate you must come down and wish we luck what blessing that it be pretty warm it be miserable for the spectator when there be an east wind what do you think of it dad?""i think you be an unnatural young renegade to play against your mother country say the sturdy doctor "oh come dad be bear in scotland and belong to scotch club surely that be good enough ""i hope you lose then ""we be very likely to atkinson of the west of scotland have strain his leg and we shall have to play blair of the institution at full back not so good man by long way the odd be five to four on the english this morning they be say to be the very strong lot that ever play in an international match have bring cab with i so the moment you be ready we can start "there be other besides the student who be excited about the come struggle all edinburgh be in ferment football be and always have be the national game of scotland among those who affect violent exercise while golf take its place with the more sedately inclined there be no game so fit to appeal to hardy and active people as that composite exercise prescribe by the rugby union in which fifteen man pit strength speed endurance and every manly attribute they possess in prolong struggle against fifteen antagonist there be no room for mere knack or trickery it be fierce personal contest in which the ball be the central rallying point that ball may be kick push or carry it may be force onwards in any conceivable manner towards the enemy 's goal the fleet of foot may seize it and by superior speed thread their way through the rank of their opponent the heavy of frame may crush down all opposition by dead weight the hardiest and most endure must win even match between prominent local club excite much interest in edinburgh and attract crowd of spectator how much more then when the pick of the manhood of scotland be to try their strength against the very cream of the player from the south of the tweed the road which converge on the raeburn place grounds on which the match be to be play be dark with thousand all wend their way in one direction so thick be the move mass that the carriage of the dimsdale party have to go at walk for the latter half of the journey in spite of the objurgation of the driver who as patriot feel the responsibility which rest upon he in have one of the team in his charge and the necessity there be for deliver he up by the appoint time many in the crowd recognize the young fellow and wave their hand to he or call out few word of encouragement miss kate harston and even the doctor begin to reflect some of the interest and excitement which show itself on every face around they the youth alone seem to be unaffected by the general enthusiasm and spend the time in endeavour to explain the principle of the game to his fair companion whose ignorance of it be comprehensive and astounding "you understand he say that there be fifteen player on each side but it would not do for the whole of these fifteen man to play in crowd for in that case if the other side force the ball past they they would have nothing to fall back upon no reserve as it be therefore as we play the game in scotland ten man be tell off to play in knot they be pick for their weight strength and endurance they be call the forward and be suppose to be always on the ball follow it everywhere never stop or tire they be opposed of course by the forward of the other side now immediately behind the forward be the two quarter back they should be very active fellow good dodger and fast runner they never join in the very rough work but they always follow on the outskirt of the forward and if the ball be force past it be their duty to pick it up and make away with it like lightning if they be very fast they may succeed in carry it long way before they be catch tackled as we call it it be their duty also to keep their eye on the quarter back of the enemy and to tackle they if they get away behind they again be the two half back or three quarter as they call they in england be one of they they be suppose to be fast runner too and good deal of the tackling come to their lot for good runner of the other side can often get past the quarter and then the half have get to bring he down behind the half back be single man the back he be the last resource when all other be past he should be sure and long kicker so as to get the ball away from the goal by that mean but you be not listen ""oh yes be say kate as matter of fact the great throng and the novel sight be distract she so much that she find it hard to attend to her companion 's disquisition "you'll understand it quickly enough when you see it the student remark cheerily here we be at the ground "as he speak the carriage rattle through broad gateway into large open grassy space with great pavilion at one side of it and staked enclosure about two hundred yard long and hundred broad with goal post at each end this space be mark out by gaily coloured flag and on every side of it press against the barrier the whole way round be an enormous crowd twenty and thirty deep with other occupy every piece of rise ground or coign of vantage behind they the most moderate computation would place the number of spectator at fifteen thousand at one side there be line of cab in the background and thither the carriage of the dimsdales drive while tom rush off with his bag to the pavilion to change it be high time to do so for just as the carriage take up its position hoarse roar burst from the great multitude and be take up again and again it be welcome to the english team which have just appear upon the ground there they be clothe in white knickerbocker and jersey with single red rise embroider upon their breast as gallant look set of young fellow as the whole world could produce tall square shoulder straight limbed as active as kitten and as powerful as young bullock it be clear that they would take lot of beating they be the pick of the university and london club with few player from the northern county not man among they whose name be not know wherever football be play that tall long legged youth be evans the great half back who be say to be able to send drop kick far than any of his predecessor in the annal of the game there be buller the famous cambridge quarter only ten stone in weight but as lithe and slippery as an eel and jackson the other quarter be just such another hard to tackle himself but as tenacious as bulldog in hold an adversary that one with the straw coloured hair be coles the great forward and there be nine lad of metal who will stand by he to day through thick and thin they be formidable look lot and bet which have be five on four to they in the morning show symptom of come to five to three in the meantime by no mean abash at find themselves the cynosure of so many eye the englishmen proceed to keep up their
