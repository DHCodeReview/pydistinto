circulation by leap frog and horse play for their jersey be thin and the wind bleak but where be their adversary few impatient moment slowly pass and then from one corner of the ground there rise second cheer which ripple down the long line of onlooker and swell into mighty shout as the scotchmen vault over the barrier into the arena it be nice question for connoisseur in physical beauty as to which team have the good of it in physique the northerners in their blue jersey with thistle upon their breast be sturdy hard bite lot average couple of pound more in weight than their opponent the latter be perhaps more regularly and symmetrically build and be pronounce by expert to be the fast team but there be massive gaunt look about the scotch forwards which promise well for their endurance indeed it be on their forward that they principally rely the presence of three such player as buller evans and jackson make the english exceptionally strong behind but they have no man in front who be individually so strong and fast as miller watts or grey dimsdale and garraway the scotch half back and tookey the quarter whose blazing red head be very oriflamme wherever the struggle wax hot be the good man that the northerners could boast of behind the english have win the choice of goal and elect to play with what slight wind there be at their back small thing may turn the scale between two evenly balanced team evans the captain place the ball in front of he upon the ground with his man line all along on either side as eager as hound in leash some fifty yard in front of he about the place where the ball would drop the blue vest scot gather in sullen crowd there be sharp ring from bell murmur of excitement from the crowd evans take two quick step forward and the yellow ball fly swift and straight as if it have be shoot from cannon right into the expectant group in front of he for moment there be grasp and turmoil among the scotchmen then from the crowd emerge grey the great glasgow forward the ball tuck well under his arm his head down run like the wind with his nine forwards in dense clump behind he ready to bear down all opposition while the other five follow more slowly cover wide stretch of ground he meet the englishmen who have start full cry after the ball the moment that their captain have kick it the first hurl himself upon he grey without slacken his pace swerve slightly and he miss he the second he pass in the same way but the third catch quickly at his leg and the scot fly head over heel and be promptly collar not much use collar he now in the very act of fall he have throw the ball behind he gordon of paisley catch it and bear it on dozen yard when he be seize and knock down but not before he have bequeath his trust to another who struggle manfully for some pace before he too be bring to the ground this pretty piece of pass have recover for the scotch all the advantage lose by the english kick off and be greet by roar of applause from the crowd and now there be maul or scrimmage be there ever another race which do such thing and call it play twenty young man so blended and inextricably mixed that no one could assign the various arm and leg to their respective owner be strain every muscle and fibre of their body against each other and yet be so well balanced that the dense clump of humanity stand absolutely motionless in the centre be an inextricable chaos where shoulder heave and head rise and fall at the edge be fringe of leg leg in an extreme state of tension ever paw for firm foothold and apparently completely independent of the rest of their owner whose head and body have bore their way into themelee the pressure in there be tremendous yet neither side give an inch just on the skirt of the throng with bent body and hand on knee stand the cool little quarter back watch the gasp giant and also keep keen eye upon each other let the ball emerge near one of these and he will whip it up and be ten pace off before those in the maul even know that it be go behind they again be the half alert and watchful while the back with his hand in his pocket have an easy consciousness that he will have plenty of warning before the ball can pass the four good man who stand between the maul and himself now the dense throng sway little backwards and forwards an inch be lose and an inch be gain the crowd roar with delight maul scotland maul england england scotland the shouting would stir the blood of the mild mortal that ever breathe kate harston stand in the carriage rosy with excitement and enjoyment her heart be all with the wearer of the rose in spite of the presence of her old play mate in the opposite rank the doctor be as much delighted as the young man on the ground and the cabman wave his arm and shout in highly indecorous fashion the two pound difference in weight be begin to tell the english sway back yard or two blue coat emerge among the white one he have fight his way through but have leave the ball behind he so he dash round and put his weight behind it once more there be last upheaval the maul be split in two and through the rent come the redoubtable scotch forwards with the ball amongst they their solid phalanx have scatter the english like spray to right and leave there be no one in front of they no one but single little man almost boy in size and weight surely he can not hope to stop the tremendous rush the ball be few yard in advance of the lead scot when he spring forward at it he seize it an instant before his adversary and with the same motion writhe himself free from the man 's grasp now be the time for the crack cambridge quarter back to show what he be make of the crowd yell with excitement to right and leave run the great scotch forwards grasp slip pursue and right in the midst of they as quick and as erratic as trout in pool run the calm face little man dodge one avoid another slip between the finger of two other surely he be catch now no he have pass all the forward and emerge from the ruck of man pelt along at tremendous pace he have dodge one of the scotch quarter and outstrip the other well play england shout the crowd well run buller now tookey now dimsdale well collared dimsdale well collared indeed the little quarter back have come to an end of his career for tom have be as quick as he and have catch he round the waist as he attempt to pass and bring he to the ground the cheer be hearty for the two half back be the only university man in the team and there be hundred of student among the spectator the good doctor colour up with pleasure to hear his boy 's name bellow forth approvingly by thousand excited lung the play be as all good judge say it would be very equal for the first forty minute every advantage gain by either side have be promptly neutralize by desperate effort on the part of the other the mass of struggle player have sway backwards and forwards but never more than twenty or thirty yard from the centre of the ground neither goal have be seriously threaten as yet the spectator fail to see how the odd lay on england be justified but the fancy abide by their choice in the second forty it be think that the superior speed and stay power of the southerners will tell over the heavy scot there seem little the matter with the latter as yet as they stand in group wipe their grimy face and discuss the state of the game for at the end of forty minute the goal be change and there be slight interval and now the last hour be to prove whether there be good man breed in the hungry north as any who live on more fruitful ground and beneath warm sky if the play be desperate before it become even more so now each member of either team play as if upon he alone depend the issue of the match again and again grey anderson gordon and their redoubtable phalanx of dishevel hard breathe scot break away with the ball but as often the english quarter and half back by their superior speed more than make up for the weakness of their forward and carry the struggle back into the enemy 's ground two or three time evans the long kicker who be credit with the power of reach the goal from almost any part of the ground get hold of the ball but each time before he could kick he be charge by some one of his adversary at last however his chance come the ball trickle out of maul into the hand of buller who at once turn and throw it to the half back behind he there be no time to reach he he take quick glance at the distant goal short run forward and his long limb swing through the air with tremendous force there be dead silence of suspense among the crowd as the ball describe lofty parabola down it come down down as straight and true as an arrow just graze the cross bar and pitch on the grass beyond and the groan of few afflicted patriot be drown in the hearty cheer which hail the english goal but the victory be not win yet there be ten minute leave for the scotchmen to recover this blow or for the englishmen to improve upon it the northerners play so furiously that the ball be keep down near the english goal which be only save by the splendid defensive play of their back five minute pass and the scots in turn be be press back series of brilliant run by buller jackson and evans take the fight into the enemy 's country and keep it there it seem as if the visitor mean score again when sudden change occur in the state of affair it be but three minute off the calling of time when tookey one of the scotch quarter back get hold of the ball and make magnificent run pass right through the oppose forward and quarter he be collar by evans but immediately throw the ball behind he dimsdale have follow up the quarter back and catch the ball when it be throw backwards now or never the lad feel that he would sacrifice anything to pass the three man who stand between he and the english goal he pass evans like the wind before the half back could disentangle himself from tookey there be but two now to oppose he the first be the other english half back broad shoulder powerful fellow who rush at he but tom without attempt to avoid he lower his head and drive at he full tilt with such violence that both man reel back from the collision dimsdale recover himself first however and get past before the other have time to seize he the goal be now not more than twenty yard off with only one between tom and it though half dozen more be in close pursuit the english back catch he round the waist while another from behind seize the collar of his jersey and the three come heavily to the ground together but the deed be do in the very act of fall he have manage to kick the ball which flicker feebly up into the air and just clear the english bar it have scarcely touch the ground upon the other side when the ringing of the great bell announce the termination of the match though its sound be entirely drown by the tumultuous shouting of the crowd thousand hat be throw into the air ten thousand voice join in the roar and meanwhile the cause of all this outcry be still sit on the ground smile it be true but very pale and with one of his arm dangle uselessly from his shoulder well the breaking of collar bone be small price to pay for the saving of such match as that so think tom dimsdale as he make for the pavilion with his father keep off the exultant crowd upon one side and jack garraway upon the other the doctor butt path through the dense half crazy mob with vigour which show that his son 's talent in that direction be hereditary within half an hour tom be safely ensconce in the corner of the carriage with his shoulder brace back secundum artem and his arm support by sling how quietly and deftly the two woman slip shawl here and rug there to save he from the jarring of the carriage it be part of the angel nature of woman that when youth and strength be maim and helpless they appeal to she more than they can ever do in the pride and flush of their power here lie the compensation of the unfortunate kate 's dark blue eye fill with ineffable compassion as she bend over he and he catch sight of that expression feel sudden new unaccountable spring of joy bubble up in his heart which make all previous hope and pleasure seem vapid and meaningless the little god shoot hard and straight when his mark be still in the golden dawn of life all the way back he lie with his head among the cushion dream of minister angel his whole soul steep in quiet contentment as it dwell upon the sweet earnest eye which have look so tenderly into his it have be an eventful day with the student he have save his side he have break his collar bone and now most serious of all he have realize that he be hopelessly in love within few week of his recovery from his accident tom dimsdale be to go up for his first professional examination and his father who have now retire from practice with fair fortune remain in edinburgh until that event should come off there have be some difficulty in persuade girdlestone to give his consent to this prolongation of his ward 's leave but the old merchant be very much engross with his own affair about that time which make he more amenable than he might otherwise have be the two traveller continue therefore to reside in their princes street hotel but the student hold on to his lodging in howe street where he use to read during the morning and afternoon every evening however he manage to dine at theroyal and would stay there until his father pack he off to his book once more it be in vain for he to protest and to plead for another half hour the physician be inexorable when the fate hour come round the unhappy youth slowly gather together his hat his glove and his stick spread out that operation over the great possible extent of time which it could by any mean be make to occupy he would then ruefully bid his kinsfolk adieu and retire rebelliously to his book very soon however he make discovery from certain seat in the princes street gardens it be possible to see the interior of the sitting room in which the visitor remain after dinner from the time when this fact dawn upon he his room in the evening know he no more the garden be lock at night but that be mere trifle he use to scramble over the railing like cat and then plant himself upon the particular seat he would keep watch upon the hotel window until the occupant of the room retire to rest it might happen that his cousin remain invisible then he would return to his room in highly dissatisfied state and sit up half the night protest against fate and smoke strong black tobacco on the other hand if he have the good luck to see the graceful figure of his old playfellow he feel that that be the next good thing to be actually in her company and depart eventually in more contented frame of mind thus when dr. dimsdale fondly imagine his son to be mile away grappling with the mystery of science that undutiful lad be in reality perch within sixty yard of he with his thought engross by very different matter kate could not fail to understand what be go on however young and innocent girl may be there be always some subtle feminine instinct which warn she that she be love then first she realize that she have pass the shadowy frontier line which divide the child life from that of the woman kate feel uneasy and perplexed and half involuntarily she change her manner towards he it have be frank and sisterly now it become more distant and constrain he be quick to observe the change and in private raved and rage at it he even make the mistake of show his pique to she upon which she become still more retire and conventional then be bemoan himself in the sleepless watch of the night and confide to his bed post that in his belief such case have never occur before in the history of the world and never by any chance could or would happen again he also break out into an eruption of bad verse which be find by his landlady during her daily examination of his private paper and be read aloud to select audience of neighbour who be all much impressed and cackle sympathetically among themselves by degree tom develop other symptom of the distemper which have come upon he so suddenly he have always be remarkable for certain towsiness of appearance and carelessness of dress which harmonize with his bohemian habit all this he suddenly abjure one fine morning he pay successive visit to his tailor his boot maker his hatter and his hosier which leave all those worthy tradesman rub their hand with satisfaction about week afterwards he emerge from his room in state of gorgeousness which impress his landlady and amazed his friend his old college companion hardly recognize tom 's honest phiz as it look out above the most fashionable of coat and under the glossy of hat his father be anything but edify by the change "i do n't know what be come over the lad kate he remark after one of his visit if think he be go to turn to fop by the lord harry 'd disown he do n't you notice change in he yourself?"kate manage to evade the question but her bright blush might have open the old man 's eye have he observe it he hardly realize yet that his son really be man and still less do he think of john harston 's little girl as woman it be generally some comparative stranger who first make that discovery and bring it home to friend and relative love have an awkward way of intrude itself at inconvenient time but it never come more inopportunely than when it smite one who be read for his first professional examination during these week when tom be stump about in boot which be two size too small for he in the hope of make his muscular well form foot trifle more elegant and be split glove in way which surprise his glover all his energy ought by right to have be concentrate upon the mystery of botany chemistry and zoology during the precious hour that should have be devote to the mastering of the sub division of the celenterata or the natural order of endogenous plant he be expend his energy in endeavour to recall the word of the song which his cousin have sing the evening before or to recollect the exact intonation with which she remark to he that it have be fine day or some other equally momentous observation it follow that as the day of the examination come round the student in his lucid interval begin to feel anxious for the result he have know his work fairly well however at one time and with luck he might pull through he make an energetic attempt to compress month 's reading into week and when the day for the write examination come round he have recover some of his lost ground the paper suit he fairly well and he feel as he leave the hall that he have have well fortune than he deserve theviva voceordeal be the one however which he know would be most dangerous to he and he dread it accordingly it be raw spring morning when his turn come to go up his father andkate drive round with he to the university gate "keep up your pluck tom the old gentleman say be cool and have all your wit about you do n't lose your head whatever you do ""i seem to have forget the little ever know tom say dolefully as he trudge up the step as he look back he see kate wave her hand to he cheerily and it give he fresh heart "we shall hope to see you at lunch time his father shout after he mind you bring we good news as he speak the carriage rattle away down the bridges and tom join the knot of expectant student who be wait at the door of the great hall melancholy group they be sallow faced long visage and dolorous partly from the effect of long course of study and partly from their present trepidation it be painful to observe their attempt to appear confident and unconcerned as they glance round the heavens as if to observe the state of the weather or examine with well feign archaeological fervour the inscription upon the old university wall most painful of all be it when some one pluck up courage would venture upon tiny joke at which the whole company would gibber in an ostentatious way as though to show that even in this dire pass the appreciation of humour still remain with they at time when any of their number allude to the examination or detail the question which have be propound to brown or baker the day before the mask of unconcern would be drop and the whole assembly would glare eagerly and silently at the speaker generally on such occasion matter be make infinitely bad by some job 's comforter who creep about suggest abstruse question and hint that they represent some examiner 's particular hobby such one come to dimsdale 's elbow and quench the last ray of hope which linger in the young man 's bosom "what do you know about cacodyl be his impressive question "cacodyl tom cry aghast it be some sort of antediluvian reptile be n't it?"the questioner break into sickly smile no he say it be an organic explosive chemical compound you be sure to be ask about cacodyl tester 's dead on it he ask every one how it be prepared "tom much perturb at these tiding be feverishly endeavour to extract some little information from his companion concern the compound
