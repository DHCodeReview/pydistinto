the dining room although not whisper have be hear of it in ordinary commercial circle there be some foundation for the forecast which von baumser have make as to the fate of the great house of girdlestone for some time back matter have be go badly with the african trader if the shrewd eye of major tobias clutterbuck be unable to detect any indication of this state of affair in the manner or conversation of the junior partner the reason simply be that that gentleman be entirely ignorant of the imminent danger which hang over his head as far as he know the concern be as prosperous and as flourish as it have be at the time of the death of john harston the momentous secret be lock in the breast of his grim old father who bear it about with he as the spartan lad do the fox without quiver or groan to indicate the care which be gnaw at his heart place face to face with ruin girdlestone fight against it desperately and withal coolly and warily throw away no chance and leave no stone unturned above all he exert himself and exert himself successfully to prevent any rumour of the critical position of the firm from leak out in the city he know well that should that once occur nothing could save he as the wound buffalo be gore to death by the herd so the crippled man of business may give up all hope when once his position be know by his fellow at present although von baumser and few other such ishmaelites might have an inkling from source of their own as to how matter stand the name of girdlestone be still regard by business man as the very synonym for commercial integrity and stability if anything there seem to be more business in fenchurch street and more luxury at the residence at eccleston square than in former day only the stern face and silent senior partner know how thin the veneer be which shine so deceptively upon the surface many thing have contribute towards this state of affair the firm have be involve in succession of misfortune some know to the world and other know to no one save the eld girdlestone the former have be accept with such perfect stoicism and cheerfulness that they rather increase than diminish the reputation of the concern the latter be the more crushing and also the more difficult to bear line of fine vessel from liverpool and from hamburg be run to the west coast of africa and competition have cut down freightage to the low possible point where the girdlestones have once hold almost monopoly there be now many in the field again the negro of the coast be becoming educate and have keen eye to business so that the old profit be no long obtainable the day have go by when flint lock gun and manchester print could be weigh in the balance against ivory and gold dust while these general cause be at work special misfortune have befall the house of girdlestone find that their fleet of old sailing vessel be too slow and clumsy to compete with more modern ship they have buy in two first rate steamer one be theprovidence fine screw vessel of twelve hundred ton and the other be theevening star somewhat small in size but both class a1 at lloyd 's the former cost twenty two thousand pound and the latter seventeen thousand now mr. girdlestone have always have weakness for petty saving and in this instance he determine not to insure his new vessel if the crazy old tub for which he have pay fancy premium for so many year with an eye to an ultimate profit meet with no disaster surely those new powerful clipper be safe with their tonnage and horse power they appear to he to be superior to all the danger of the deep it chance however by that strange luck which would almost make one believe that matter nautical be at the mercy of some particularly malignant demon that as theevening starwa steam up channel in dense fog on her return from her second voyage she run right into theprovidence which have start that very morning from liverpool upon her third outward trip theprovidencewas almost cut in two and sink within five minute take down the captain and six of the crew while theevening starwa so much damage about the bow that she put into falmouth in sink condition that day 's work cost the african firm more than five and thirty thousand pound other mishap have occur to weaken the firm apart from their trade with the coast the senior partner have engage in speculation without the knowledge of his son and the result have be disastrous one of the cornish tin mine in which he have sink large amount of money and which have hitherto yield he handsome return become suddenly exhausted and the share go down to zero no firm could stand against such run of bad luck and the african trading company reel before it john girdlestone have not say word yet of all this to his son as claim arise he settle they in the good manner he could and postpone the inevitable day when he should have to give true account of their financial position he hope against hope that the chapter of accident or the arrival of some brilliant cargo from the coast might set the concern on its leg again from day to day he have be expect news of one of his vessel at last one morning he find telegram await he at the office he tear it eagerly open for it bear the madeira mark it be from his agent jose alveciras and announce that the voyage from which he have hope so much have be total failure the cargo be hardly sufficient to defray the working expense as the merchant read it his head drop over the table and he groan aloud another of the prop which uphold he from ruin have snap beneath he there be three letter lie beside the telegram he glance through they but there be no consolation in any of they one be from bank manager inform he that his account be somewhat overdrawn another from lloyd 's insurance agency point out that the policy on two of his vessel would lapse unless pay within certain date the cloud be gather very darkly over the african firm yet the old man bear up against misfortune with dauntless courage he sit alone in his little room with his head sink upon his breast and his thatch eye brow draw down over his keen grey eye it be clear to he that the time have come when he must enlighten his son as to the true state of their affair with his co operation he might carry out plan which have be mature some month in his brain it be hard task for the proud and austere merchant to be compel to confess to his son that he have speculate without his knowledge in the capital of the company and that large part of that capital have disappear these speculation in many instance have promise large return and john girdlestone have withdraw money from safe concern and reinveste it in the hope of get high rate of interest he have do this with his eye open to the risk and know that his son be of too practical and cautious nature to embark in such commercial gambling he have never consult he upon the point nor have he make any entry of the money so invest in the account of the firm hence ezra be entirely ignorant of the danger which hang over they and his father see that in order to secure his energetic assistance in the stroke which he be contemplate it be absolutely necessary that he should know how critical their position be the old man have hardly come to this conclusion when he hear the sharp footfall of his son in the outer office and the harsh tone of his voice as he address the clerk moment or two later the green baize door fly open and the young man come in throw his hat and coat down on one of the chair it be evident that something have ruffle his temper "good morning he say brusquely nod his head to his father "good morning ezra the merchant answer meekly "what be the matter with you father his son ask look at he
