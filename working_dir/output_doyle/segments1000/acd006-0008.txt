the bright little bonnet and ezra girdlestone look down at she from the drawing room window bethought he that if the diamond speculation should fail it would be no hardship to turn to his father 's word the revelation of the real state of the firm 's finance be terrible blow to ezra girdlestone to man of his overbearing tempestuous disposition failure and poverty be bitter thing to face he have be wo nt to tread down before he all such little difficulty and obstacle as come across he in his former life now he encounter great barrier which could not be pass so easily and he rage and chafe before it it make he still more wroth to think that the fault be none of his all his life he have reckon as matter of course that when his father pass away he would be leave almost millionaire single half hour 's conversation have shatter this delusion and leave he face to face with ruin he lose his sleep and become restless and hollow eyed once or twice he be see the bad for drink in the daytime he be man of strong character however and though somewhat demoralize by the sudden shock he throw away no point in the game which he and his father be play he see clearly that only bold stroke could save they he therefore throw himself heart and soul into the diamond scheme and work out the detail in masterly manner the more he look into it the more convinced he become not only of its feasibility but of its absolute safety it seem as though it be hardly possible that it should fail among other thing he proceed to qualify himself as dealer in diamond it happen that he be acquaint with one of the partner of the firm of fugger stoltz who do the large import trade in precious stone through his kindness he receive practical instruction in the variety and value of diamond and learn to detect

with his impecuniosity and the looseness of his morality as infer from his mode of life might some day make he valuable agent under delicate circumstance as to the old soldier 's own inclination ezra flatter himself that he know the man 's nature to nicety it be simply question of the price to be pay no doubt the figure would be substantial but he recognize with trader 's instinct that the article be superior one and he be content to allow for the quality in estimate the value early one april afternoon the major be strut down st. james 's street frock coated and kid glove with protuberant chest and glittering shoe which peep out from beneath the daintiest of gaiter young girdlestone who have be on the look out from club window run across and intercept he "how be you my dear major he cry

see you?""you'll niver see i any plainer than you do at this very moment the old soldier answer take sidelong glance of suspicion at his companion "ah but wish to speak to you quietly on matter of
