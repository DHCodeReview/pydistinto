might arouse suspicion in the meantime no one know our little game ""except your friend clutterbuck "a dark shadow pass over ezra 's handsome face and his cruel lip tighten in way which bode little good to the old soldier should he ever lie at his mercy it be proud day for the ex medical student when he first enter the counting house of the african firm and realize that he be one of the govern power in that busy establishment tom dimsdale 's mind be an intensely practical one and although he have find the study of science an irksome matter he be able to throw himself into business with uncommon energy and devotion the clerk soon find that the sunburnt athletic look young man intend to be anything but sleep partner and both they and old gilray respect he accordingly the latter have at first be inclined to resent the new arrangement as far as his gentle down trodden nature could resent anything hitherto he have be the monarch of the counting house in the absence of the girdlestones but now high desk have be erect in more central portion of the room and this be for the accommodation of the new comer gilray after his thirty year of service feel this usurpation of his right very keenly but there be such simple kindness about the invader and he be so grateful for any assistance in his new duty that the old clerk 's resentment soon melt away little incident occur which strengthen this kindly feeling it chance that some few day after tom 's first appearance in the office several of the clerk who have not yet quite gauge what manner of man this young gentleman might be take advantage of the absence of the girdlestones to take rise out of the manager one of they great rawbone scotchman name mccalister after one or two minor exhibition of wit conclude by drop heavy ruler over the partition of the old man 's desk in such way that it crash down upon his head as he sat stoop over his writing tom who have be watch the proceeding with baleful eye spring off his stool and make across the office at the offender mccalister seem inclined for moment to brazen it out but there be dangerous sling about tom 's shoulder and flush of honest indignation upon his face do n't mean to hurt he say the scotchman do n't hit he sir cry the little manager beg his pardon say tom between his tooth mccalister stammer out some lame apology and the matter be end it reveal the new partner however in an entirely novel light to the inmate of the counting house that under such circumstance complaint should be carry to the senior be only natural but that the junior should actually take the matter into his own hand and execute lynch law then and there be altogether new phenomenon from that day tom acquire great ascendancy in the office and gilray become his devoted slave this friendship with the old clerk prove to be very useful for by mean of his shrewd hint and patient teach the new comer gain grasp of the business which he could not have attain by any other method girdlestone call he into the office one day and congratulate he upon the progress which he be make my dear young man he say to he in his patriarchal way be delighted to hear of the way in which you identify yourself with the interest of the firm if at first you find work allot to you which may appear to you to be rather menial you must understand that that be simply due to our desire that you should master the whole business from its very foundation ""there be nothing desire well say tom "in addition to the routine of office work and the superintendence of the clerk should wish you to have thorough grasp of all the detail of the shipping and of the loading and unloading of our vessel as well as of the storage of good when land when any of our ship be in should wish you to go down to the dock and to overlook everything which be do "tom bow and congratulate himself inwardly upon these new duty which promise to be interesting "as you grow old say the senior partner you will find it of inestimable value that you have have practical experience of what your subordinate have to do
