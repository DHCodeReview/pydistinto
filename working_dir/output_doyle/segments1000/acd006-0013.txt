to sell at any price in order to save something from the general ruin which they imagine be about to come upon the industry some more long headed or more desperate than their neighbour continue to work their claim and to keep the stone which they find until price might be well as fresh mail come from the cape however each confirm and amplify the ominous news these independent worker grow few and more faint hearted for their boy have to be pay each week and where be the money to come from with which to pay they the dealer too begin to take the alarm and the most tempting offer would hardly induce they to give hard cash in exchange for stone which might prove to be drug in the market everywhere there be misery and stagnation ezra girdlestone be not slow to take advantage of this state of thing but he be too cunning to do so in manner which might call attention to himself or his movement in his wandering he have come across an outcast name farintosh man who have once be clergyman and master of art of trinity college dublin but who be now break down gambler with slend purse and still more slender conscience he still retain plausible manner and an engaging address and these quality first recommend he to the notice of the young merchant couple of day after the receipt of the news from europe ezra send for this fellow and sit with he for some time on the verandah of the hotel talk over the situation "you see farintosh he remark it might be false alarm might it not?"the ex clergyman nod he be man of few word "if it should be it would be an excellent thing for those who buy now "farintosh nod once again "of course ezra continue it look as if the thing be beyond all doubt my experience have teach i however that there be nothing so uncertain as certainty that be what make i think of speculate over this if lose it wo n't hurt i much and might win come out here more for the sake of see little of the world than anything else but now that this have turn up 'll have shy at it ""quite so say farintosh rub his hand "you see ezra continue light cheroot have the name here of have long purse and of know which way the wind blow if be to be see buy other would follow my lead and price would soon be as high as ever now what purpose be to work through you d'ye see you can take out licence and buy in stone on the quiet without attract much attention beat they down as low as you can and give this hotel as your address when they call here they shall be pay which be well than have you carry the money round with you "the clergyman scowl as though he think it be anything but well he do not make any remark however "you can get one or two fellow to help you say ezra 'll pay for their licence ca n't expect you to work all the camp yourself of course if you offer more for stone than care to give that be your look out but if you do your work well you shall not be the loser you shall have percentage on business do and weekly salary as well ""how much money do you care to invest ask farintosh "i'm not particular ezra answer if do thing like to do it well 'll go the length of thirty thousand pound "farintosh be so astonished at the magnitude of the sum that he sink back in his chair in bewilderment why sir he say think just at present you could buy the country for that "ezra laugh we 'll make it go as far as we can he say of course you may buy claim as well as stone ""and have carte blanche to that amount?""certainly ""all right 'll begin this evening say the ex parson and pick up his slouch hat which he still wear somewhat broad in the brim than his comrade in deference to old association he depart upon his mission farintosh be clever man and soon choose two active subordinate these be navvy name burt and williams young welshman who have disappear from home behind cloud of forge cheque and having change his name have make fresh start in life to the south of the equator these three work day and night buying in stone from the more needy and impecunious miner to whom ready money be matter of absolute necessity farintosh buy in the stock too of several small dealer whose nerve have be shake by the panic in this way bag after bag be fill with diamond by ezra while he himself be to all appearance do nothing but smoke cigar and sip brandy and water in front of thecentral hotel he be become somewhat uneasy in his mind as to how long the delusion would be keep up or how soon news might come from the cape that the ural find have be examine into and have prove to be myth in any case he think that he would be free from suspicion still it might be as well for he by that time to be upon his homeward journey for he know that if by any chance the true fact leak out there would be no hope of mercy from the furious digger hence he incite farintosh to great speed and that worthy divine with his two agent work so energetically that in less than week there be little left of five and thirty thousand pound ezra girdlestone have show his power of read character when he choose the ex clergyman as his subordinate it be possible however that the young man 's judgment have be inferior to his power of observation clever man as trusty ally be valuable article but when the say cleverness may be turn against his employer the advantage become questionable one it be perfectly evident to farintosh that though stray capitalist might risk thousand pound or so on speculation of this sort rothschild himself would hardly care to invest such sum as have pass through his hand without have some ground on which to go having form this conclusion and having also turn over in his mind the remarkable coincidence that the news of this discovery in russia should follow so very rapidly upon the visit of the junior partner of the house of girdlestone the astute clergyman begin to have some dim perception of the truth hence he brood good deal as he go about his work and cogitate deeply in manner which be once again distinctly undesirable in so very intelligent subordinate these brooding and cogitation culminate in meeting which be hold by he with his two sub agent in the private parlour of the digger 's retreat it be low roof smoke stain room with profusion of spittoon scatter over it which to judge by the condition of the floor the patron of the establishment have take some pain to avoid round solid old fashioned table in the centre of this apartment sit ezra 's staff of assistant the parson thoughtful but self satisfied the other sullen and inquisitive farintosh have convene the meeting and his comrade have an idea that there be something in the wind they apply themselves steadily therefore to the bottle of holland upon the table and wait for he to speak "well the ex clergyman say at last the game be nearly over and we 'll not be want any more girdlestone 's off to england in day or two "burt and williams groan sympathetically work be scarce in the digging during the crisis and their agency have be pay they well "yes he be off farintosh go on glance keenly at his companion and he take with he five and thirty thousand pound worth of diamond that we buy for he poor devil like we burt have to do the work and then be throw aside as you would throw your pick aside when you be do with it when he sell out in london and make his pile it wo n't much matter to he that the three man who help he be starve in griqualand ""won't he give we somethin' at partin ask burt the navvy he be savage look hairy man with brick colour face and over hang eyebrow wo n't he give we nothing to remembrance he by?""give you something farintosh say with sneer why man he say you be too well pay already ""doe he though cry the navvy flush even red than nature have make he be that the way he speak after we make he it ai n't on the square like to see thing honest an above board betwixt man an man and this pitchin of they as have help ye over ai n't that "farintosh lower his voice and bend far over the table his companion involuntarily imitate his movement until the three cunning cruel face be look closely into one another 's eye "nobody know that he hold those stone say farintosh he be too smart to let it out to any one but ourselves ""where do he keep 'em ask the welshman "in safe in his room ""where be the key?""on his watch chain ""could we get an impression?""i have one ""then can make one cry williams triumphantly "it be do say farintosh take small key from his pocket this be duplicate and will open the safe take the moulding from his key while be speak to he "the navvy laugh hoarsely if that do n't lick creation for smartness he cry and how be we to get to this safe it would serve he right if we collar the lot it 'll teach he that if he ai n't honest by nature he be get to be when he deal with the like of we like straightness and by the lord 'll have it he bring his great fist down upon the table to emphasize this commendable sentiment "it be not an easy matter farintosh say thoughtfully when he go out he lock his door and there be no get in at the window there be only one chance for we that can see his room be bit cut off from the rest of the hotel there be gallery of twenty foot or more that lead to it now be think that if the three of we be to visit he some evening just to wish he luck on his journey as it be and if while we be in the room something sudden be to happen which would knock he silly for minute or two we might walk off with the stone and be clean go before he could raise an alarm ""and what would knock he silly ask williams he be an unhealthy scorbutic look youth and his pallid complexion have assume greenish tinge of fear as he listen to the clergyman 's word he have the making in he of mean and dangerous criminal but not of violent one belong to the jackal tribe rather than to the tiger "what would knock he senseless farintosh ask burt with knowing look burt laugh again in his bushy red beard you can leave that to i mate he say williams glance from one to the other and he become even more cadaverous be not in it he stammer it will be hang job you will kill he as like as not ""not in it ai n't ye growl the navvy why you white livere hound you be too deep in it ever to get out again d'ye think we 'll let you spoil lay of this sort as we might never get chance of again?""you can do it without i say the welshman tremble in every limb "and have you turnin on we the moment reward be offer no no chummy you do n't get out of it that way if you wo n't stand by we 'll take care you do n't split ""think of the diamond farintosh put in "think of your own skin say the navvy "you could go back to england rich man if you do it ""you'll never go back at all if you do n't thus work upon alternately by his hope and by his fear williams show some sign of yield he take long draught from his glass and fill it up again "i ai n't afraid he say do n't imagine that be afraid you wo n't hit he very hard mr. burt?""just enough to curl he up the navvy answer lord love ye it ai n't the first man by many one that 've lay on his back though never have the chance before of finger five and thirty thousand pound worth of diamond for my pain ""but the hotel keeper and the servants?""that be all right say farintosh you leave it to i if we go up quietly and openly and come down quietly and openly who be to suspect anything our horse will be outside in woodley street and we 'll be out of their reach in no time shall we say to morrow evening for the job?""that be very early williams cry tremulously "the soon the well burt say with an oath and look here young man fix williams with his bloodshot eye one sign of draw back and by the live jingo 'll let you have more than be keep for he you hear i eh he grasp the youth 's white wrist and squeeze it in his iron grip until he writhe with the pain "oh be with you heart and soul he cry be sure what you andmr farintosh advise must be for the good ""meet here at eight o'clock to morrow night then say the leader "we can get it over by nine and we will have the night for our escape i'll have the horse ready and it will be strange if we do n't get sucha start as will puzzle they

camp which be the scene of their labour the meeting just describe take place upon tuesday early in november on the saturday ezra girdlestone have fully make up his mind to turn his back upon the digging and begin his homeward journey he be pine for the pleasure of his old london life and be weary of the monotonous expanse of the south african veldt his task be do too and it would be well for he to be at distance before the digger discover the manner in which they have be hoax he begin to pack his box therefore and to make every preparation for his departure he be busily engage in this employment upon the wednesday evening when there be tap at the door and farintosh walk in accompany by burt and williams girdlestone glance up at they and greet they briefly he be not surprised at their visit for they have come together several time before to report progress or make arrangement farintosh bow as he enter the room burt nod and williams rub his hand together and look amiably

your voice in my presence 'll give you the sound hiding that ever you have in your life "ezra have stand up and show every indication of be as good as his word "don't let we quarrel the last time we may meet farintosh cry intervene between the two it be not money we expect from you all we want be drain of rum to drink success to you with ""oh if that be all say the young merchant and turn round to pick up the bottle which stand on table behind he quick as flash burt spring upon he and strike he down with life preserver with gasp cry and heavy thud ezra fall face downward upon the floor the bottle still clutch in his senseless hand and the escape rum form horrible mixture with the blood which stream from great gash in his head "very neat very pretty indeed cry the ex parson in quiet tone of critical satisfaction as connoisseur might speak of speciman which interest he he be already busy at the door of the safe "well do mr. burt well do cry williams in quiver voice and go up to the body he kick it in the side you see be not afraid mr. burt be i?""stow your gab snarl the navvy here be the rum all gettin loose "picke up the bottle he take pull of what be leave in it "here be the

moon as it rise over the veldt that night shine on three horseman spur it along the capetown road as though their very life depend upon their speed its calm clear ray stream over the silent roof of kimberley and in through particular window of thecentral hotel throw silvery patch upon the carpet and cast strange shadow from the figure which lie as it have fall huddle in an ungainly heap upon the floor it might perhaps have be as well for the curtailing of this narrative and for the interest of the world at large if the blow deal by the sturdy right arm of the navvy have cut short once for all the career of the junior african merchant ezra however be endow with rare vitality which enable he not only to shake off the effect of his mishap but to do so in an extraordinarily short space of time there be groan from the prostrate figure then feeble movement then another and loud groan and then an oath gradually raise himself upon his elbow he look around he in bewildered way with his other hand press to the wound at the back of his head from which few narrow little rivulet of blood be still meander his glance wander vaguely over the table and the chair and the wall until it rest upon the safe he could see in the moonlight that it be open and empty in moment the whole circumstance of the case come back to he and he stagger to the door with hoarse cry of rage and of despair whatever ezra 's fault may have be irresolution or want of courage be not among they in moment he grasp the situation and realize that it be absolutely essential that he should act and at once the stone must be recover or utter and irretrievable ruin stare he in the face at his cry the landlord and several attendant white and black come rush into the room "i've be rob and assault ezra say steady himself against the mantelpiece for he be still weak and giddy do n't all start cackle but do what ask you light the lamp!"the lamp be light and there be murmur from the little knot of employee reinforce by some late lounger at the bar as they see the disorder room and the great crimson patch upon the carpet "the thief call at nine say ezra talk rapidly but collectedly their name be farintosh burt and williams we talk for some little time so they probably do not leave the house before quarter past at the soon it be now half past ten so they have no very great start you jamieson and you van muller
