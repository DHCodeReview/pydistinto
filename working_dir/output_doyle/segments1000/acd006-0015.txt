heart and courage and it break the dull monotony of her dreary life occasionally as we have see he even manage to find his way into the interior of this ogre 's castle in which his fair princess be immure john girdlestone put an end to this by order that business message should never under any circumstance be convey to his private residence nothing daunt however the lover soon devise another mean of surmount the barrier which divide they the centre of the square be take up by garden rectangular and uninviting fence round with high forbid wall which shut out all intruder and give the place resemblance to the exercise ground of prison within the rail be clump of bush and here and there few despondent tree droop their head as though mourn over the uncongenial site in which they have be plant among these tree and bush there be scatter seat and the whole estate be at the disposal of the inhabitant of eccleston square and be dignify by the name of the eccleston gardens this be the only spot in which kate be trust without the surveillance of footman and it be therefore favourite haunt of her where she would read or work for hour under the shelter of the scanty foliage hence it come about that one day as thomas dimsdale be make his way cityward at rather early hour than be customary with he he miss the usual apparition at the window look round blankly in search of some explanation of this absence he perceive in the garden pretty white bonnet which glint among the leave and on close inspection pair of bright eye which survey he merrily from underneath it the gate be open and in less time than it take to tell it the sacrilegious foot of the young man have invade the sacred domain devote to the sole use and behoof of the ecclestonians it may be imagine that he be somewhat late at the office that morning and on many subsequent morning until the clerk begin to think that their new employer be lose the enthusiasm for business which have possess he tom frequently beg permission to inform mr. girdlestone of his engagement but kate be inflexible upon that point the fact be that she know her guardian 's character very much well than her lover do and remember his frequent exhortation upon the subject of the vanity and wickedness of such thing she fear the effect of his anger when he learn the truth in year or so she would be of age and her own mistress but at present she be entirely in his power why should she subject herself to the certainty of constant harshness and unkindness which would await she have her guardian really fulfil the function of father towards she he would have right to be inform but as it be she feel that she owe he no such duty she therefore make up her mind that he should know nothing of the matter but the fate unfortunately will otherwise it chance that one morning the interview between the lover have last rather long than usual and have be conclude by kate 's return to the house while tom remained sit upon the garden seat lose in such reverie as affect man in his position while thus pleasantly employ his thought be suddenly recall to earth by the appearance of dark shadow on the gravel in front of he and look up he see the senior partner stand short distance away and regard he with anything but an amiable expression upon his face he have himself be have morning stroll in the garden and have oversee the whole of the recent interview without the preoccupied lover be aware of his presence "are you come to the office he ask sternly if so we can go together "tom rise and follow he out of the garden without word he know from the other 's expression that all be know to he and in his heart he be not sorry his only fear be that the old man 's anger might fall upon his ward and this he determine to prevent they walk side by side as far as the station in complete silence but on reach fenchurch street girdlestone ask his young partner to step into his private sanctum "now sir he say as he close the door behind he think that have right to inquire what the meaning may be of the scene of which be an involuntary witness this morning?""it mean tom answer firmly but gently that be engage to missharston and have be for some time ""oh indeed girdlestone answer coldly sit down at his desk and turn over the pile of letter "at my request say tom our engagement be keep from your knowledge have reason to believe that you object to early engagement and fear that our might be disagreeable to you trust that the record angel will not register very black mark against our friend for this the one and only falsehood that ever pass his lip during the long silent walk the merchant have be revolve in his mind what course he should pursue and he have come to the conclusion that it be more easy to guide this impetuous stream of youth than to attempt to stem it he do not realize the strength of the tie that bind these two young people together and imagine that with judgment and patience it might yet be snap it be therefore with as good an imitation of geniality as his angular visage would permit of that he answer his companion 's confession "you can hardly wonder at my be surprised he say such thing never enter my mind for moment you would have do well to have confide in i before ""i must ask your pardon for not having do so ""as far as you be concerned say john girdlestone affably believe you to be hard work and right principle your conduct since you have join the firm have be everything which could desire "tom bow his acknowledgment much pleased by this preamble "with regard to my ward continue the senior partner speak very slowly and evidently weigh his word could not wish she to have well husband in consider such question have however as you may imagine to consult above everything else the wish of my dead friend mr. john harston the father of the young lady to whom you say that you be engaged trust have be repose in i and that trust must of course be fulfil to the letter ""certainly say tom wonder in his own mind how he could ever have bring himself for one moment to think evil of this kindly and righteous old man "it be one of mr. harston 's most clearly express wish that no word or even thought of such matter should be allow to come in his daughter 's way until she have attain maturity by which he mean the age of one and twenty ""but he could not foresee the circumstance tom plead be sure that year or so will make no difference in her sentiment in this matter ""my duty be to carry out his instruction to the letter wo n't say however continue mr. girdlestone that circumstance might not arise which might induce i to shorten this probationary period if my further acquaintance with you confirm the high impression which now have of your commercial ability that of course would have weight with i and again if find miss harston 's mind be make up upon the point that also would influence my judgment ""and what be we to do in the mean time ask the junior partner anxiously "in the mean time neither you nor your people must write to she or speak to she or hold any communication with she whatever if find you or they do so shall be compel in justice to mr. harston 's last request to send she to some establishment abroad where she shall be entirely out of your way my mind be irrevocably make up upon that point it be not matter of personal inclination but of conscience ""and how long be this to last cry tom "it will depend upon yourself if you prove yourself to be man of honour in this matter may be incline to sanction your address in the mean time you must give i your word to let it rest and neither to attempt to speak to miss harston nor to see she nor to allow your parent to communicate with she the last condition may seem to you to be hard but in my eye it be very important one unless you can bring yourself to promise all this my duty will compel i to remove my ward entirely out of your reach course which would be painful to she and inconvenient to myself ""but must let she know of this arrangement must tell she that you hold out hope to we on condition that we keep apart for time ""it would be cruel not to allow you to do that girdlestone answer you may send heroneletter but remember there shall be no reply to it ""thank you sir thank you tom cry fervently have something to live for now this separation will but make our heart grow fonder what change can time make in either of us?""quite so say john girdlestone with smile remember there must be no more walk through the square you must remain absolutely apart if you wish to gain my consent ""it be hard very very hard but will promise to do it what wouldi not promise which would lead to our early union?""that be settle then in the mean time should be oblige if you would go down to the dock and look after the loading of the transferable corrugate iron house for new calabar ""all right sir and thank you for your kindness say tom bow himself out he hardly know whether to be pleased or grieve over the result of his interview but on the whole satisfaction prevail since at the bad it be but to wait for year or so while there seem to be some hope of gain the guardian 's consent before that on the other hand he have pledge himself to separate from kate but that would he reflect only make their re union the sweeter all the morning he be engage in superintend the stowing of great slab of iron in the capacious hold of themaid of athens when the hour of luncheon arrive no thought of food be in the lad 's head but bury himself in the back parlour of little blackwall public house he call for pen ink and paper and proceed to indite letter to his sweetheart never be so much love and comfort and advice and hope compress into the limit of four sheet of paper or contain in the narrow boundary of single envelope tom read it over after he have finish and feel that it feebly express his thought but then what lover ever yet do succeed in get his thought satisfactorily represent upon paper having post this effusion in which he have carefully explain the condition impose upon he tom feel considerably more light hearted and return with renew vigour to the loading of the corrugate iron he would hardly have feel so satisfied have he see john girdlestone receive that same letter from the hand of the footman and read it afterwards in the privacy of his bedroom with sardonic smile upon his face still less contented would he have be have he beheld the merchant tear it into small fragment and make bonfire of it in his capacious grate next morning kate look in vain out of the accustomed window and be sore at heart when no tall figure appear in sight and no friendly hand wave morning salutation this episode have occur about fortnight before ezra 's return fromafrica and be duly retailed to he by his father "you need not be discourage by that he say can always keep they apart and if he be absent and you be present especially as she have no idea of the cause of his absence she will end by feeling slight and prefer you ""i can not understand how you ever come to let the matter go so far his son answer sullenly what do the young puppy want to come poach upon our preserve for the girl belong to we she be give to you to look after and nice job you seem to have make of it!""never mind my boy reply the merchant 'll answer for keep they apart if you will only push the matter on your own account ""i've say that would do so and will ezra return and event soon show that he be as good as his word before his african excursion the relation between young girdlestone and his father 's ward have never be cordial kate 's nature however be so sweet and forgive that it be impossible for she to harbour any animosity and she greet ezra kindly on his return from his travel within few day she become conscious that remarkable change have come over he change as it seem to she very much for the well in the past week have frequently elapse without his address she but now he go out of his way to make himself agreeable sometimes he would sit for whole evening describe to she all that he have see in africa and really interesting she by his account of man and thing she poor lass hail this new departure with delight and do all in her power to encourage his well nature and to show that she appreciate the alteration in his bearing at the same time she be rather puzzled in her mind for an occasional flash of coarseness or ferocity show she that the real nature of the man be unaltered and that he be put an unnatural restraint upon himself as the day go on and no word or sign come from tom great fear and perplexity arise within the girl 's mind she have hear nothing of the interview at fenchurch street nor have she any clue at all which could explain the mystery could it be that tom have inform her guardian of their engagement and have receive such rebuff that he have abandon she in despair that be surely impossible yet why be it that he have cease to walk through the square she know that he be not ill because she hear she two companion talk of he in connection with business what could be the matter then her little heart be tear by thousand conflict doubt and fear in the mean time ezra give fresh manifestation of the improvement which travel have work upon he she have remark one day that she be fond of moss rose on come down to breakfast next morning she find beautiful moss rise upon her plate and every morning afterwards fresh flower appear in the same place this pretty little piece of courtesy which she know could only come from ezra surprise and please she for delicacy be the last quality for which she would have give he credit on another occasion she have express desire to read thackeray 's work the book in the library be for the most part of last century on enter her room that same evening she find to her astonishment handsomely bind edition of the novel in question stand on the centre of her table for moment wild unreasoning hope awake in she that perhaps this be tom 's do that he have take this means of show that she be still dear to he she soon see however that the book could only have come from the same source as the flower and she marvel more than ever at this fresh proof of the good will of her companion one day her guardian take the girl aside your life must be rather dull he say have take box for you to night at the opera do not care about such spectacle myself but have make arrangement for your escort change will do you good "poor kate be too sad at heart to be incline for amusement she endeavour however to look pleased and grateful "my good friend mrs. wilkinson be come for you the merchant say and ezra be go too he have great liking for music "kate could not help smile at this last remark as she think how very successfully the young man have conceal his taste during the year that she have know he she be ready however at the appoint hour and mrs. wilkinson prim old gentlewoman who have chaperone kate on the rare occasion when she go out having arrive the three drive off together the opera happen to be faust and the magnificent scenery and dress astonish kate who have hardly ever before be within the wall of theatre she sit as if entrance with bright tinge of colour upon her cheek which with her sparkle eye make she look surpassingly beautiful so think ezra girdlestone as he sit in the recess of the box and watch the varied expression which flit across her mobile feature she be well worth have money or no he mutter to himself and redouble his attention to she during the evening an incident occur between the act that night which would have please the old merchant have he witness it kate have be look down from the box which be upon the third tier at the sea of head beneath they suddenly she give start and her face grow trifle paler "isn't that mr. dimsdale down there she say to her companion "where ask ezra crane his neck oh yes there he be in the second row of the stall ""do you know who the young lady be that he be talk to kate ask "i do n't know say ezra have see he about with she good deal lately the latter be deliberate falsehood but ezra see his chance of prejudice his rival and take prompt advantage of it she be very good look he add presently keep his eye upon his companion "oh indeed say kate and turn with some common place remark to mrs. wilkinson her heart be sore nevertheless and she derive little pleasure from the remainder of the performance as to ezra in spite of his great love for music he doze peacefully in corner of the box during the whole of the last act none of they be sorry when faust be duly consign to the nether region and marguerite be apotheose upon couple of wooden cloud ezra narrate the incident of the recognition in the stall to his father on his return and the old gentleman rub his hand over it "most fortunate he exclaim gleefully by work on that idea we might produce great effect who be the girl do you know?""some poor relation believe whom he trot out at time ""we will find out her name and all about she capital capital cry john girdlestone and the two worthy depart to their room much pleased at this new card which chance have put into their hand during the weary week while tom dimsdale in accordance with his promise avoid eccleston square and everything which could remind kate of his existence ezra continue to leave no stone unturned in his endeavour to steal his way into her affection poor tom 's sole comfort be the recollection of that last passionate letter which he have write in the blackwall public house and which have as he imagine enlighten she as to the reason of his absence and have prevent she from feel any uneasiness or surprise have he know the fate that have befall that epistle he would hardly have be able to continue his office duty so patiently or to wait with so much resignation for mr. girdlestone 's sanction to his engagement as the day pass and still bring no news kate 's face grow paler and her heart more weary and despond that the young man be well be beyond dispute since she have see he with her own eye at the opera what explanation could there be then for his conduct be it possible that he have tell mr. girdlestone of their engagement and that her guardian have find some mean of dissuade he from continue his suit find some appeal to his interest perhaps which be too strong for his love all that she know of tom 's nature contradict such supposition again if girdlestone have learn anything of their engagement surely he would have reproach she with it his manner of late have be kind rather than harsh on the other hand could it have chance that tom have meet this lady of the opera and that her charm have prove too much for his constancy when she think of the honest grey eye which have look down into hers at that last meeting in the garden she find it hard to imagine the possibility of such thing and yet there be fact which have to be explain the more she think of it the more incomprehensible it grow but still the pale face grow paler and the sad heart more heavy soon however her doubt and fear begin to resolve themselves into something more substantial than vague conjecture the conversation of the girdlestones use to turn upon their business colleague and always in the same strain there be stray remark about his doing hint from the father and laughter from the son not much work to be get out of he now the old man would say when man be in love he be not over fond of ledger ""a nice look girl too say ezra in answer to some such remark think something would come of it we see they together at the opera do n't we kate?"so they would gossip together and every word stab to the poor girl she strove to conceal her feeling and indeed her anger and her pride be strong even than her grief for she feel that she have be cruelly use one day she find girdlestone alone and unbosom herself to he "is it really true she ask with quick pant and catch of her breath that mr. dimsdale be engaged to be married?""i believe so my dear her guardian answer it be commonly report so when young lady and gentleman correspond it be usually sign of something of the sort ""oh they correspond?""yes they certainly correspond her letter be send to he at the office do n't know that altogether like that arrangement it look as if he be deceive his parent all this be an unmitigated lie but girdlestone have go too far now to stick at trifle "who be the lady ask kate with calm set face but quiver lip "a cousin of his miss ossary be her name believe be not sorry for it may be sign that he have sow all his wild oats do you know at one time kate fear that he might take fancy to you he have specious way with he and feel my responsibility in the matter ""you need not be afraid on that score kate say bitterly think can gauge mr. dimsdale 's specious manner at its proper value with this valiant speech she march off head in air to her room and there weep as though her very heart would break john girdlestone tell his son of this scene as they walk home from fenchurch street that same day we must look sharp over it he say or that young fool may get impatient and upset our plan ""it be not such an easy matter say his son gloomily get along so far but no far it be more uphill job than expect ""why you have bad enough name among woman the merchant say with something approach to sneer have be grieve time out of number by your looseness in that respect should have think that you might have make your experience of some use now ""there be woman and woman his son remark girl like this take as much manage as skittish horse ""once get she into harness and warrant you 'll keep she there quiet enough ""you bet say ezra with loud laugh but at present she have the pull her mind be still run on that fellow ""she speak bitterly enough of he this morning ""so she might but she think of he none the less if could once make she thoroughly realize that he have throw she over might catch she on the hop she 'd marry for spite if she would n't for love ""just so just so wait bit that can be manage think if you will leave it to i "the old man brood over the problem all day for from week to week the necessity for the money be become more pressing and that money could only be hope for through the success of ezra 's wooing no wonder that every little detail which
