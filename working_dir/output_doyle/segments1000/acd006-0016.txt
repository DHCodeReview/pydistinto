should like to have word with you he say graciously when his junior partner appear before he to consult with he as to the duty of the day tom sit down with hope in his heart "it be only fair to you mr. dimsdale girdlestone say in kindly voice that should express to you my appreciation of your honourable conduct you have keep your promise in regard to miss harston in the full manner ""of course keep my promise say tom bluntly trust however that you will soon see your way to withdraw your prohibition it have be hard trial to i ""i have insist upon it because it seem to i to be my duty every one take his own view upon such point and it have always be my custom throughout life to take what some might think stringent one it appear to i that owe it to my deceased friend to prevent his daughter whom he have confide to i from make any mistake as say before if you continue to show that you be worthy of she may think more favourably of it exemplary as your conduct have be since you join we believe that be not wrong in state that you be little wild when you be at edinburgh ""i never do anything that be ashamed of say tom "very likely not girdlestone answer with an irrepressible sneer "the question be do you do anything that your father be ashamed of?""certainly not cry tom hotly be no milksop or psalm singer but there be nothing that ever do there of which should be ashamed of my father know ""don't speak lightly of psalm singing it be good practice in its way and you would have be none the bad have you indulge in it perhaps however that be neither here nor there what want you clearly to understand be that my ultimate consent to your union depend entirely upon your own conduct above all insist that you refrain from unsettle the girl 's mind at present ""i have already promise hard as the struggle may be shall not break my word have the consolation of know that if we be separate for twenty year we should still be true to one another ""that be very satisfactory say the merchant grimly "nevertheless it be weary weary time if could only write line not word girdlestone interrupt it be only because trust you that keep she in london at all if think there be possibility of your do such thing should remove she at once ""i shall do nothing without your permission tom say take up his hat to go he pause with his hand upon the door if ever it seem good to i he say consider that by give you due notice absolve myself from my promise ""you would not do anything so foolish ""still reserve myself the right of do so say tom and go off with heavy heart to his day 's work "everythe be clear for you now the old man say to his son triumphantly there be no chance of interference and the girl be in the very humour to be win flatter myself that it have be manage with tact remember that all be at stake and go in and win ""i shall go in say ezra and think the chance be that shall win too "at which reassure speech the old man laugh and slap his son approvingly upon the shoulder in spite of john girdlestone 's temporary satisfaction and the stoical face which he present to the world it be probable that in the whole of london there be no more unhappy and heart weary man the long fight against impending misfortune have shatter his iron constitution and weaken he both in body and in mind it be remark upon change how much he have age of late and moralist comment upon the vanity and inefficacy of the wealth which could not smooth the wrinkle from the great trader 's haggard visage he be surprise himself when he look in the glass at the change which have come over he never mind he would say in his dogged heart hundred time day they ca n't beat i do what they will they ca n't beat i this be the one thought which sustain and console he the preservation of his commercial credit have become the aim and object of his life to which there be nothing that he be not prepared to sacrifice his cunningly devise speculation in diamond have fail but this failure have be due to an accident which could neither have be foresee nor remedied to carry out this scheme he have as we have see be oblige to borrow money which have now to be repay this he have manage to do more or less completely by the sale of the stone which ezra have bring home supplement by the recent profit of the firm there be still the original deficit to be face and john girdlestone know that though settlement might be postpone from month to month still the day must come and come soon when his debt must be meet or his inability to meet they become apparent to the whole world should ezra be successful in his wooing and his ward 's forty thousand pound be throw into the scale the firm would shake itself clear from the load which oppress it suppose however that kate be to refuse his son what be to occur then the will be so word that there appear to be no other way of obtain the money very vulpine look would come over the old man 's face as he brood over that problem the strange of all the phenomenon however present by john girdlestone at this period of his life be his own entire conviction of the righteousness of his action when every night and morning he sink upon his knee with his household and pray for the success of the firm 's undertaking no qualm of conscience ever trouble he as to their intrinsic morality on sunday the grey head of the merchant in the first pew be as constant an object as be the pew itself yet in that head no thought ever rise of the inconsistency of his religion and of his practice for fifty year he have be persuade himself that he be righteous man and the conviction be now so firmly impressed upon his very soul that nothing could ever shake it ezra be wrong when he set this down as deliberate hypocrisy blind strength of will and self conceit be at the bottom of his action but he would have be astonish and indignant have he be accuse of simulate piety or of use it as tool to he the firm of girdlestone be the very representation of religion in the commercial world and as such must be uphold by every conceivable mean to his son this state of mind be unintelligible and he simply give his father credit for be consummate and accomplished hypocrite who find mantle of piety very convenient one under which to conceal his real character he have himself inherit the old man 's dog pertinacity and commercial instinct and be by nature unscrupulous and impatient of any obstacle place in his way he be now keenly alive to the fact that the existence of the firm depend upon the success of his suit and he know also how lucrative concern the african business would prove be it set upon its leg again he have determine in case he succeed to put his father aside as sleep partner and to take the rein of management entirely into his own hand his practical mind have already devise countless way in which the profit might be increase the first step of all then be the gain possession of the forty thousand pound and to that he devote himself heart and soul when two such man work together for one end it be seldom that they fail to achieve it it would be mistake to suppose that ezra feel himself in any degree in love at this time he recognize his companion 's sweetness and gentleness but these be not quality which appeal to his admiration kate 's amiable quiet way seem insipid to man who be use to female society of very different order "she have no go or snap about she he would complain to his father "she be not like polly lucas at the pavilion or minnie walker ""god forbid ejaculate the merchant that sort of thing be bad enough out of door but bad of all in your own house ""it make court good deal easy ezra answer "if girl will answer up and give you an opening now and then it make all the difference ""you ca n't write poetry can you?""not much ezra say with grin "that be pity believe it go long way with woman you might get some one to write some and let she think it be yours or you could learn little off and repeat it ""yes might do that be go to buy collar for that beast of dog of hers all the time that be talk to she yesterday she be so take up with it that do n't believe she hear half that say my finger itch to catch it up and chuck it through the window ""don't forget yourself my boy do n't forget yourself cry the merchant single false step might ruin every thing ""never fear ezra say confidently and go off upon the dog collar mission while he be in the shop he buy dog whip as well which he lock up in his drawer to use as the occasion serve during all this time kate have be entirely unconscious of her companion 's intention and design she have be associate with ezra for so many year and have meet such undeviated want of courtesy from he that the idea of his present himself as suitor never come into her head she hail his charge of demeanour therefore as be the result of his large experience of the world and often wonder how it be that he have profit so much by his short stay at the cape in the cheerless house it be pleasant to have at least one companion who seem to have kindly feeling towards she she be only too glad therefore to encourage his advance and to thank he with sweet smile and eloquent eye for what appear to she to be his disinterested kindness after while however ezra 's attention become so marked that it be impossible for she to misunderstand they any long not only do he neglect his usual work in order to hang round she from morning to night but he pay she many clumsy compliment and give other similar indication of the state of his affection as soon as this astounding fact have be fairly realize by the girl she at once change her manner and become formal and distant ezra nothing daunt redouble his tender word and glance and once would have kiss her hand have she not rapidly withdraw it on this kate shut herself up in her room and rarely come out save when the other be away in the city she be determined that there should be no possibility of any misunderstanding as to her feeling in the matter john girdlestone have be watch these little skirmish closely and with keen interest when kate take to immure herself in her room he feel that it be time for he to interfere "you must go about little more and have more fresh air he say to she one day when they be alone after breakfast you will lose your rose if you don't ""i be sure do n't care whether lose they or not answer his ward listlessly "you may not but there be other who do remark the merchant "i believe it would break ezra 's heart "kate flush up at this sudden turn of the conversation do n't see what reason your son have to care about it she say "care about it be you so blind that you do n't see that he love the very ground you walk on he have grow quite pale and ill these last few day because he have not see you and he imagine that he may have offend you ""for goodness sake cry kate earnestly persuade he to think of some one else it will only be painful both to he and to i if he keep on this way it can not possibly lead to anything ""and why not why should oh do n't let we argue about it she cry passionately the very idea be horrible it wo n't bear talk about ""but why my dear why you be really too impulsive ezra have his fault but what man have not he have be little wild in his youth but he be settle down now into an excellent man of business assure you that young as he be there be few name more respected on change the way in which he manage the business of the firm in africa be wonderful he be already rich man and will be rich before he die can not see any cause for this deep rooted objection of yours as to look he be you must confess as fine young fellow as there be in london ""i wish you not to speak of it or think of it again say kate my mind be entirely make up when say that shall never marry any one he least of all ""you will think well of it be sure her guardian say pat her chestnut hair kindly as he stand over she since your poor father hand you over to i have guard you and care for you to the good of my ability many sleepless night have spend thinking of your future and endeavour to plan it out so as to secure your happiness should not be likely to give you bad advice now or urge you to take step which would make you unhappy have you anything to complain of in my treatment of you?""you have be always very just kate say with sob "and this be how you repay i you be go to break my son 's heart and through his mine he be my only boy and if anything go wrong with he tell you that it would bring my grey hair in sorrow to the grave you have it in your power to do this or on the other hand you may make my old age happy one by the knowledge that the lad be mate with good woman and have attain the object on which his whole mind and heart be set ""oh ca n't ca n't do let the matter drop ""think it over the old man say look at it from every point of view remember that the love of an honest man be not to be lightly spurned be naturally anxious about it for my future happiness as well as his depend upon your decision "john girdlestone be fairly satisfied with this interview it seem to he that his ward be rather less decide in her refusal at the end of it and that his word have have some effect upon she which might possibly increase with reflection "give she little time now be his advice to his son think she will come round but she need manage ""if could get the money without take she it would be well for me,"ezra say with an oath "and well for she too remark john girdlestone grimly one day major tobias clutterbuck be sit at the window of his little room smoke his cigarette and sip his glass of wine as be his custom if time be reasonably good while
