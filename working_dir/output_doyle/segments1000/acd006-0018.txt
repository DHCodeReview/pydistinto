it unless put it out sidevays from under my beard the german say apologetically however if you think it should be hide it shall be so how be my stud button you have they of gold see but mine be of mother of oyster ""mother of pearl say the major laugh they will do very well there be the divil of lot of cab at their door he continue peer round the corner of the blind the room be all light up and can hear they tune the instrument maybe we 'd well go across ""vorvarts then say von baumser resolutely and the two set off the major with fix determination that he should know his fate before the evening be over never in the whole history of morrison 's boarding establishment have such festive preparation be know the landlady herself have enter heart and soul into the business and as all the boarder have receive invitation for themselves and their friend they co operate in every possible manner to make the evening success the large drawing room have be clear and the floor wax this process leave it in very glassy and orthodox condition as the cook discover when on bustle in the back of her cranium come in violent contact with the board while her body describe half circle with velocity which completely eclipse any subsequent feat of agility show by the dancer in the evening the saloon have be very tastefully lay out as supper room and numerous other little chamber be throw open and brighten up to serve as lounge place for those who be fatigued in the parlour there be two card table and every other convenience for any who prefer sedentary amusement altogether both mrs. morrison and the boarder in solemn conclave assemble agree that the thing look very promising and that it would be credit to the establishment the guest be as varied as the wine though hardly as select mrs. scully 's exuberant hospitality include as already intimate not only her own friend but those of her fellow boarder so that from an early hour the room begin to fill and by nine o'clock there be hardly space for the dancer hansom and growler rattle up in continuous stream and discharge their burden there be carpet down from the kerb to the head of the lodging house step like r'yalty as the cook express it and the greengrocer 's man in the hall look so pompous and inflated in his gorgeous attire that his own cabbage would hardly have recognize he his main defect as footman be that he be somewhat hard of hearing and have marvellous faculty of misinterpret whatever be say to he which occasionally lead to remarkable result thus when he announce the sport captain livingstone tuck under the title of captain live on his luck it be feel that he be rather too near the truth to be pleasant indeed the company have hardly recover from the confusion produce by this small incident when the two bohemians make their appearance mrs. scully who be tastefully array in black satin and lace stand near the door of the drawing room and look very charming and captivate as she fulfil her duty as hostess so think the major as he approach she and shake her hand with some well turn compliment upon his lip "let i inthroduce i friend herr von baumser he add mrs. scully smile upon the german in way that win his teutonic heart you will find programme over there she explain think the first be round dance no thank you major shall stand out or there will be no one to receive the people she hurry away to greet party of new arrival while the major and baumser wander off in search of partner there be no want of spirit or of variety in the dancing at morrison 's from mr. snodder the exciseman who dance the original old fashioned trois temp to young bucklebury of the bank who station himself immediately underneath the central chandelier and spin rapidly round with his partner upon his own axis like couple of beetle impale upon single pin every possible variation of the art of waltzing be to be observe there be mr. smith of the medical college rotate round with miss clara timms their face wear that pained and anxious expression which the british countenance naturally assume when dance give the impression that the leg have suddenly burst forth in festive mood and have drag the rest of the body into it very much against its will there be the major too who have succeed in obtain mrs. scully as partner and be dance as old soldier can dance thread his way through the crowded room with the ease begotten by the experience of lifetime meanwhile von baumser at the other end be flounder about with broad smile upon his face and an elderly lady tuck under his right arm while he hold her disengaged hand straight out at right angle as if she have be banjo in short the fun be fast and furious and waltz follow polka and mazurka follow waltz with rapidity which weed out the weak vessel among the dancer and test the stamina of the musician then there be the card room whither the widow scully and the major and many other of the elder repair when they find the pace too fast for they very snug and comfortable it be with its square table each with fringe of chair and the clean shine card spread out over their green baize surface the major and his hostess play against captain livingstone tuck and an old gentleman who come from lambeth with the result that the gallant captain and his partner rise up poor and sad man which be rather blow to the former who reckon upon clear little on such occasion and have not expect to find himself oppose by such past master of the art as the major then the veteran and another play the hostess and another lady and the cunning old dog manage to lose in such natural manner and to pay up with such good grace and with so many pretty speech and compliment that the widow 's partner be visibly impressed fact which curiously enough seem to be anything but agreeable to the widow after that they all file off to supper where they find the dancer already in possession and there be much crush and crowding which tend to do away with ceremony and to promote the harmony of the evening if the major have contrive to win favour from mrs. lavinia scully in the early part of the evening he manage now to increase any advantage he have gain in the first place he inquire in very loud voice of captain tuck at the other end of the table whether that gentleman have ever meet the deceased major general scully and be answer in the negative he descant fluently upon the merit of that imaginary warrior after this unscrupulous manoeuvre the major proceed to do justice to the wine and to indulge in sporting reminiscence and military reminiscence and travel reminiscence and social reminiscence all of which he treat in manner which call forth the admiration of his audience then when supper have at last be finish and the last cork draw and the last glass fill the dancer go back to their dance and the card player to their card and the major address himself more assiduously than ever to the pursuit of the widow "i be afraid that you find the room very hot major she remark "they be rather hot he answer candidly "there be room here she say where you might be cool you might have cigarette too mean these room as smoking room ""then you must come too ""no no major you must remember that be the hostess ""but there be no one to entertain they be all entertain each other you be too unselfish ""but really major sure you be tired out and need little rest "he hold the door open so persuasively that she yield it be snug little room somewhat retire from the bustle with two or three chintz cover chair scatter round it and sofa of the same material at one side the widow sit down at one end of this sofa and the major perch himself at the other look even red than usual and puff out his chest and frowning as be his custom upon critical occasion "do light cigarette say mrs. scully "but the smell?""i like it "the major extract one from his flat silver case his companion roll spill and light it at the gas "to one who be

know how rash have be to treasure they for if they fail i shall feel i loneliness as niver do before "the major pause and clear his throat huskily while the widow remain silent with her head bent and her eye intent upon the pattern of the carpet "these hope be say the major in low voice lean forward and take his companion 's little ring cover hand in his thick pudgy finger that you will have pity upon i that you will ach my very goot vriend cry von baumser heartily suddenly protrude his hairy head into the room and smile benignantly "go to the divil roar the major spring furiously to his foot
