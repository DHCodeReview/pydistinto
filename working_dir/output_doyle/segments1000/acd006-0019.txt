the african merchant be capable of this what might he not be capable of be his word to be depend on under any circumstance and what sort of firm must this be which turn so fair side to the world and in which he have embark his fortune all these thought flash through his mind as he listen to the gossip of the garrulous old sea dog great shock still however be in store for he von baumser have be listen to the conversation with an amused look upon his good humour face ah say he suddenly strike in vill tell you something of your own firm which perhaps you do not know have you hear dat mr. ezra girdlestone be about to be married?""to be married!""oh yes have hear it di morning at eckermann 's office think it be the talk of the city ""who be the gal miggs ask with languid interest "i

it ai n't what you call straight up an down ""it 's transcendental say the mate severely that be what call it ""ah my vriend the german put in when man be in love you must make excuse for he be very sure dat he do mean no offence "in spite of this assurance captain hamilton miggs continue to be very sore upon the point it be only by dint of many replenishing of his glass and many argument that his companion could restore he to his pristine good humour meanwhile the truant be speed through the night with fix determination in his heart that he should have before morning such an understanding one way or the other as would never again leave room for doubt his father 's encouraging word have give ezra girdlestone fresh heart and he have renew his importunity with great energy than ever never surely do any man devote every moment of his time more completely to the winning of woman 's heart from morning until night the one idea be ever before his mind and every little want of kate 's be forestall with care and foresight which astonish she the rich fruit and flower find their way unexpectedly into her room her table be litter with the late book from mudie 's and the new piece lie upon her music stand nothing which attention and thoughtfulness could do be leave undo either by the father or the son in spite of these attention however and the frequent solicitation of her guardian kate stand firmly to her colour if the tom of the present be false she at least would be true to the memory of the tom of other day the lad who have first whisper word of love into her ear her ideal should remain with she whatever might befall no other man could ever take the place of that that tom be from some unexplained and unaccountable reason false to she appear to be beyond all question her trusting and innocent heart could not dream of the subtle network which be be wind round she her seclude life have leave she very ignorant of the way of the world and the possibility of an elaborate deceit be practise upon she have never occur to she from the day that she hear the extract of the letter read by her guardian she never doubt but that such letter be receive at the office by the man who profess to love she how could she hesitate to believe it when it be confirm by his avoidance of eccleston square and of herself the cause of it all be mystery which no amount of speculation could clear up sometimes the poor girl would blame herself as be the way of woman in such case have not see enough of the world she would say to herself have none of the charm of these woman whom read of in the novel no doubt seem dull and insipid in his eye and yet and yet there always remain at the end of her cogitation the same vague sense of bewilderment and mystery she endeavour as far as possible to avoid ezra girdlestone and stay in her room for the most part on the day when he be at home he have however on the advice of his father cease press his suit except in the silent manner aforementione so that she gradually take courage and end by resume her old habit in her heart she pity the young merchant very sincerely for he be look haggard and pale poor fellow she think as she watch he he certainly love i ah tom tom have you only be as constant how happy we should be she be even prompt sometimes to cheer ezra up by some kind word or look this he naturally take to be an encouragement to renew his advance perhaps he be not far wrong for if love be want pity be occasionally an excellent substitute one morning after breakfast the eld girdlestone call his son aside into the library 've have notice he say as to pay up dividend our time be short ezra you must bring matter to head if you do n't it will be too late ""you must n't pick fruit before it be ripe the other answer moodily "you can try if it be ripe though if not you can try again think that your chance be good one she be alone in the breakfast room and the table have be clear you can not have well opening go my son and may heaven prosper you!""very well do you wait in here and shall let you know how thing go "the young man button up his coat pull down his cuff and walk back into the breakfast room with sullen look of resolution upon his dark face kate be sit in wicker chair by the window arrange flower in vase the morning sunlight stream in upon she give colour to her pale face and glitter in her heavy coil of chestnut hair she wear light pink morning dress which add to the ethereal effect of her lithe beautiful figure as ezra enter she look round and start at sight of his face instinctively she know on what errand he have come "you will be late at fenchurch street she say with constrained smile it be nearly eleven now ""i be not go to the office to day he answer gravely be come in here kate to know my fate you know very well and must have know for some time back that love you if you 'll marry i you 'll make i happy man and 'll make you happy woman be not very eloquent and that sort of thing but what say mean what have you to say in answer he lean his broad hand on the back of chair as he speak and drum nervously with his finger kate have droop her head over the flower but she look up at he now with frank pity eye "put this idea out of your head ezra she say in low but firm voice believe i shall always be grateful to you for the kindness which you have show i of late will be sister to you if you will let i but can never be more ""and why not ask ezra still lean over the chair with an angry light begin to sparkle in his dark eye why can you never be my wife?""it be so ezra you must not think of it be so sorry to grieve you ""you ca n't love i then cry the young merchant hoarsely "other woman before now would have give their eye to have have i do you know that?""for goodness sake then go back to the other say kate half amused and half angry that suspicion of smile upon her face be the one thing need to setezra 's temper in blaze you wo n't have i he cry savagely "i have n't get the air and grace of that fellow suppose you have n't get he out of your head though he be off with anothergirl ""how dare you speak to i so kate cry spring to her foot in honest anger "it be the truth and you know it return ezra with sneer be n't you too proud to be hang on to man who do n't want you man that be smooth tongue sneak with the heart of rabbit?""if he be here you would not dare to say so kate retort hotly "wouldn't he snarl fiercely "no you would n't do n't believe that he have ever be untrue to i believe that you and your father have plan to make i believe it and to keep we apart "heaven know what it be that suddenly bring this idea most clearly before kate 's mind perhaps it be that ezra 's face distort with passion give she some dim perception of the wickedness of which such nature might be capable the dark face turn so much dark at her word that she feel great throb of joy at her heart and know that this strange new thought which have flash upon she be the truth "you ca n't deny it
