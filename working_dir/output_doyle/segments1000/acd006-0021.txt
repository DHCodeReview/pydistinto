the merchant pull note book from his pocket and proceed by the light of the lamp above he to add up column of figure he sit very upright in his seat and appear to be as absorb in his work as though he be among his paper in fenchurch street he neither glance at his companion nor make any inquiry as to her comfort as she sit opposite to he she could not keep her eye from his hard angular face every rugged feature of which be exaggerate by the flickering yellow light above he those deep set eye and sink cheek have be familiar to she for year how be it that they now for the first time strike she as be terrible be it that new expression which have appear upon they that hard inexorable set about the mouth which give more sinister character to his whole face as she gaze at he an ineffable loathing and dread rise in her soul and she could have shriek out of pure terror she put her hand up to her throat with gasp to keep down the sudden inclination to cry out as she do so her guardian glance over the top of the note book with his pierce light grey eye "don't get hysterical he cry you have give we trouble enough without that ""oh why be you so harsh she cry throw out her arm towards

rembrandt to depict the craggy strongly line face of the old merchant and the beautiful pleading one which look across at he with the light throw strange shadow over both as he speak she brush the tear from her eye and an angry flush spring to her cheek "you may say what you like of i she say bitterly suppose that be one of your privilege as my guardian you have no right however to speak evil of my friend he who calleth his brother fool think the good old book say something of that "girdlestone be stagger for moment by this unexpected counter then he take off his broad brim hat and bow his

know to be untrue about mr. dimsdale say kate wax more fearless as her mind turn to her wrong "you be become impertinent he answer and resume his calculation in his note book kate cower back into her corner again while the train thunder and screech and rattle through the darkness look through the steamy window nothing be to be see save the twinkle here and there of the light of the scatter country cottage occasionally red signal lamp would glare down upon she like the bloodshot eye of some demon who preside over this kingdom of iron and steam far behind lurid trail of smoke mark the way that they have come to kate 's mind it be all as weird and gloomy and cheerless even as the thought within she and they be gloomy enough where be she go how long be she go for what be she to do when there on all these point she be absolutely ignorant what be the object of this sudden flight from london her guardian could have separate she from the dimsdales in many less elaborate way than this could it be that he intend some system of pressure and terrorism by which she should be force to accept ezra as suitor she clench her little white tooth as she think of it and register vow that nothing in this world would ever bring she to give in upon that point there be only one bright spot in her outlook when she reach her destination she would at once write to mrs. dimsdale tell she where she be and ask she frankly for an explanation of their sudden silence how much wise if she have do so before only foolish pride have withhold she from it the train have already stop at one large junction look out

passenger who alight and the train roll on for portsmouth leave they with their trunk upon the dark and narrow platform it be black night with bitter wind which carry with it suspicion of dampness which might have be rain or might have be the drift of the neighbouring ocean kate be numb with the cold and even her gaunt companion stamp his foot and shiver as he look about he "i telegraph for trap say he to the guard be there not one waiting?""yes sir if you be mister girdlestone there be trap from the flyin'bull here carker here be your gentleman "at this summon rough look ostler emerge into the circle of light throw by the single lamp and touch his hat announce in surly voice that he be the individual in question the guard and he then proceed to drag the trunk to the vehicle it be small wagonette with high seat for the driver in front "where to sir ask the driver when the traveller have take their seat "to hampton priory do you know where that is?""better'n two mile from here and close to the railway line say the man there hain't be no one livin there for two year at the least ""we be expect and all will be ready for we say girdlestone "go as fast as you can for we be cold "the driver crack his whip and the horse start at brisk trot down the dark country road look round she kate see that they be pass through large country village consist of broad main street with few insignificant offshoot branch away on either side church stand on one side and on the other the village inn the door be open and the light shine through the red curtain of the bar parlour look warm and cosy the clink of glass and the murmur of cheerful voice sound from within kate as she look across feel doubly cheerless and lonely by the contrast girdlestone look too but with different emotion "another plague spot he cry jerk his head in that direction in town or country it be the same these poison seller be scatter over the whole face of the land and every one of they be focus of disease and misery ""beg your pardon sir the surly driver observe screw round in his seat that ere be theflyin bull sir where be in sarvice and it ai n't no poison seller but real right down good house ""all

leg mutton hold up will ye!"the last remark be address to the horse which have stumble in go down sharp incline they be out of the village by this time and the road be line on either side by high hedge which throw dense shadow over everything the feeble lamp of the wagonette bore two little yellow tunnel of light on either side the man let the rein lie loose upon the horse 's back and the animal pick out the roadway for itself as they swing round from the narrow lane on to broad road kate break out into little cry of pleasure "there be the sea she exclaim joyfully the moon have break from behind the cloud and glitter on the vast silvery expanse "yes that be the sea the driver say and they light down yonder be at lea claxton where the fisher folk live and over there point with his whip to long dark shadow on the water be the oilywoite ""the what?""the isle of wight he mean say girdlestone the driver look at he reproachfully of course say he if you lunnon folk know more about it than we who be bear an breed in the place it be no manner use our tryin to teach you with this sarcastic comment he withdraw into himself and refuse to utter another word until the end of their journey it be not long before this be attain pass down deeply rut lane they come to high stone wall which extend for couple of hundred yard it have crumbling decay appearance as far as could be judge in the uncertain light this wall be break by single iron gate flank by two high pillar each of which be surmount by some weather beat heraldic device pass through they turn up wind avenue with line of tree on either side which shoot their branch so thickly above they that they might have be drive through some sombre tunnel this avenue terminate in an open space in the midst of which tower great irregular whitewash building which be the old priory all below it be swathe in darkness but the upper window catch the glint of the moon and emit pallid and sickly glimmer the whole effect be so weird and gloomy that kate feel her heart sink within she the wagonette pull up in front of the door and girdlestone assist she to alight there have be no light or any symptom of welcome but as they pull down the trunk the door open and little old woman appear with candle in her hand which she carefully shade from the wind while she peer out into the darkness "is that mr. girdlestone she cry "of course it be the merchant say impatiently do not telegraph and tell you that be coming?""yes yes she answer hobble forward with the light and this be the young lady come in my dear come in we have not get thing very smart yet but they will soon come right "she lead the way through lofty hall into large sitting room which no doubt have be the monkish refectory in bygone day it look very bleak and cold now although small fire sputter and sparkle in the corner of the great iron grate there be pan upon the fire and the deal table in the centre of the room be lay out roughly as for meal the candle which the old woman have carry in be the only light though the flickering fire cast strange fantastic shadow in the further corner and among the great oaken rafter which form the ceiling "come up to the fire my dear say the old woman take off your cloak and warm yourself she hold her own shrivel arm towards the blaze as though her short exposure to the night air have chill she glance at she kate see that her face be sharp feature and cunning with loose low lip which expose line of yellow tooth and chin which bristle with tuft of long grey hair from without there come the crunching of gravel as the wagonette turn and rattle down the avenue kate listen to the sound of the wheel until they die away in the distance they seem somehow to be the last link which bind she to the human race her heart fail she completely and she burst into tear "what be the matter then the old woman ask look up at she "what be ye cry about?""oh be so miserable and so lonely she cry what have do that should be so unhappy why should be take to this horrible horrible place?""what be the matter with the place ask her withered companion "i do n't see nought amiss with it here be mr. girdlestone comin he do n't grumble at the place 'll warr'nt "the merchant be not in the good of temper for he have have an altercation with the driver about the fare and be cold into the bargain at it again he say roughly as he enter it be who ought to weep think who have be put to all this trouble and inconvenience by your disobedience and weakness of mind "kate do not answer but sit upon coarse deal chair beside the fire and bury her face in her hand all manner of vague fear and fancy fill her mind what be tom do now how quickly he would fly to her rescue do he but know how strangely she be situate she determine that her very first action next morning should be to write to mrs. dimsdale and to tell she not only where she be but all that have occur the reflection that she could do this cheer her heart and she manage to eat little of the supper which the old woman have now place upon the table it be rough stew of some sort but the long journey have give an edge to their appetite and the merchant though usually epicurean in his taste eat hearty meal when supper be over the crone who be address by girdlestone as jorrocks lead the way upstairs and show kate to her room if the furniture of the dining room have be spartan in its simplicity this be even more so for there be nothing in it save small iron bedstead much rust from want of use and high wooden box on which stand the simple toilet requisite in spite of the poverty of the apartment kate have never be more glad to enter her luxurious chamber at home the little carpetless room be haven of rest where she would be leave for one night at least to her own thought as she lie in bed however she could hear far away the subdued murmur of girdlestone 's voice and the shrill tone of the old woman they be in deep and animate converse though they be too far distant for she to distinguish word something tell she that their talk be about herself and the same instinct assure she that it bode she little good when she awake in the morning it be some little time before she could realize where she be or recall the event which have make such sudden change in her life the bare cold room with the whitewash wall and the narrow bed upon which she lie bring back to she the recollection of hospital ward which she have see in edinburgh and her first thought be that she have have some accident and have be convey to some such establishment the delusion be only momentary however for her true situation come back to she at once with all its vague horror of the two she would have prefer that her first impression have be correct the small window of her apartment be cover by dirty muslin blind she rise and draw it aside look eagerly out from what she have see the night before she have hope that this prison to which she have be convey might make amend for its loneliness by some degree of natural beauty the scene which now meet her eye soon dispel any expectation of the sort the avenue with its tree lie on the other side of the house from her window nothing be visible but dreary expanse of bog land and mudbank stretch down to the sea at high tide this enormous waste of dreariness and filth be cover by the water but at present it lie before she in all its naked hideousness the very type of dullness and desolation here and there few scatter reed or an unhealthy greenish scum upon the mud give touch of colour to the scene but for the most part the great plain be all of the same sombre mud tint with its monotony break only by the white fleck where the swarm of gull and kittiwake have settle in the hope of pick up whatever have be leave by the recede tide away across the broad surface line of sparkle foam mark the fringe of the ocean which stretch away to the horizon mile or two to the eastward of her kate see some sign of house and blue smoke which flicker up into the air this she guess to be the fishing village of lea claxton which the driver have mention the night before she feel as she gaze at the little hamlet and the mast of the boat in front of it that she be not alone in the world and that even in this strange and desolate place there be honest heart to whom as last resource she could appeal she be still stand at the window when there come knocking at the door and she hear the voice of the old woman ask if she be awake breakfast be ready she say and the master be wonder why you bean't down "on this summon kate hasten her toilet and make her way down the old winding stair to the room in which they have sup the night before surely girdlestone must have have heart of flint not to be melt by the sight of that fair fresh face his feature set as hard as adamant as she enter the room and he look at she with eye which be pucker and angry "you be late he say coldly you must remember that you be not ineccleston square an idle soul shall suffer hunger say the prophet you be here to be discipline and discipline you shall be ""i be sorry she answer think that must have be tired by our journey "the vast room look even more comfortless and bleak than on the precede evening on the table be plate of ham and egg john girdlestone serve out portion and push it in her direction she sit down on one of the rough wooden chair and eat listlessly wonder how all this be go to end after breakfast girdlestone order the old woman out of the room and stand in front of the fire with his long leg apart and his hand behind his back he tell she in harsh concise language what his intention be "i have long determine he say that if you run counter to my wish and persist in your infatuated affection for that scapegrace should remove you to some secluded spot where you might reconsider your conduct and form well resolution for the future this country house answer the purpose admirably and as an old servant of mine mrs. jorrocks chance to reside in the neighbourhood have warn she that at any time might come down and should expect to find thing ready your rash and heartless conduct have however precipitate matter and we have arrive before her preparation be complete our future arrangement will therefore be less primitive than they be at present here you shall remain young lady until you show sign of repentance and of willingness to undo the harm which you have do ""if you mean until consent to marry your son then shall live and die here the girl say bravely "that rest with yourself as say before you be under discipline here and you may not find existence such bed of rose as it be in eccleston square ""can have my maid kate ask can hardly stay here with no one but the old woman in the house ""rebecca be come down have telegram from ezra to that effect and he will himself join we for day or two in each week ""ezra here kate cry in horror her chief consolation through all her trouble have be that there seem to be some chance of getting rid of her terrible suitor "and why not the old man ask angrily be you so bitter against the lad as to grudge he the society of his own father?"kate be save from further reproach by the entrance of the old woman to clear the table the last item of intelligence however have give she terrible shock and at the same time have fill she with astonishment what could the fast live comfort seek man about town want in this dreary abode she know ezra well and be sure that he be not man to alter his way of life or suffer discomfort of any kind without some very definite object it seem to she that this be new mesh in the net which be be draw round she when her guardian have leave the room kate ask mrs. jorrocks for sheet of paper the crone shake her head and wag her pendulous lip in derision "mister girdlestone think as you would be after that she say "there ai n't no paper here nor pen neither nor ink neither ""what none dear mrs. jorrocks do have pity on i and get i sheet however old and soil see here be some silver you be very welcome to it if you will give i the material for write one letter "mrs jorrock look longingly with her blear eye at the few shilling which the girl hold out to she but she shake her head dursn't do it she say it be as much as my place be worth ""then shall walk down to bedsworth myself say kate angrily have no doubt that the people in the post office will let i sit there and write it "the old hag laugh hoarsely to herself until the scraggy sinew of her withered neck stand out like whipcord she be still chuckle and cough when the merchant come back into the room "what then he ask sternly look from one to the other he be himself constitutionally averse to merriment and he be irritated by it in other why be you laugh mrs. jorrocks?""i be laugh at she the woman wheeze point with tremulous finger she be askin i for paper and sayin as she would go and write letter at the bedsworth post office ""you must understand once for all girdlestone roar turn savagely upon the girl that you be cut off entirely from the outer world shall give you no loophole which you may utilize to continue your intimacy with undesirable people have give order that you should not be provide with either paper or ink "poor kate 's last hope seem to be fade away her heart sink within she but she keep brave face for she do not wish he to see how his word have stricken she she have desperate plan in her head which would be more likely to be successful could she but put he off his guard she spend the morning in her own little room she have be provide with ponderous brown bible out of which the fly leave have be carefully cut and this she read though her thought often wander away from the sacred page about one o'clock she hear the clatter of hoofs and the sound of wheel on the drive go down she find that it be cart which have come from bedsworth with furniture there be carpet chest of drawer table and several other article which the driver proceed to carry upstairs help by john girdlestone the old woman be in the upper room it seem to kate that she might never again have such an opportunity of carry out the resolve which she have form she put on her bonnet and begin to stroll listlessly about in front of the door pick few straggling leave from the neglect lawn gradually she saunter away in this manner to the head of the avenue and then take one swift timid glance around she slip in among the tree and make the good of her way half walk half run down the dark winding drive oh the joy of the moment when the great white house which have already become so hateful to she be obscure among the tree behind she she have some idea of the road which she have traverse the night before behind she be all her trouble in front the avenue gate bedsworth and freedom she would send both telegram and letter to dr. dimsdale and explain to he her exact
