up the lane with tin can in her hand lonely and forlorn but not yet quite destitute of hope she turn to the right among the tree and push her way through bush and bramble to the boundary of the priory ground it be lofty wall at least nine foot in height with coping which bristle with jagged piece of glass kate walk along the base of it her fair skin all tear and bleed with scratch from the briar until she satisfy herself that there be no break in it there be one small wooden door on the side which be skirt by the railway line but it be lock and impassable the only opening through which human being could pass be that which be guard in the manner she have see the sicken conviction take possession of her mind that without wing it be an utter impossibility either to get away or to give the least information to any one in the world as to where she be or what might befall she when she come back to the house tired and dishevel after her journey of exploration girdlestone be stand by the door to receive she with sardonic smile upon his thin lip how do you like the ground then he ask with the near approach to hilarity which she have ever hear from he and the ornamental fencing and the lodge keeper how do you like they all?"kate try for moment to make some brave retort but it be useless attempt her lip tremble her eye fill and with cry of grief and despair which might have move wild beast she flee to her room and throw herself upon her bed burst into such scald bitter tear as few woman be ever call upon to shed that same evening rebecca come down from london her presence be comfort to kate for though she have never like or trust the girl yet the mere fact of have some one of her own age near she give she sense of security and of companionship her room too have be alter for the well and the maid be give the one next door so that by knock on the wall she could always communicate with she this be an unspeakable consolation for at night the old house be so full of the sudden cracking of warped timber and the scampering of rat that entire loneliness be unendurable apart from these uncanny sound there be other circumstance which give the priory sinister reputation the very aspect of the building be enough to suggest weird impression its high white wall be blotch with patch of mildew and in some part there be long greenish stain from roof to ground like tear streak on the crumble plaster indoor there be dank graveyard smell in the low corridor and narrow stair case floor and ceiling be equally worm eaten and rotten broad flake of plaster from the wall lie litter about in the passage the wind too penetrate the building through many crack and cranny so that there be constant sighing and soughing in the big dreary room which have most eerie and melancholy effect kate soon learn however that besides these vague terror all predispose the mind to alarm and exciting the imagination there be general belief that another more definite cause for fear exist in the old monastery with cruel minuteness of detail her guardian have tell she the legend which haunt those gloomy corridor it appear that in olden time the priory have be inhabit by dominicans and that in the course of year these monk have fall away from their original state of sanctity they preserve name for piety among the country folk by their austere demeanour but in secret within the wall of their own monastery they practise every sort of dissipation and crime while the community be in this state of demoralization each from the abbot downward vie with the other in the number and enormity of their sin there come pious minded youth from neighbouring village who beg that he might be permit to join the order he have be attract he say by the fame of their sanctity he be receive amongst they and at first be not admit to their revel but gradually as his conscience be suppose to become more hardened he be duly initiate into all their mystery horrify by what he see the good youth conceal his indignation until he have master all the abomination of the establishment and then rise up on the altar step he denounce they in fiery scathing word he would leave they that night he say and he would tell his experience through the length and breadth of the country incense and alarm the friar hold hasty meeting and then seize the young novice they drag he down the cellar step and lock he up there this same cellar have long be celebrate for the size and ferocity of the rat which inhabit it which be so fierce and strong that even during the day they have be know to attack those who enter it be say that long into the weary hour of the night the fearful shriek and terrible struggle of the captive as he fight with his innumerable assailant resound through the long corridor "they do say that he walk about the house at time girdlestone say in conclusion no one have ever be find who would live here very long since then but of course such strong minded young woman as you who can not even obey your own guardian would never be frighten by such childish idea as that ""i do not believe in ghost and do n't think shall be frightened kate answer but for all that the horrible story stick in her mind and add another to the many terror which surround she mr. girdlestone 's room be immediately above hers on the second day of her imprisonment she go up on to this landing for have nothing to read save the bible and no material for writing she have little to do but to wander over the old house and through the ground the door of girdlestone 's room be ajar and she could not help observe as she pass that the apartment be most elegantly and comfortably furnished so be the next room the door of which be also open the solid furniture and rich carpet contrast strangely with her own bare whitewash chamber all this point to the fact that her removal to the priory have not be sudden impulse on the part of the old merchant but that he have plan and arrange every detail beforehand her refusal of ezra be only the excuse for set the machinery in motion what be the object then and what be to be the end of this subtle scheming that be the question which occur to she every hour of the day and every hour the answer seem more grim and menacing there be one link in the chain which be ever hide from she it have never occur to the girl that her fortune could be of moment to the firm she have be so accustomed to hear ezra and his father talk glibly of million that she depreciate her own little capital and fail to realize how important it might be in commercial crisis indeed the possibility of such crisis never enter her head for one of her early impression be hear her father talk of the great resource of the firm and of its stability that this firm be now in the dire strait and that her money be absolutely essential to its existence be thing which never for one instant enter her thought yet that necessity be become more pressing every day ezra in london be do all that indomitable energy and extraordinary business capacity could do to prolong the struggle as debt become due he would still stave off each creditor with such skill and plausibility as allay every suspicion day by day however the work become more severe and he feel that he be prop up an edifice which be so rotten that it must soon or later come crumble about his ear when he come down to the priory upon the saturday the young man 's haggard and anxious face show the severe ordeal which he have undergo kate have already retire to her room when he arrive she hear the sound of the trap however and guess who it be even before his deep bass voice sound in the room beneath look out of her window little later she see he walk to and fro in the moonlight talk earnestly to his father it be bitter night and she wonder what they could have to talk about which might not be say beside the warm fire in the dining room they flicker up and down among the shadow for more than an hour and then the girl hear the door slam and shortly afterwards the heavy tread of the two man pass her chamber and ascend to the room above it be momentous conversation which she have witness in it ezra have show his father how impossible it be to keep up appearance and how infallible be their ruin unless help come speedily "i do n't think any of they smell rat he say mortimer and johnson press for their bill in rather an ugly manner but talk they over completely take out my cheque book look here gentleman say if you wish shall write cheque for the amount if do it will be the last piece of business which

that it be his opinion that people be be continually make away with and that not more than one in ten be ever account for nine chance to one ezra and then those which be find out be very vulgar affair

before have obtrude unpleasantly on his dream kate slip away from they as soon as she could and put on her bonnet go for long walk through the ground partly for the sake of exercise and partly in the hope of find some egress the one eyed gate keeper be at his post and set up hideous shout of laughter when he see she so she branch off among the tree to avoid he and walk once more very carefully round the boundary wall it be no easy matter to follow it continuously for the briar and bramble grow in confused tangle up to its very base by perseverance however she succeed in trace every foot of it and so satisfy herself finally that there be no diminution anywhere in its height no break in its continuity save the one small wooden door which be securely fasten there be one spot however where gleam of hope present itself at an angle of the wall there stand deserted wooden shed which have be use for the protection of gardener tool in the day when the ground have be keep in well order it be not buttress up against the wall but stand some eight or ten foot from it beside the shed be an empty barrel which have once be water butt the girl manage to climb to the top of the barrel and from this she be easily able to gain the sloping roof of the shed up this she clamber until she stand upon the summit considerable height above the ground from it she be able to look down over the wall on to the country road and the railway line which lie on the other side of it true that an impassable chasm lie between she and the wall but it would be surely possible for she to hail passer
