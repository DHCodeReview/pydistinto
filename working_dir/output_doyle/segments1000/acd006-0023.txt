wicked action there be power which will judge between we some day and will exact atonement for your broken oath to your dead friend and for your cruel treatment of one who be leave to your care she speak with burn cheek and with such fearless energy that the hard city man fairly cower away from she "we will leave that to the future he say come up to do you kindness and you abuse i hear that there be insect about the house beetle and the like few drop from this bottle scatter about the room would keep they away take care for it be violent though painless poison if take by human being he hand she phial with brownish turbid liquid in it and large red poison label which she take without comment and place upon the mantelpiece girdlestone give quick keen glance at she as he retire in truth he be astonish at the alteration which the last few day have make in her appearance her cheek be colourless and sunken save for the single hectic spot which announce the fever within her eye be unnaturally bright strange and new expression have settle upon her whole countenance it seem to girdlestone that there be every chance that his story might become reality and her reason be permanently derange she have however more vitality than her guardian give her credit for indeed at the very time when he set she down in his mind as broken woman she have form fresh plan for escape which it would require both energy and determination to put into execution during the last few day she have endeavour to make friend with the maid rebecca but the invincible aversion which the latter have entertain for she ever since ezra have visit she with his unwelcome attention be not to be overcome by any advance which she could make she perform her office with heart full of malice and an eye which triumph in her mistress 's misfortune kate have bethink herself that stevens the gatekeeper only mount guard during the day she have observe too at the time of her conversation with he that the iron gate be in such state of disrepair that even if it be lock it would not be difficult matter to scramble through or over it if she could only gain the open air during the night there would be nothing to prevent she from make she way to bedsworth whence she could travel on to portsmouth which be only seven mile away surely there she would find some charitable people who would communicate with her friend and give she temporary shelter the front door of the house be lock every night but there be nail behind it on which she hope to find the key there be another door at the back then there be the window of the ground floor which might be try in case the door be too securely fasten if only she could avoid wake any one there be no reason why she should not succeed if the bad come to the bad and she be detect they could not treat she more cruelly than they have already do ezra have go back to london so that she have only three enemy to contend against girdlestone rebecca and old mrs. jorrocks of these girdlestone sleep upon the floor above and mrs. jorrocks who might have be the most dangerous of all as her room be on the ground floor be fortunately so deaf that there be little risk of disturb she the problem resolve itself therefore into be able to pass rebecca 's room without arouse she and as she know the maid to be sound sleeper there seem to be every chance of success she sit at her window all that afternoon steel her mind to the ordeal before she she be weak poor girl and shake little fit for anything which require courage and resolution her mind run much upon her father and upon the mother whom she have never know but whose miniature be among her most precious treasure the thought of they help to dispel the dreadful feeling of utter loneliness which be the most unendurable of all her trouble it be cold bright day and the tide be in cover the mudbank and lap up against the wall of the priory ground so clear be it that she could distinguish the house at the east end of the isle of wight when she open her window and look out she could perceive that the sea upon her right form great inlet dreary and dry at low tide but look now like broad reed girt lake this be langston harbour and far away at its mouth she could make out clump of building which mark the watering place of hayling there be other sign however of the presence of man from her window she could see the great man of war steaming up the channel to and from the anchorage at spithead some be low in the water and venomous looking with bulbous turret and tiny mast other be long and stately with great lower hulk and broad expanse of canvas occasionally foreign service gunboat would pass white and ghostly like some tired seabird flap its way home it be one of kate 's few amusement to watch the passing and repasse of the vessel and to speculate upon whence they have come and whither they be bind on that eventful evening rebecca go to bed rather early than usual kate retire to her room and having make her final preparation and stuff she few article of jewelry into her pocket to serve in place of money she lie down upon her bed and tremble at the thought of what be in front of she down below she could hear her guardian 's shuffling step as he move about the refectory then come the creaking of the rusty lock as he secure the door and shortly afterwards he pass upstairs to his room mrs. jorrocks have also go to bed and all be quiet in the house kate know that some hour must elapse before she could venture to make the attempt she remember to have read in some book that the sleep of human being be usually deep about two in the morning so she have choose that hour for her enterprise she have put on her strong dress and her thick shoe but have muffle the latter in cloth so that they should make no sound no precaution which she could think of have be neglect there be now nothing to be do but to spend the time as well she might until the hour of action should arrive she rise and look out of the window again the tide be out now and the moon glitter upon the distant ocean mist be creep up however and even as she look it draw its veil over the water it be bitterly cold she shiver and her tooth begin to chatter stretch herself upon the bed once more she wrap the blanket round she and wear out with anxiety and fatigue drop into troubled sleep she slumber some hour before she awake look at her watch she find that it be after two she must not delay any long with the little bundle of her more valuable possession in her hand she give such gasp as diver give before he make his spring and slip past rebecca 's half open door she feel her way down the wooden stair pick her step very carefully even in the daytime she have often notice how those old plank creak and crack beneath her weight now in the dead silence of the night they emit such sound that her heart sink within she she stop several time convince that she must be discover but all be hush and still it be relief when at last she reach the ground floor and be able to feel her way along the passage to the door shake in every limb from cold and fear she put her hand to the lock the key be not there she try the nail there be nothing there her wary gaoler have evidently carry it away with he to his room would it occur to he to do the same in the case of the back door it be very possible that he might have overlook it she retrace her step down the passage pass mrs. jorrocks room where the old woman be snore peacefully and begin to make her way as well she could through the great ramble building run along the basement floor from front to back there be long corridor one side of which be pierce for window at the end of this corridor be the door which she wish to reach the moon have break through the fog and pour its light through each opening cast succession of silvery flicker spot upon the floor between each of these bar of uncertain light be an interval of darkness kate stand at the head of this corridor with her hand against the wall awe by the sudden sight of the moonlight and by the weird effect which be produce by the alternate patch of shadow and brightness as she stand there suddenly with eye distend with horror she become aware that something be approach she down the corridor she see it move as dark formless mass at the further end it pass through the bar of light vanish appear once more lose itself in the darkness emerge again it be half way down the passage and still come on petrify with terror she could only wait and watch nearer it come and near it be glide into the last bar of light immediately in front of she it be on she god of mercy it be dominican friar the moon shine clear and cold upon his gaunt figure and his sombre robe the poor girl throw up her hand give one terrible scream of horror which ring through the old house and sink senseless to the ground it would be impossible to describe the suspense in which tom dimsdale live during these week in vain he try in every manner to find some way of trace the fugitive he wander aimlessly about london from one inquiry office to another tell his story and appeal for assistance he advertise in paper and cross question every one who might know anything of the matter there be none however who could help he or throw any light upon the mystery no one at the office know anything of the movement of the senior partner to all inquiry ezra reply that he have be order by the doctor to seek complete repose in the country dimsdale dog ezra 's footstep night after night in the hope of gain some clue but in vain on the saturday he follow he to the railway station but ezra as we have see succeed in give he the slip his father become seriously anxious about the young fellow 's health he eat nothing and his sleep be much broken both the old people try to inculcate patience and moderation "that fellow ezra girdlestone know where they be tom would cry stride wildly up and down the room with unkempt hair and clench hand will have his secret if have to tear it out of he ""steady lad steady the doctor reply to one of these outburst there be nothing to be gain by violence they be on the right side of the law at present and you will be on the wrong if you do anything rash the girl could have write if she be uncomfortable ""ah so she could she must have forget we how could she after all that have passed!""let we hope for the good let we hope for the good the doctor would say soothingly yet it must be confess that he be considerably stagger by the turn which thing have take he have see so much of the world in his professional capacity that he have become very reliable judge of character all his instinct tell he that kate harston be true hearted and well principle girl it be not in her nature to leave london and never to send single line to her friend to tell they where or why she have go there must he be sure be some good reason for her silence and this reason resolve itself into one or two thing either she be ill and unable to hold pen or she have lose her freedom and be restrain from write to they the last supposition seem to the doctor to be the more serious of the two have he know the instability of the girdlestone firm and the necessity they be under of get ready money he would at once have hold the key to the enigma he have no idea of that but in spite of his ignorance he be deeply distrustful of both father and son he know and have often deplore the clause in john harston 's will by which the ward 's money revert to the guardian forty thousand pound be bait which might tempt even wealthy man into crooked path it be saturday the third saturday since girdlestone and his ward have disappear dimsdale have fully make up his mind that go where he would ezra should not escape he this time on two consecutive saturdays the young merchant have manage to get away from he and have be absent each time until the monday morning tom know and the thought be bitter one that these day be spend in some unknown retreat in the company of kate and of her guardian this time at least he should not get away without reveal his destination the two young man remain in the office until two o'clock then ezra put on his hat and overcoat button it up close for the weather be bitterly cold tom at once pick up his wide awake and follow he out into fenchurch street so close to his heel that the swinge door have not shut on the one before the other pass through ezra glance round at he when he hear the footstep and give snarl like an angry dog there be no long any pretence of civility between the two and whenever their eye meet it be only to exchange glance of hatred and defiance hansom be pass down the street and ezra with few muttered word to the driver spring in fortunately another have just discharge its fare and be still wait by the curb tom run up to it keep that red cab in sight he say whatever you do do n't let it get away from you the driver who be man of few word nod and whip up his horse it chance that this same horse be either fast or fresher one than that which bear the young merchant the red cab rattle down fleet street then double on its track and come back by st. paul 's plunge into labyrinth of side street from which it eventually emerge upon the thames embankment in spite of all its effort however it be unable to shake off its pursuer the red cab journey on down the embankment and across one of the bridge tom 's able charioteer still keep only few yard behind it among the narrow street on the surrey side ezra 's vehicle pull up at low beer shop tom 's drive on hundred yard or so and then stop where he could have good view of whatever occur ezra have jump out and enter the public house tom wait patiently outside until he should reappear his movement hitherto have puzzle he completely for moment the wild hope come into his head that kate might be conceal in this strange hiding place but little reflection show he the absurdity and impossibility of the idea he have not long to wait in very few minute young girdlestone come out again accompany by tall burly man with bushy red beard who be miserably dressed and appear to be somewhat the bad for drink he be help into the cab by ezra and the pair drive off together tom be more bewildered than ever who be this fellow and what connexion have he with the matter on hand like sleuth hound the pursue hansom thread its way through the torrent of vehicle which pour down the london street never for one moment lose sight of its quarry presently they wheel into the waterloo road close to the waterloo station the red cab turn sharp round and rattle up the incline which lead to the main line tom spring out toss sovereign to the driver and follow on foot at the top of his speed as he run into the station ezra girdlestone and the red bearded stranger be immediately in front of he there be great swarm of people all around for as it be saturday there be special train to the country tom be afraid of lose sight of the two man in the crowd so he elbow his way through as quickly as he could and get immediately behind they so close that he could have touch they with his hand they be approach the booking office when ezra glance round and see his rival stand behind he he give bitter curse and whisper something to his half drunken companion the latter turn and with an inarticulate cry like wild beast rush at the young man and seize he by the throat with his brawny hand it be one thing however to catch man by the throat and another to retain that grip especially when your antagonist happen to be an international football player to tom this red bearded rough who charge he so furiously be nothing more than the thousand of bull headed forwards who have come upon he like thunder bolt in the day of old with the ease beget by practice he circle his assailant with his long muscular arm and give quick convulsive jerk in which every sinew of his body participate the red bearded man 's stumpy leg describe half circle in the air and he come down on the stone pavement with sound crash which shake every particle of breath from his enormous body tom 's fight blood be all aflame now and his grey eye glitter with berserk joy as he make at ezra all the caution of his father and the exhortation of his mother be cast to the wind as he see his enemy stand before he to do he justice ezra be nothing loth but spring forward to meet he hit with both hand they be well match for both be train boxer and exceptionally powerful man ezra be perhaps the strong but tom be in well condition there be short eager rally blow and guard and counter so quick and hard that the eye could hardly follow it then rush of railway servant and bystander tear they asunder tom have red flush on his forehead where blow have fall ezra be spit out the fragment of broken tooth and bleed profusely each struggle furiously to get at the other with the result that they be drag far apart eventually burly policeman seize tom by the collar and hold he as in vice "where be he tom cry crane his neck to catch glimpse of his enemy he 'll get away after all ""can't elp that say the guardian of the peace phlegmatically gen'elman like you ought to be ashamed keep quiet now would yer then this last at some specially energetic effort on the part of the prisoner to recover his freedom "they'll get away know they will tom cry in despair for both ezra and his companion who be none other than burt of african notoriety have disappear from his sight his fear prove to be only too well found for when at last he succeed in wrest himself from the constable 's clutch he could find no trace of his enemy dozen bystander give dozen different account of their movement he rush from one platform to another over all the great station he could have tear his hair at the thought of the way in which he have allow they to slip through his finger it be fully an hour before he finally abandon the search and acknowledge to himself that he have be hoodwink for the third time and that long week would elapse before he could have another chance of solve the mystery he turn at last sadly and reluctantly away from the station and walk across to waterloo bridge brood over all that have occur and curse himself for his stupidity in allow himself to be draw into vulgar brawl when he might have attain his end so much well by quiet observation it be some consolation however that he have have one fair crack at ezra girdlestone he glance down at his knuckle which be raw and bleed with mixture of satisfaction and disgust with half smile he put his injured hand in his pocket and look up once more become aware that red face gentleman be approach he in highly excited manner it could not be say that the red face gentleman walk neither could it be say that the red face gentleman run his mode of progression might well be describe as succession of short and unwieldy jump which as he be rather stout gentleman appear to indicate some very urgent and press need for hurry his face be bathe in perspiration and his collar have become flaccid and shapeless from the same cause it appear to tom as he gaze at those rubicund though anxious feature that they should be well known to he that glossy hat those speckless gaiter and the long frock coat surely they could belong to none other than the gallant major tobias clutterbuck late of her majesty 's 119th of the line?as the old soldier approach tom he quicken his pace so that when he eventually come up with he he could only puff and pant and hold out soiled letter "read he manage to ejaculate tom open the letter and glance his eye over the content with face which have turn as pale as the major 's be red when he finish it he turn without word and begin to run in the direction from which he have come the major follow as quickly as his breath would permit when kate come to herself after the terrible incident which frustrate her attempt at escape she find herself in bed in her own little room by the light which shine in through the window she know that it must be well on in the day her head be throb violently and she be so weak that she could hardly raise herself in bed when she look round she find that rebecca have bring chair in from her room and be sit by the fire at the sound of her movement the maid glance up and perceive that her mistress have recover consciousness "lor bless i she cry you 've give we pretty fright we think you be n't come back to your sense no more you 've be lyin there since the middle
