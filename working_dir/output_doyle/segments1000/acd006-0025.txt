his great reputation no one would ever dream that such consideration could have weight with he having send the telegram off and so take final step john girdlestone feel more at his ease he be proud of his own energy and decision as he walk very pompously and gravely down the village street his heart glow within he at the thought of the long struggle which he have maintain against misfortune he pass over in his mind all the successive borrowing and speculation and makeshift and ruse which the firm have resort to yet in spite of every danger and difficulty it still hold up its head with the good and would weather the storm at last he reflect proudly that there be no other man in the city who would have have the dog tenacity and the grim resolution which he have display during the last twelve month if ever any one should put it all in book he say to himself there be few who would believe it possible it be not by my own strength that have do it "the man have no consciousness of blasphemy in he as he revolve this thought in his mind he be as thoroughly in earnest as be any of those religious fanatic who throughout history have burn sack and destroy commit every sin under heaven in the name of god of peace and of mercy when he be half way to the priory he meet small pony carriage which be rattle towards bedsworth at great pace drive by good look middle aged lady with small page by her side the merchant encounter this equipage in narrow country lane without footpath and as it approach he he could not help observe that the lady wear an indignant and gloomy look upon her feature which be out of keep with their general contour her forehead be contract into very decide frown and her lip be gather into what might be describe as negative smile girdlestone stand aside to let her pass but the lady by sudden twitch of her right hand rein bring the wheel across in so sudden manner that they be within an ace of go over his toe he only save himself by spring back into gap of the hedge as it be he find on look down that his pearl grey trouser be cover with flake of wet mud what make the incident more perplexing be that both the middle aged lady and the page laugh very heartily as they rattle away to the village the merchant proceed on his way marvel in his heart at the uncharitableness and innate wickedness of unregenerated human nature good mrs. scully little dreamed of the urgency of the case have she see the telegram which john girdlestone have just despatch it be conceivable that she might have read between the word and by act more promptly have prevent terrible crime as matter of fact with all her sympathy the worthy woman have take large part of kate 's story with the proverbial grain of salt it seem to she to be incredible and impossible that in this nineteenth century such thing as deliberate and carefully plan murder should occur in christian england that these thing occur in the abstract we be ready to admit but we find it very difficult to realize that they may come within the horizon of our own experience hence mrs. scully set no importance upon kate 's fear for her life and put they down to the excited state of the girl 's imagination she do consider it however to be very iniquitous and unjustifiable thing that young girl should be coope up and separate from all the world in such very dreary place of seclusion as the priory this consideration and nothing more serious have set that look of wrath upon her pleasant face and have stir she up to frustrate girdlestone and to communicate with kate 's friend her intention have be to telegraph to london but as she drive to bedsworth she bethink she how impossible it would be for she within the limit of telegram to explain to her satisfaction all that she want to express letter she reflect would if post now reach the major by the first post on saturday morning it would simply mean few hour delay in the taking of step to relieve kate and what difference could few hour more or less make to the girl she determine therefore that she would write to the major explain all the circumstance and leave it to he what course of action should be pursue mrs. scully be well known at the post office and they quickly accommodate she with the requisite for correspondence within quarter of an hour she have write seal stamp and post the follow epistle dearest toby,"i be afraid you must find your period of probation very slow poor boy what do he do no billiard no card no betting how do he manage to get through the day at all smoke suppose and look out of the window and tell all his

of course by her friend she mean that curly head mr. dimsdale that you speak of the poor girl be in very low nervous state and tell i over the wall of the park that she fear her guardian have design on her life can hardly believe that but do think that she be far from well and that it be enough to drive she mad to coop she up like that we must get she out somehow or another suppose that her guardian be within his right and that it be not police matter you must consider what must be do and let young dimsdale know if you think good he will want to come down to see she no doubt and if toby be to come too should not be sorry "i should have telegraph about it but could not explain myself sufficiently assure you that the poor girl be in very bad way and we ca n't be too energetic in what we do it be very sad to hear the positive manner in which she declare that her guardian would murder she though she do not attempt to give any reason why he should commit such terrible crime we see horrid one eyed man at the gate who appear to be on guard to prevent any one from come out or in on our way to bedsworth we meet no less person than the great mr. girdlestone himself and we actually

cab and rattle away to phillimore gardens and thence to the office without be able to find the man of whom he be in search he then rush down the strand as quickly as he could intend to catch the next train and go alone but on his way to waterloo station he fall in with tom dimsdale as record in precede chapter the letter be thunderbolt to tom in his bad dream he have never imagine anything so dark as this he hurry back to the station at such pace that the poor major be reduce to most asthmatical and wheezy condition he trot along pluckily however and as he go hear the account of tom 's adventure in the morning and of the departure of ezra girdlestone and of his red bearded companion the major 's face grow more anxious still when he hear of it pray god we may not be too late he pant when kate have make clean breast of all her trouble to the widow scully and have secure that good woman 's co operation great weight seem to have be lift from her heart and she spring from the shed different woman it would soon be like dream all these dreary week in the grim old house within day she be sure that either tom or the major would find mean of communicate with she the thought make she so happy that the colour steal back into her cheek and she sing for very lightness of heart as she make she way back to the priory mrs. jorrocks and rebecca observe the change which have come over she and marvel at it kate attempt to aid the former in her household work but the old crone refuse her assistance and repulse she harshly her maid too answer she curtly when she address she and eye she in anything but friendly manner "you do n't seem much the bad she remark for all the wonderful thing you seed in the night ""oh do n't speak of it say kate be afraid that have give you great fright be feel far from well and suppose that must have imagine all about that dreadful monk yet at the time assure you that see it as plainly as see you now ""what be that she say ask mrs. jorrocks with her hand to her ear "she say that she see ghost last night as plain as she see you now ""pack of nonsense cry the old woman rattle the poker in the grate 've be here afore she come all alone in the house

contrariness to say so old mrs. jorrocks cry hoarsely she be always contradictin' ""you're not in good temper to day kate remark and go off to her room go up the step two at time with her old springy footstep rebecca follow she and notice the change interpret it in her own narrow fashion "you seem cheerful enough now she say stand at kate 's door and look into her room with bitter smile on her lip to morrow be saturday that be what be the matter with you ""to morrow saturday kate repeat in astonishment "yes you know what mean well enough it be no use pretend that you don't "the girl 's manner be so aggressive that kate be astonish "i have n't the least idea of what you mean she say "oh no cry rebecca with her arm akimbo and sneer on her face she do n't know what mean she do n't know that her young man be come down on the saturday she do not know that mr. ezra come all the way from london on that day just for to see she it be n't that that make you cheerful be it oh you double face the girl 's pretty feature be all distort with malice as she speak and her two hand be clench passionately "rebecca cry kate energetically really think that you be the most complete fool that ever meet in my life will trouble you to remember that be your mistress and you be my servant how dare you speak to i in such way leave my room this instant!"the girl stand her ground as though she intend to brazen it out but kate sweep towards she with so much honest anger in her voice and such natural dignity in her bearing that she sink her bold gaze and with few muttered word slunk away into her own room kate close the door behind she and then her sense of the ludicrous overpower her anger she laugh for the first time since she have be in the priory it be so intensely ridiculous that even the most foolish of mortal should imagine that she could under any circumstance be desirous of see ezra girdlestone the very thought of he bring she amusement to an end for the maid be right and to morrow would bring he down once more perhaps her friend might arrive before he do god grant it!it be cold but bright day from her window she could see the snow white sail of the hampshire fishing boat dip and rise against the deep blue sea single barque rode amongst they like swan among duckling beat up against the wind for portsmouth or southampton away on the right be the long line of white foam which mark the winner sands the tide be in and the great mudbank have disappear save that here and there their dun colour convexity rise above the surface like the back of sleep leviathan overhead great flock of wild geese be flap their way southward like broad arrow against the sky it be an exhilarating brace scene and accord well with her own humour she feel so full of life and hope that she could hardly believe that she be the same girl who that very morning have hurl away the poison bottle know in her heart that unless she destroy it she might be tempt to follow her guardian 's sinister suggestion yet the incident be real enough for there be the fragment of glass scatter over the bare plank of her floor and the insidious odour of the drug be still so strong that she open the window in order to dissipate it look back at it now it all seem like some hideous nightmare she have no very clear idea as to what she expect her friend to do that she would be save and that speedily she never for one instantdoubte she have only to wait patiently and all would be well by to morrow night at the late her trouble would be over so think girdlestone too as he sit down below with his head bent upon his breast and his eye look moodily from under his shaggy brow at the glowing coal to morrow evening would settle the matter once and for ever burt and ezra would be down by five o'clock and that would be the beginning of the end as to burt 's future there be no difficulty about that he be broken man if well supply with unlimited liquor he would not live long to trouble they he have nothing to gain and everything to lose by denounce they should the bad come to the bad the raving of dipsomaniac could do little harm to man as respected as the african merchant every event have be foresee and provide for by the old schemer above all he have devise method by which even coroner 's inquiry could be face with impunity and which would do away with all necessity for elaborate concealment he beckon mrs. jorrocks over to he for he have be sit in the large room which be use both as dining room and as kitchen "what be the late train to morrow he ask "there be one that reach bedsworth at quarter to ten ""it pass the ground at about twenty to ten then?""that reg'lar that could set my clock by it ""that'll do where be miss harston?""upstair sir she come back laughin and jumpin and as sassy as you please to they as be old before she be bear ""laughing say girdlestone raise his eyebrow she do not seem in laugh mood this morning you do n't think she have go out of her mind do you?""i do n't know nought about that there be rebecca come down here cryin 'cause she 'd order she out of her room oh she be mistress of the house there be no doubt about that she 'll be givin of we all the sack presently "girdlestone relapse into silence but his face show that he be puzzle by what he have hear kate sleep sound and dreamless sleep that night at her age trouble be shake from the young mind like water from the feather of duck it have be all very gloomy and terrible while it last but now the dawn of well day have come she wake cheerful and light hearted she feel that when once she be free she could forgive her guardian and rebecca and all of they even ezra she would bury the whole hideous incident and never think of it or refer to it again she amuse herself that morning by reckon up in her mind what the sequence of event would be in london and how long it would be before she hear from her friend if mrs. scully have telegraph news would have reach they last night probably she would write as well give all the particular about she the post come in about nine o'clock she think then some time would elapse before the major could find tom after that no doubt they would have to consider what have well be do and perhaps would go and consult with dr. dimsdale that would occupy the morning and part of the afternoon they could hardly reach the priory before nightfall ezra would be down by that time
