""you'll have my father out presently with your damn noise say ezra "get away and wash your face "his word be law to she and she turn away still weep bitterly in her poor dim eventless life the sole bright spot have be the attention which the young merchant have occasionally show she to her distorted fancy he be man among man hero all that be admirable and magnificent what be there which she would not do for he she have the faithfulness of dog but like dog she would snarl fiercely at any one who come between her master 's affection and herself deep down in her heart rankle the one suspicion which no assurance could remove that an understanding exist between the man she love and the woman she hate as she withdraw to her room she determine that during this visit of ezra 's she would manage in such way that no communication could pass between they without her knowledge she know that it be dangerous thing to play the spy upon the young man for he have show she before now that her sex be no precaution against his brutality nevertheless she set herself to do it with all the cunning and perseverance of jealous woman as the light fade and the grey of evening deepen into darkness kate sit patiently in her bare little room coal fire sputter and sparkle in the rusty grate and there be tin bucket full of coal beside the fender from which to replenish it she be very cold so she draw her single chair up to the blaze and hold her hand over it it be lonesome and melancholy vigil while the wind whistle through the branch of the tree and moan drearily in the crack and cranny of the old house when be her friend come perhaps something have occur to detain they to day this morning such thing would have appear to she to be an impossibility but now that the time have come when she have expect they it appear probable enough that something might have delay they to morrow at late they could not fail to come she wonder what they would do if they do arrive would they come boldly up the avenue and claim she from the girdlestones or would they endeavour to communicate with her first whatever they decide upon would be sure to be for the good she go to the window once and look out it promise to be wild night far away in the south west lie great cumulus of rugged cloud from which dark streamer radiate over the sky like the advance guard of an army here and there pale star twinkle dimly out through the rift but the great part of the heavens be black and threatening it be so dark that she could no long see the sea but the crash booming sound of the great wave fill the air and the salt spray come drive in through the open window she shut it and resume her seat by the fire shiver partly from cold and partly from some vague presentiment of evil an hour or more have pass when she hear step upon the stair and knock come to her door it be rebecca with cup of tea upon tray and some bread and butter kate be grateful at this attention for it save she from have to go down to the dining room and face ezra and his unpleasant look companion rebecca lay down the tray and then to her mistress 's surprise turn back and shut the door the girl 's face be very pale and her manner be wild and excited "here be note for you she say it be give mrs. jorrocks to give you but be well at climb stair than she be so bring it up she hand kate little slip of paper as she speak note for she could it be that her friend have arrive and have manage to send message to she it must be so she take it from the maid as she do so she notice that the other 's hand be shake as though she have the ague you be not well rebecca say kate kindly oh yes be you read your note and do n't mind i the girl answer in her usual surly fashion instead of leave the room she be bustle about the bed as though put thing in order kate 's impatience be too great to allow she to wait so she untwist the paper which have no seal or fastening she have hope in her heart to see the name of her lover at the end of it instead of that her eye fall upon the signature of ezra girdlestone what could he have to say to she she move the solitary candle on to the mantelpiece and read the follow note roughly scribble upon coarse piece of paper my dear miss harston.""i be afraid your confinement here have be very irksome to you have repeatedly request my father to alleviate or modify it but he have invariably refuse as he still persist in his refusal wish to offer you my aid and to show you that be your sincere friend in spite of all that have pass it you could slip out to night at nine o'clock and meet i by the withered oak at the head of the avenue shall see you safe to bedsworth and you can if you wish go on to portsmouth by the next train shall manage so that you may find the door open by that time shall not of course go to portsmouth with you but shall return here after drop you at the station do this small thing to show you that hopeless as it may be the affection which bear you be still as deep as ever ""yours e. girdlestone."our heroine be so surprised at this epistle that she sit for some time dangle the slip of paper between her finger and lose in thought when she glance round rebecca have leave the room she roll the paper up and throw it into the fire ezra then be not so hard hearted as she have think he he have use his influence to soften his father should she accept this chance of escape or should she wait some word from her friend perhaps they be already in bedsworth but do not know how to communicate with she if so this offer of ezra 's be just what be need in any case she could go on to portsmouth and telegraph from there to the dimsdales it be too good an offer to be refuse she make up her mind that she would accept it it be past eight now and nine be the hour she stand up with the intention of put on her cloak and her bonnet this conversation with rebecca have suggest to ezra that he might still have influence enough with his father 's ward to induce she to come out of door and so put herself within the reach of burt he have propose the plan to his father who approve of it heartily the only weak point in his scheme have be the difficulty which might arise in induce the girl to venture out of the priory on that tempestuous winter 's night there be evidently only one incentive strong enough to bring it about and that be the hope of escape by harp skilfully upon this string they might lure she into the trap ezra and his father compose the letter together and the former hand it to mrs. jorrocks with request that she should deliver it it chance however that rebecca keenly alive to any attempt at communication between the young merchant and her mistress see the crone hobble down the passage with the note in her hand "what be that mother she ask "it be letter for she wheeze the old woman nod her tremulous head in the direction of kate 's room "i'll take it up say rebecca eagerly be just go up there with her tea ""thank ye they stair try my rheumatiz something cruel "the maid take the note and carry it upstairs instead of take it straight to her mistress she slip into her own room and read every word of it it appear to confirm her bad suspicion here be ezra ask an interview with the woman whom he have assure she that he hate it be true that the request be make in measured word and on plausible pretext no doubt that be merely to deceive any other eye which might rest upon it there be an understanding between they and this be an assignation the girl walk swiftly up and down the room like cage tigress strike her head with her clenched hand in her anger and bite her lip until the blood come it be some time before she could overcome her agitation sufficiently to deliver the note and when she do so her mistress as we have see notice that her manner be nervous and wild she little dreamed of the struggle which be go on in the dark eyed girl 's mind against the impulse which urge she to seize her imagine rival by the white throat and choke the life out of she "it 's eight o'clock now ezra be say downstairs wonder whether she will come?""she be sure to come his father say briefly "suppose she didn't?""in that case we should find other mean to bring she out we have not go so far to break down over trifle at the last moment ""i must have something to drink ezra say after pause help himself from the bottle feel as cold as ice and as nervous as cat ca n't understand how you look so unconcerned if you be go to sign an invoice or audit an account or anything else in the way of business you could not take it more calmly wish the time would come this waiting be terrible ""let we pass the time to advantage say john girdlestone and draw little fat bible from his pocket he begin to read it aloud in solemn and sonorous voice the yellow light illuminate the old merchant 's massive feature as he stoop forwards towards the candle his strongly marked nose and his hollow cheek give he vulture like aspect which be increase by the effect of his deep set glitter eye ezra lean back in his chair with the firelight flicker over his haggard but still handsome face look across at his father with puzzled expression he have never yet be able to determine whether the old man be consummate hypocrite or religious monomaniac burt lie with his foot in the light of the fire and his head sink back across the arm of the chair fast asleep and snore loudly "isn't it time to wake he up ezra ask interrupt the reading "yes think it be his father answer close the sacred volume reverently and replace it in his bosom ezra take up the candle and hold it over the sleep man what brute he look he say do ever you see such an animal in your life?"the navvy be certainly not pretty sight his muscular arm

and unhealthy while his thick lip puff out with whistle sound at every expiration his dirty brown coat be throw open and out of one of the pocket protrude short thick cudgel with leaden head john girdlestone pick it out and try it in the air think could kill an ox with this he say "don't wave it about my head cry ezra as you stand in the firelight brandish that stick in your long arm you be less attractive than usual "john girdlestone smile and replace the cudgel in the sleeper 's pocket wake up burt he cry shake he by the arm it be half past eight "the navvy start to his foot with an oath and then fall back into his chair stare round he vacantly at loss as to where he might be his eye fall upon the bottle of hollands which be now nearly empty and he hold out his hand to it with an exclamation of recognition "i've be asleep guv'nor he say hoarsely must have dram to set i straight do you say it be time for the job ""we have make arrangement by which she will be out by the

the door it be blow half gale now and the wind be bitterly cold there come melancholy rasp and rustle from the leafless wood and every now and again sharp crackling sound would announce that some rotten branch have come crash down the cloud drive across the face of the moon so that at time the cold clear light silver the dark wood and the old monastery while at other all be plunge in darkness from the open door broad golden bar be shoot across the lawn from the lamp in the hall the three dark figure with their long fantastic shadow look eerie and unnatural in the yellow glare "are we to

hand involuntarily go up to the old scar think such one as that would settle she he say as he withdraw with his father the two take up their position under the shadow of some tree fifty yard off or more burt crouch down behind the withered oak with his weapon in his hand and wait for the coming of his victim ezra though usually resolute and daring have completely lose his nerve and his tooth be chatter in his head his father on the other hand be emotionless and impassive as ever "it be close upon nine o'clock ezra whisper "ten minute to say the other peer at his great golden chronometer through the darkness "what if she fail to come?""we must devise other mean of bring she out "from the spot where they stand they have view of the whole of the priory she could not come out without be

the spot where the confederate be crouch in the centre of the zone of light there stand figure the figure of the girl even at that distance they could distinguish the pearl grey mantle which she usually wear and the close fit bonnet she have wrap shawl round the low part of her face to protect she from the boisterous wind for minute or more she stand peer out into the darkness of the night as though uncertain whether to proceed or to go back then with quick sudden gesture she close the door behind she the light be no long there but they know that she be outside the house and that the appointment would be keep what an age it seem before they hear her footstep she come very slowly put one foot gingerly before the other as if afraid of fall over something in the darkness once or twice she stop altogether look round no doubt to make sure of her whereabouts at that instant the moon shine out from behind cloud and they see her dark figure short distance on the light enable she to see the withered oak for she come rapidly towards it as she approach she satisfy herself apparently that she be the first on the ground for she slacken her pace once more and walk in the listless way that people assume when they be wait the cloud be overtake the moon again and the light be get dimmer "i can see she still say ezra in whisper grasp his father 's wrist in his excitement the old man say nothing but he peer through the darkness with eager strain eye "there she be stand out little from the oak the young merchant say point with quiver finger she be not near enough for he to reach she ""he be come out from the shadow now the other say huskily "don't you see he crawl along the ground?""i see he return the other in the same subdue awestruck voice now he have stop now he go on again my god he be close behind she she be look the other way "a thin ray of light shoot down between the cloud in its silvery radiance two figure stand out hard and black that of the unconscious
