we can lock up the shop it 'll have to take care of itself until we come back "the two gentleman walk down to the edge of the sea there be little dinghy there and the boat be anchor couple of hundred yard off they could just make out the loom of she through the darkness and see her shadowy spar dipping rise and fall with the wash of the wave to right and leave spread the long white line of thunder foam as though the ocean be some great beast of prey which be gnash its glisten tooth at they the gale have partially die away but there still come fitful gust from the south west and the thick cloud overhead be sweep in majestic procession across the sky and fall like dark cataract over the horizon show that up there at least there be no lull in the temp it be bitterly cold and both man button up their coat and slap their hand against each other to preserve their warmth after some little delay sampson and his son come down from the hut with lantern in each of their hand they have lock the door behind they which show that they be ready for final start by the light which they carry it could be see that they be dress in yellow suit of oilskin and sou'wester hat as if prepare for wet night "you

into the surf and the two seaman clamber in after ezra and his father sit in the sheet while the other row the sea be run very high so high that when the dinghy lie in the trough of wave they could see neither the boat for which they be steer nor the shore which they have leave nothing indeed but the black line of hiss water above their head at time they would go up until they hang on the crest of great roller and see the dark valley gape beyond into which they be forthwith precipitate sometimes when they be high upon wave the fishing boat would be between the sea and then there would be nothing of her visible except the upper portion of her mast it be only couple of hundred yard but seem long journey to the shiver fugitive "stand by with the boat hook sampson cry at last the dark outline of the boat be loom immediately above they "all right father "the dinghy be hold alongside and the two gentleman scramble aboard as well they could follow by their companion "have you the painter jarge?""ay ay ""make it fast aft then!"the lad fasten the rope which hold the dinghy to stanchion beside the tiller then he and his father proceed to hoist the foresail so as to get the boat 's head round "she'll do now sampson cry give we hand here sir if you do n't mind "ezra catch hold of the rope which be hand he and pull for some time it be relief to he to have something however small which would distract his mind from the event of the night "that will do sir the skipper cry and lean over the bow he seize the anchor which ezra have haul up and tumble it with crash on the deck "now jarge with three reef in she we might give she the mains'le "with much pull at rope and with many strange nautical cry the father and the son aid by their passenger succeed in raise the great brown sail the little vessel lie over under the pressure of the wind until her lee bulwark be flush with the water and the deck lie at such an angle that it be only by hold on to the weather rig that the two gentleman could retain their footing the wild wave swirl and foam round her bow and beat at her quarter and beneath her counter but the little boat rise gallantly to they and shoot away through the storm run due eastward "it ai n't much of cabin sampson say apologetically such as it be you 'll find it down there ""thank you answer ezra we 'll stay on deck at present when ought we to get to the downs?""at this rate we 'll be there by to morrow afternoon ""thank you "the fisherman and his boy take turn and turn one steering and the other keep look out forward and trim the sail the two passenger crouch huddle together against the weather rail they be each too occupy with thought to have time for speech suddenly after pass claxton and round the point they come in full sight of the priory every window of which be blaze with light they could see dark figure pass to and fro against the glare "look there girdlestone whisper "ay the police have not take long his son answer john girdlestone be silent for some time then he suddenly drop his face upon his hand and sob hoarsely for the first and last time in his career "i be think of monday in fenchurch street he say my god be this the end of life of hard work oh my business my business that build up myself it will break my heart!"and so through the long cold winter 's night they sit together while the boat plough its way down the english channel who shall say what their thought be as they stare with pale rigid face into the darkness while their mind perhaps peer even more cheerlessly into the dismal obscurity which lie over their future well be the lifeless wreck whom they have carry up to the priory than be tear as these man be tear by the demon of fear and remorse and grief and crush down by the weight of sin stain and irrevocable past the ruffian burt be so horror stricken at the sight of the girl whom he imagine that he have murder that he lie grovel on the railway line by the side of his victim moan with terror and incapable of any resistance he be promptly seize by the major 's party and the nihilist secure his hand with handkerchief so quickly and effectively that it be clearly not the first time that he have perform the feat he then calmly draw very long and bright knife from the recess of his frock coat and having press it against burt 's nose to ensure his attention he brandish it in front of he in menacing way as hint that an attempt at escape might be dangerous "and who be di ask baumser lift up the dead woman 's head and rest it upon his knee "poor girl she will niver spake again whoever she may have be the major say hold the lantern to her cold pale face here be where the coward strike she death must have be instantaneous and painless could have swear it be the young lady we come afther if it be not that we have she safe down there thank the lord!""vere be those oder ask von baumser peer about through the darkness if dere be justice in de country dey vill hang for the work of dis night ""they be off the major answer lay the girl 's head reverently down again it be hopeless to follow they as we know nothing of the counthry nor which direction they take they run like madman hullo what the divil can this be?"the sight which have attract the veteran 's attention be nothing less than the appearance at the end of the lane of three brilliant luminous disc move along abreast of one another they come rapidly near increase in brilliancy as they approach then voice ring out of the darkness there they be officer close with they do n't let 'em get away and before the major and his party could quite grasp the situation they be valiantly charge by three of those much endure stout hearted mortal know as the british police force it take courage to plunge into the boiling surf and to carry the rope to the break vessel it take courage to spring from the ship 's side and support the struggle swimmer never know the moment at which flicker shadow may appear in the deep green water and the tiger of the deep turn its white belly upwards as it dash on its prey there be courage too in the infantryman who take sturdy grip of his rifle and plant his foot firmly as he see the lancers sweep down on his comrade and himself but of all these type of bravery there be none that can compare with that of our homely constable when he find on the dark november night that door on his beat be ajar and listen below learn that the time have come to show the manhood that be in he he must fight odd in the dark he must single handed cage up desperate man like rat in hole he must oppose his simple weapon to the six shooter and the life preserver all these thought and the remembrance of his wife and child at home and of how easy it would be not to observe the open door come upon he and then what do he do why with the thought of duty in his heart and his little cudgel in his hand he go to what be too often his death like valiant high minded englishman who fear the reproach of his own conscience more than pistol bullet or bludgeon stroke which digression may serve to emphasize the fact that these three burly hampshire policeman having be place upon our friend track by the ostler of theflying bull and have themselves observe manoeuvre which could only be characterize as suspicious charge down with such vehemence that in less time than it take to tell it both tom and the major and von baumser be in safe custody the nihilist who have an unextinguishable hatred of the law and who could never be bring to understand that it might under any circumstance be on his side pull himself very straight and hold his knife down at his hip as though he mean to use it while bulow of kiel likewise assume an aggressive attitude fortunately however the appearance of their prisoner and few hurried word from the major make the inspector in charge understand how the land lie and he transfer his attention to burt on whose wrist he place the handcuff he then listen to more detailed account of the circumstance from the lip of the major "who be this young lady he ask point to kate "this be the miss harston whom we come to rescue and for whom no doubt the blow be
