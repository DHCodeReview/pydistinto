no bottom in she she be bind to be in danger be the weather fair or foul ""do you mean to tell i this ship have no bottom?""i mean to tell you that there be place where you could put your finger through her seam it be only the pumpin that keep she afloat ""this be pretty state of thing say girdlestone how be it that have not be inform of it before it be most dangerous ""informed cry miggs inform of it have there be v'yage yet that have n't come to ye muster girdlestone and tell ye be surprised ever to find myself back in lunnon year agone tell ye how this ship be and ye laugh at i ye do it be only when ye find yourself on she in the middle the broad sea that ye understan what it be that sailor folk have to put up wi' "girdlestone be about to make some angry reply to this address but his son put his hand on his arm to restrain he it would never do to quarrel with hamilton miggs before they reach their port of refuge they be too completely in his power "what the captain say have great deal of truth in it he remark with laugh you do n't realize thing until you 've have to experience it theblack eagleshall certainly have an overhaul next time and we 'll see if we ca n't give her captain an increase at the same time "migg give grunt which might be take as express thank or as signify doubt perhaps there be mixture of both in his mind "i presume girdlestone say in conciliatory voice that there would be no real danger as long as the weather be fine?""it wo n't be fine long the captain answer gruffly the glass be well under thirty when come up and it be fallin fast 've be about here before at this time year in calm with ground swell and sinkin glass no good ever come of it look there at the norrard what d'ye make that sandy?""in conjunction wi the descending glass it have an ominous appairance the scotchman answer with much stress on the first syllable of the adjective the phenomenon which have attract their professional attention do not appear to either of the girdlestones to be very important one the haze on the horizon to the north be rather thick than elsewhere and few thin streaky cloud straggle upwards across the clear cold heaven like the feeler of some giant octopus which lie behind the fog bank at the same time the sea change in place from the appearance of quicksilver to that of grain glass "there be the wind miggs say confidently 'd furl the top gallant sail and get her stay sail down mr. mcpherson whenever he give an order he be careful to give the mate his full title though at other time he call he indiscriminately sandy or mac the mate give the necessary command while migg dive down into the cabin he come up again look even graver than when he leave the deck "the glass be nearly down to twenty eight he say never seed it as low since 've be at sea take in the mains'l mr. mcpherson and have the topsail reef down!""ay ay sir "there be no lack of noise now as the man haul at the halliard with their shrill strange cry which sound like the piping of innumerable sea bird half dozen lie out on the yard above tuck away the great sail and make all snug "take reef in the fores'l the mate roar and look alive about it!""hurry up ye swab migg bellow you 'll be blow away every mother 's son of ye if you do n't stir yourselves!"even the two landsman could see now that the danger be no imaginary one and that storm be about to burst over they the long black line of vapour have lengthen and coalesce until now the whole northern heaven be one great rolling black cloud with an angry ragged fringe which bespoke the violence of the wind that drive it here and there against the deep black background small whitish or sulphur coloured wreath stand clearly out look livid and dangerous the whole great mass be sweep onwards with prodigious and majestic rapidity darken the ocean beneath it and emit dull moaning mutter sound which be indescribably menacing and mournful "this may be the same gale as be on some day ago migg remark they travel in circle very often and come back to where they start from ""we be all snug aloft but this ship wo n't stand much knock about an that be fact observe the mate gloomily it be blow now in short frequent puff which ruffle the surface of the water and cause theblack eagleto surge slowly forward over the roller few drop of rain come patter down upon the deck the great bank of cloud be above the ship still hurry wildly across the heaven "look out cry an old quartermaster here she comes!"as he speak the storm burst with shriek as though all the demon of the air have be suddenly unchained and be rejoice in their freedom the force of the blast be so great that girdlestone could almost have believe that he have be strike by some solid object the barque heel over until her lee rail touch the water and lie so for minute or more in smother of foam her deck be at such an angle that it seem as though she never could right herself gradually however she rise little stagger and tremble like living thing and then plunge away through the storm as piece of paper be whirl before the wind by evening the gale be at its height theblack eaglewas run under maintopsail and foretopmast staysail the sea have rise very quickly as it will when wind come upon swell as far as the eye could see from the summit of wave there be vista of dark tower ridge with their threaten crest of foam when the barque sink in the hollow these gleaming summit rise as high as her mainyard and the two fugitive cling to the weather shroud look up in terror and amazement at the masse of water which hang above they once or twice wave actually break over the vessel crash and roar down the deck and wash hither and thither until gradually absorb between the plank or drain away through the scupper hole on each of these occasion the poor rotten vessel would lurch and shiver in every plank as if with foreknowledge of her fate it be dreary night for all on board as long as there be light they could at least see what danger be to be face but now the barque be plunge and toss through an inky obscurity with wild scooping motion she be hurl up on the summit of great wave and thence she shoot down into the black gulf beyond with such force that when check by meet the next billow her whole fabric jar from truck to keelson there be two seaman at the wheel and two at the relieve tackle yet it be all that they could do among the wild commotion to keep she steady no one thought of go below it be well to see and know the bad than to be shut up in coffin where one could not stretch out hand to help one 's self once captain hamilton miggs claw his way along the rail to where the girdlestones be stand "look there he roar point to windward it be difficult to turn one 's face straight to the wild rush of wind and spray and hail shade their eye they peer into the storm right in the heart of it and apparently not more than couple of hundred yard from the barque be lurid glare of ruddy light rise and fall with the sea but advance rapidly through it there be bright central glowing spot with small light glimmer above and beside it the effect of the single glare of light against the inky darkness of the sea and sky would have make study for turner "what 's that?""it 's steamer the captain shout it be only by great exertion that he could make himself audible above the shrieking of the wind and the dash of the wave "what do you think of it all ezra ask "very bad migg answer could n't be bad and with that he claw his way aft again grasp every stanchion or shroud on his way like parroquet in cage the cloud above break somewhat towards morning but there be no sign of abatement in the temp here and there through the rift the glimmer of the star might be see and once the pale moon gleam through the storm wreath the dawn break cheerless and dreary disclose the great turmoil of endless slate colour wave and the solitary little barque with her rag of canvas like break wing seabird stagger to the south even the girdlestones have notice that whereas towards the commencement of the storm it have be rare occurrence for wave to break over the ship the deck be now continually knee deep in water and there be constant splashing and crash as the sea curl over the weather bulwark miggs have already observe it and confer gravely with his mate on the point "i do n't like the look of she mac he shout she do n't rise to they ""she 's near water log be thinkin the mate respond gravely he know the danger and his thought be wander away to little slate tile cottage near peterhead it be true that there be not much in it save wife who be say to give sandy the rough side of her tongue and occasionally something rough still affection be capricious emotion however and will cling to the most unlikely object so the big scotchman 's eye be damp with something else beside the sea spray as he realize that he might never look upon cottage or occupant again "no wonder say miggs when she be takin in water above and below too the man be weary wi pumpin and it still gain ""i doot it be our last v'yage thgither the mate remark his scottish accent wax broad under the influence of emotion "what d'ye say to heavin her to?""i'd let she run on she would na rise tae the wave be fearin we canna be vera fa frae the spanish coast accordin to my surmisation that wud gie we chance savin oorsel though be fear na boat would live in siccan sea ""you're right we have well chance so than if we let she ride she 'd founder as sure as egg be egg damn it mac could almost be glad this have happen now we 've get they two aboard we 'll teach 'em what coffin ship be like in gale wind the rough seaman laugh hoarsely as he speak the carpenter come aft at this moment balance himself as well he could for the deck be only few degree off the perpendicular "the leak be gain fast he say the hand be clean do up there be land on the port bow "the mate and the captain peer out through the dense wrack and haze great dark cliff loom out upon the left jagged inhospitable and menacing "we'd well run towards it the mate say we 've na chance save the ship but we might run she ashore ""the ship will go down before you reach it the carpenter remark gloomily "keep your heart up miggs shout and then crawl along to the girdlestones there be no hope for the ship but we may save ourselves he say you 'll have to take your turn at the pump "they follow he forward without word the crew listless and weary be group about the pump the feeble clanking sound like the ticking of watch amid the horrible uproar which fill the air "buckle to again boy cry miggs these two will help you and the carpenter and mate "ezra and his father the old man 's grizzle lock fly wildly from his head seize the rope and work with the crew hardly able to retain their foothold upon the slippery slope deck migg go down into the cabin his behaviour during the gale have be most exemplary but he recognize now that there be nothing more to be do and having throw off his public responsibility he renew his private peculiarity he fill out nearly tumblerful of raw rum and take it off at gulp then he begin to sing and make his way on deck in very hilarious and reckless mood the vessel be still fly towards the rugged line of cliff which be now visible along the whole horizon the great projection on the left be their culminating point she be obviously sink low in the water and she plunge in heavy sulky manner through the wave instead of rise to they as she do before the water be steadily gain in her interior and it be clear that she would not float long the straining of the gale have increase the long neglect rift between her timber and no amount of pumping could save she on the other hand the sky have break above they and the wind be by no means so violent as before the sun break through between two great hurrying cloud and turn all the wave to the bright emerald green with sparkle snow white crest of foam this sudden change and the brightness of the scene make their fate seem all the hard to the seaman aboard the sink vessel "the gale be clearin remark mcpherson if we have have ship that wasna rotten to the hairt like her owner we 'd ha pu'ed through ""right you be old sandy but we be all goin' together captain and owner and the whole bilin yell migg recklessly the mate look at he half in surprise and half in contempt "you've be at the bottle he say eh mun mun if we be a'droone as seem likely it be an awfu thing to appear before yourmaker wi your meeserable soul steeped in drink ""you go down and have drink yourself migg cry huskily "na na if be to dee 'll dee sober ""you'll die fool the skipper shout wrathfully "well old preacher you 've bring we into nice hole with your damned insurance cheating cheese pare business what d'ye think of it now when the ship 's settlin down under our foot eh would you repair she if you have she back in the albert dock eh?"this speech be address to the old merchant who have cease pumping and be lean against the cuddy and look up hopelessly at the long line of brown cliff which be now only half mile away they could hear the roar of the surf and see the white breaker where the atlantic storm in all its fury against nature 's break water "he be not fit to command say ezra to the mate what would you advise?""we'll bring she round and lower the boat on the lee side they may live or no but it be the only chance for we they twa boat will hold we easy "the ship be settle down in the water so fast that it be no difficult matter to let the boat down they only hang few foot above the surface the majority of the crew get safely into the long boat and the girdlestones with miggs and four seaman occupy the gig it be no easy thing to prevent the boat from be stove as the wave alternately drive they from the ship 's side or bring the two together with force which seem irresistible by skilful management however they both succeed in cast off and get clear without accident it be only when they emerge from under the shelter of the vessel that they feel the full power of the sea if it have appear stupendous when they trod the deck of the barque how much more so now when by lean the arm over the side they could touch the surface the great glassy green billow hurl they up and down and toss they and buffet they as though the two boat be their plaything and they be try what antic they could perform with they without destroy they girdlestone sit very grim and pale with ezra at his side the young fellow 's expression be that of daring man who realize his danger but be determined to throw no chance of safety away his mouth be set firm and hard and his dark eyebrow be draw down over his keen eye which glance swiftly to right and leave like rat in trap migg hold the tiller and laugh from time to time in drunken fashion while the four seaman quiet and subdue steady the boat as long as they could with their oar and look occasionally over their shoulder at the breaker behind they the sun be shine on the rugged precipice show out the green turf upon their summit and little dark group of peasant who be watch the scene from above but make no effort to assist the castaway there be no alternative but to row straight in for the near point of land for the boat be fill and might go down at any moment "the ship be go ezra say as they rise on the summit of wave when they come up again all look round but there be no sign of the ill fatedblack eagle ."we'll all be go when we get among the breaker shout captain hamilton miggs pull ye devil pull beat the mate 's boat it be race my lad and the winnin post be hell "ezra glance at his father and see that his lip be move tremulously as they patter forth prayer "still at it he say with sneer "make my peace the old man say solemnly my faith be now indeed staff and comfort look back at my long life and though humbly confess that have err and err grievously still in the main have walk straight from my youth have be frugal and industrious oh my boy look with candid eye into your own heart and see if you be fit to be call away ""look to your own beam ezra answer keep his eye upon the line of boiling surf which come near and near every moment how about john harston 's daughter eh even at that awful hour ezra feel sinister pleasure at observe the spasm which shoot across his father 's face at the mention of his ward "if sin sin for worthy purpose he answer it be to preserve my business its fall be blow to righteousness and triumph to evil into thy hand commend my spirit!"as he speak great wave hurl the boat in upon its broad bosom and fling it down upon the cruel jagged rock which bristle from the base of the cliff there be horrible rending crash and the stout keel snap asunder while second wave sweep over it tear out the struggle occupant and bear they on only to hurl they upon second ridge beyond the peasant upon the cliff give piteous cry of grief and pity which blend with the agonize groan and scream of drown man and the thunder of the pitiless surge look down they could see the black dot which indicate the head of the poor wretch below diminish one by one as they be hurl upon the rock or drag down by the under current ezra be strong swimmer but when he have shake himself free of the boat and kick away seaman who cling to he he make no attempt to strike out he know that the wave would bear he quickly enough on to the rock and he reserve himself for the struggle with they great roller came surge over the outlying reef it carry he in like feather and hurl he up against the face of the cliff as he struggle upon its crest he mechanically put out his hand and seize projecting portion of the rock the shock of the contact be tremendous but he retain his grasp and find himself when the wave recede stand batter and breathless upon small niche in the front of the rock which just give he foothold it be marvellous escape for look on either side he could not see any break in the sheer declivity he be by no mean safe as yet if wave have land he there another might come as high and drag he away look down he see one or two small one break into spray far below he and then second great green billow came roll majestically towards he he eye it as it came foam in and calculate that it would come at least as high as his knee would it drag he back with it or could he hold his own he brace himself as firmly as he could place his foot apart and dig his nail into the inequality of the rock until the blood gush from they the water surge up upon he and he feel it tug like some murderous demon at his leg but he hold on bravely until the pressure decrease look below the saw the wave sink down the face of the cliff another wave overtake it and well it up again and then from the depth of the green water ezra see long white arm shoot up and grasp the edge of the ledge upon which he stand even before the face appear the young man know that the hand be his father 's second follow the first and then the old merchant 's face be uplift from the wave he be cruelly bruise and batter and his clothe have be partly tear away he recognize his son however and look up at he beseechingly while he hold on with all his strength to the ledge of rock so small be the space that his cling finger touch ezra 's toe "there be no room here the young man say brutally "for god 's sake!""hardly room for one "the merchant be hang with the low portion of his body in the water it be but few instant but the old man have time to think of many an incident in his past life once more he see the darken sick room and his own form stand by the bed of the die man what be these word which ring in his ear above the crash of the surf may your flesh and blood treat you as you treat she he look up appeal at his son ezra see that the next wave would lift he right up on to the ledge in that case he might be hustle off "leave go he cry "help i ezra "his son bring down his heavy heel upon the bloodless hand the old african trader give wild shriek and fall back into the sea look down ezra see his despairing face gaze at he through the water slowly it sink until it be but flicker white patch far down in the green depth at the same instant thick rope come dangle down the face of the cliff and the young man know that he be save great be the excitement of the worthy couple at phillimore gardens when kate harston be bring back to they good mrs. dimsdale press she to her ample bosom and kiss she and scold she and weep over she while the doctor be so move that it be only by assume an expression of portentous severity and by bellow and stamp about that he be able to keep himself in decent control "and you really think we have forget you because we be insane enough to stop write at that villain 's request he say pat kate 's pale cheek tenderly and kiss she "i be very foolish she say blush prettily and rearrange her hair which have be somewhat tumble by her numerous caress "oh that scoundrel that pair of scoundrel roar the doctor shake his fist and dance about on the hearth rug pray god they may catch 'em before the trial come off!"the good physician 's prayer be not answer in this case for burt be the only criminal who appear in the dock our friend all go down to the winchester assizes to give evidence and the navvy be duly convict of the death of rebecca taylforth and condemn to death he be execute some three week afterwards die as he have live stolid and unrepenting there be little
