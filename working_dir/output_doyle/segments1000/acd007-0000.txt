john fothergill west student of law in the university of st. andrews have endeavour in the ensue page to lay my statement before the public in concise and business like fashion it be not my wish to achieve literary success nor have any desire by the grace of my style or by the artistic ordering of my incident to throw deep shadow over the strange passage of which shall have to speak my high ambition be that those who know something of the matter should after read my account be able to conscientiously indorse it without find single paragraph in which have either add to or detract from the truth should attain this result shall rest amply satisfied with the outcome of my first and probably my last venture in literature it be my intention to write out the sequence of event in due order depend on trustworthy hearsay when be describe that which be beyond my own personal knowledge have now however through the kind cooperation of friend hit upon plan which promise to be less onerous to i and more satisfactory to the reader this be nothing less than to make use of the various manuscript which have by i bear upon the subject and to add to they the first hand evidence contribute by those who have the good opportunity of know major general j. b. heatherstone in pursuance of this design shall lay before the public the testimony of israel stakes formerly coachman at cloomber hall and of john easterling f.r.c.p. edin now practise at stranraer in wigtownshire to these shall add verbatim account extract from the journal of the late john berthier heatherstone of the event which occur in the thul valley in the autumn of 41 towards the end of the first afghan war with description of the skirmish in the terada defile and of the death of the man ghoolab shah to myself reserve the duty of fill up all the gap and chink which may be leave in the narrative by this arrangement have sink from the position of an author to that of compiler but on the other hand my work have cease to be story and have expand into series of affidavit my father john hunter west be well know oriental and sanskrit scholar and his name be still of weight with those who be interested in such matter he it be who first after sir william jones call attention to the great value of early persian literature and his translation from the hafiz and from ferideddin atar have earn the warm commendation from the baron von hammer purgstall of vienna and other distinguish continental critic in the issue of theorientalisches scienzblattfor january 1861 he be describe as"der beruhmte und sehr gelhernte hunter west von edinburgh passage which well remember that he cut out and stow away with pardonable vanity among the most revere family archive he have be bring up to be solicitor or writer to the signet as it be term in scotland but his learn hobby absorb so much of his time that he have little to devote to the pursuit of his profession when his client be seek he at his chamber in george street he be bury in the recess of the advocates library or pore over some mouldy manuscript at the philosophical institution with his brain more exercise over the code which menu propound six hundred year before the birth of christ than over the knotty problem of scottish law in the nineteenth century hence it can hardly be wonder at that as his learning accumulate his practice dissolve until at the very moment when he have attain the zenith of his celebrity he have also reach the nadir of his fortune there be no chair of sanscrit in any of his native university and no demand anywhere for the only mental ware which he have to dispose of we should have be force to retire into genteel poverty console ourselves with the aphorism and precept of firdousi omar khayyam and other of his eastern favourite have it not be for the kindness and liberality of his half brother william farintosh the laird of branksome in wigtownshire this william farintosh be the proprietor of land estate the acreage which bear unfortunately most disproportional relation to its value for it form the bleakest and most barren tract of land in the whole of bleak and barren shire as bachelor however his expense have be small and he have contrive from the rent of his scatter cottage and the sale of the galloway nag which he breed upon the moor not only to live as laird should but to put by considerable sum in the bank we have hear little from our kinsman during the day of our comparative prosperity but just as we be at our wit 's end there come letter like minister angel give we assurance of sympathy and succour in it the laird of branksome tell we that one of his lung have be grow weak for some time and that dr. easterling of stranraer have strongly advise he to spend the few year which be leave to he in some more genial climate he have determine therefore to set out for the south of italy and he beg that we should take up our residence at branksome in his absence and that my father should act as his land steward and agent at salary which place we above all fear of want our mother have be dead for some year so that there be only myself my father and my sister esther to consult and it may be readily imagine that it do not take we long to decide upon the acceptance of the laird 's generous offer my father start for wigtown that very night while esther and follow few day afterwards bear with we two potato sacksful of learn book and such other of our household effect that be worth the trouble and expense of transport branksome might have appear poor dwelling place when compare with the house of an english squire but to we after our long residence in stuffy apartment it be of regal magnificence the building be broad spread and low with red tile roof diamond pan window and profusion of dwell room with smoke blacken ceiling and oaken wainscot in front be small lawn girt round with thin fringe of haggard and ill grow beech all gnarl and wither from the effect of the sea spray behind lie the scatter hamlet of branksome bere dozen cottage at most inhabit by rude fisher folk who look upon the laird as their natural protector to the west be the broad yellow beach and the irish sea while in all other direction the desolate moor greyish green in the foreground and purple in the distance stretch away in long low curve to the horizon very bleak and lonely it be upon this wigtown coast man might walk many weary mile and never see live thing except the white heavy flap kittiwake which scream and cry to each other with their shrill sad voice very lonely and very bleak once out of sight of branksome and there be no sign of the work of man save only where the high white tower of cloomber hall shoot up like headstone of some giant grave from amid the fir and larch which girt it round this great house mile or more from our dwelling have be build by wealthy glasgow merchant of strange taste and lonely habit but at the time of our arrival it have be untenante for many year and stand with weather blotched wall and vacant stare window look blankly out over the hill side empty and mildew it serve only as landmark to the fisherman for they have find by experience that by keep the laird 's chimney and the white tower of cloomber in line they could steer their way through the ugly reef which raise its jagged back like that of some sleep monster above the troubled water of the wind sweep bay to this wild spot it be that fate have bring my father my sister and myself for we its loneliness have no terror after the hubbub and bustle of great city and the weary task of uphold appearance upon slender income there be grand soul soothe serenity in the long sky line and the eager air here at least there be no neighbour to pry and chatter the laird have leave his phaeton and two pony behind he with the aid of which my father and would go the round of the estate do such light duty as fall to an agent or factor as it be there call while our gentle esther look to our household need and brighten the dark old building such be our simple uneventful existence until the summer night when an unlooked for incident occur which prove to be the herald of those strange doing which have take up my pen to describe it have be my habit to pull out of an evening in the laird 's skiff and to catch few whiting which might serve for our supper on this well remember occasion my sister come with i sit with her book in the stern sheet of the boat while hang my line over the bow the sun have sink down behind the rugged irish coast but long bank of flushed cloud still mark the spot and cast glory upon the water the whole broad ocean be seam and scar with crimson streak have rise in the boat and be gaze round in delight at the broad panorama of shore and sea and sky when my sister pluck at my sleeve with little sharp cry of surprise "see john she cry there be light in cloomber tower!"i turn my head and stare back at the tall white turret which peep out above the belt of tree as gaze distinctly see at one of the window the glint of light which suddenly vanish and then shine out once more from another high up there it flicker for some time and finally flash past two successive window underneath before the tree obscure our view of it it be clear that some one bear lamp or candle have climb up the tower stair and have then return into the body of the house "who in the world can it be exclaim speak rather to myself than to esther for could see by the surprise upon her face that she have no solution to offer maybe some of the folk from branksome bere have want to look over the place "my sister shake her head "there be not one of they would dare to set foot within the avenue gate she say besides john the key be keep by the house agent at wigtown be they ever so curious none of our people could find their way in "when reflect upon the massive door and ponderous shutter which guard the low storey of cloomber could not but admit the force of my sister 's objection the untimely visitor must either have use considerable violence in order to force his way in or he must have obtain possession of the key pique by the little mystery pull for the beach with the determination to see for myself who the intruder might be and what be his intention leave my sister at branksome and summon seth jamieson an old man o'-war's man and one of the stout of the fisherman set off across the moor with he through the gathering darkness "it hasna guid name after dark yon hoose remark my companion slacken his pace perceptibly as explain to he the nature of our errand it be no for naethe that he wha own it wunna gang within scotch mile o't ""well seth there be some one who have no fear about go into it say point to the great white building which flicker up in front of we through the gloom the light which have observe from the sea be move backwards and forward past the low floor window the shutter of which have be remove could now see that second fainter light follow few pace behind the other evidently two individual the one with lamp and the other with candle or rushlight be make careful examination of the building "let ilka man blaw his ain parritch say seth jamieson doggedly come to dead stop what be it tae we if wraith or bogle mind tae tak fancy tae cloomber it be no canny tae meddle wi such thing ""why man cry you do n't suppose wraith come here in gig what be those light away yonder by the avenue gates?""the lamp gig sure enough exclaim my companion in less lugubrious voice let 's steer for it master west and speer where she hail frae "by this time night have close in save for single long narrow slit in the westward stumble across the moor together we make our way into the wigtown road at the point where the high stone pillar mark the entrance to the cloomber avenue tall dog cart stand in front of the gateway the horse browse upon the thin border of grass which skirt the road "it be richt say jamieson take close look at the deserted vehicle ken it weel it belong tae maister mcneil the factor body frae wigtown he wha keep the key ""then we may as well have speech with he now that we be here answer they be come down if be not mistaken "as speak we hear the slam of the heavy door and within few minute two figure the one tall and angular the other short and thick come towards we through the darkness they be talk so earnestly that they do not observe we until they have pass through the avenue gate "good evening mr. mcneil say step forward and address the wigtown factor with whom have some slight acquaintance the small of the two turn his face towards i as speak and show i that be not mistaken in his identity but his tall companion spring back and show every sign of violent agitation "what be this mcneil hear he say in gasping choke voice be this your promise what be the meaning of it?""don't be alarm general do n't be alarm say the little fat factor in soothe fashion as one might speak to frightened child this be young mr. fothergill west of branksome though what bring he up here tonight be more than can understand however as you be to be neighbour ca n't do well than take the opportunity to introduce you to each other mr. west this be general heatherstone who be about to take lease of cloomber hall "i hold out my hand to the tall man who take it in hesitating half reluctant fashion "i come up explain because see your light in the window and think that something might be wrong be very glad do so since it have give i the chance of make the general 's acquaintance "whilst be talk be conscious that the new tenant of cloomber hall be peer at i very closely through the darkness as conclude he stretch out long tremulous arm and turn the gig lamp in such way as to throw flood of light upon my face "good heavens mcneil he cry in the same quiver voice as before the fellow 's as brown as chocolate he be not an englishman you be not an englishman you sir?""i'm scotchman bear and breed say with an inclination to laugh which be only check by my new acquaintance 's obvious terror "a scotchman eh say he with sigh of relief it be all one nowadays you must excuse i mr. mr. west be nervous infernally nervous come along mcneil we must be back in wigtown in less than an hour good night gentleman good night!"the two clamber into their place the factor crack his whip and the high dog cart clatter away through the darkness cast brilliant tunnel of yellow light on either side of it until the rumble of its wheel die away in the distance "what do you think of our new neighbour jamieson ask after long silence "'deed mr. west he seem as he say himsel to be vera nervous maybe his conscience be oot order ""his liver more likely say i. he look as if he have try his constitution bit but it be blow chill seth my lad and it be time both of we be indoor "i bid my companion good night and strike off across the moor for the cheery ruddy light which mark the parlour window of branksome there be as may well be imagine much stir amongst our small community at the news that the hall be to be inhabit once more and considerable speculation as to the new tenant and their object in choose this particular part of the country for their residence it speedily become apparent that whatever their motive might be they have definitely determine upon lengthy stay for relay of plumber and of joiner come down from wigtown and there be hammer and repair go on from morning till night it be surprising how quickly the sign of the wind and weather be efface until the great square set house be all as spick and span as though it have be erect yesterday there be abundant sign that money be no consideration to general heatherstone and that it be not on the score of retrenchment that he have take up his abode among we "it may be that he be devoted to study suggest my father as we discuss the question round the breakfast table perhaps he have choose this seclude spot to finish some magnum opus upon which he be engaged if that be the case should be happy to let he have the run of my library "esther and laugh at the grandiloquent manner in which he speak of the two potato sacksful of book "it may be as you say say but the general do not strike i during our short interview as be man who be likely to have any very pronounced literary taste if might hazard guess should say that he be here upon medical advice in the hope that the complete quiet and fresh air may restore his shatter nervous system if you have see how he glare at i and the twitching of his finger you would have think it need some restoring ""i do wonder whether he have wife and family say my sister poor soul how lonely they will be why except ourselves there be not

father wag his white head with keen appreciation of his own humour it do n't include that under the heading of dare action though it very well might my dear it very well might "all our doubt however upon this head be very soon set at rest for on the very day that the repairing and the furnishing have be complete have occasion to ride into wigtown and meet upon the way carriage which be bear general heatherstone and his family to their new home an elderly lady worn and sickly look be by his side and opposite he sit young fellow about my own age and girl who appear to be couple of year young raise my hat and be about to pass they when the general shout to his coachman to pull up and hold out his hand to i could see now in the daylight that his face although harsh and stern be capable of assume not unkindly expression "how be you mr. fothergill west he cry must apologise to you if be little brusque the other night you will excuse an old soldier who have spend the good part of his life in harness all the same you must confess that you be rather dark skinned for scotchman ""we have spanish strain in our blood say wonder at his recurrence to the topic "that would of course
