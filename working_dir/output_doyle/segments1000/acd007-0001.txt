our friend would find himsel in house with high wall round the ground and that without cost he farthing say the agent "where then ask humour his joke "why in the wigtown county lunatic asylum cry the little man with bubble of laughter in the midst of which ride on my way leave he still chuckle over his own facetiousness the arrival of the new family at cloomber hall have no perceptible effect in relieve the monotony of our secluded district for instead of enter into such simple pleasure as the country have to offer or interesting themselves as we have hope in our attempt to improve the lot of our poor crofter and fisherfolk they seem to shun all observation and hardly ever to venture beyond the avenue gate we soon find too that the factor 's word as to the inclosing of the ground be found

from stand upon the defensive stranger still he have victual the house as if for siege for begbie the chief grocer of wigtown tell i himself in rapture of delight and amazement that the general have send he an order for hundred of dozen of every imaginable potted meat and vegetable it may be imagine that all these unusual incident be not allow to pass without malicious comment over the whole countryside and as far away as the english border there be nothing but gossip about the new tenant of cloomber hall and the reason which have lead they to come among we the only hypothesis however which the bucolic mind could evolve be that which have already occur to mr. mcneil the factor namely that the old general and his family be one and all afflict with madness or as an alternative conclusion that he have commit some heinous offence and be endeavour to escape the consequence of his misdeed these be both natural supposition under the circumstance but neither of they appear to i to commend itself as true explanation of the fact it be true that general heatherstone 's behaviour on the occasion of our first interview be such as to suggest some suspicion of mental disease but no man could have be more reasonable or more courteous than he have afterwards show himself to be then again his wife and child lead the same seclude life that he do himself so that the reason could not be one peculiar to his own health as to the possibility of his be fugitive from justice that theory be even more untenable wigtownshire be bleak and lonely but it be not such an obscure corner of the world that well know soldier could hope to conceal himself there nor would man who fear publicity set every one 's tongue wagging as the general have do on the whole be inclined to believe that the true solution of the enigma lie in his own allusion to the love of quiet and that they have take shelter here with an almost morbid craving for solitude and repose we very soon have an instance of the great length to which this desire for isolation would carry they my father have come down one morning with the weight of great determination upon his brow "you must put on your pink frock to day esther say he and you john you must make yourself smart for have determine that the three of we shall drive round this afternoon and pay our respect to mrs. heatherstone and the general ""a visit to cloomber cry esther clap her hand "i be here say my father with dignity not only as the laird 's factor but also as his kinsman in that capacity be convinced that he would wish i to call upon these

and know by experience that when the old man begin to justify his resolution by quotation from the persian poet there be no chance of shake it sure enough that afternoon see the phaeton at the door with my father perch upon the seat with his second good coat on and pair of new driving glove "jump in my dear he cry crack his whip briskly we shall show the general that he have no cause to be ashamed of his neighbour "alas pride always go before fall our well feed pony and shine harness be not destine that day to impress the tenant of cloomber with sense of our importance we have reach the avenue gate and be about to get out and open it when our attention be arrest by very large wooden placard which be attach to one of the tree in such manner that no one could possibly pass without see it on the white surface of this board be print in big black letter the follow hospitable inscription general and mrs heatherstone have no wish to increase the circle of their acquaintance.we all sat gaze at this announcement for some moment in silent astonishment then esther and tickle by the absurdity of the thing burst out laugh but my father pull the pony head round and drive home with compressed lip and the cloud of much wrath upon his brow have never see the good man so thoroughly move and be convinced that his anger do not arise from any petty feeling of injure vanity upon his own part but from the thought that slight have be offer to the laird of branksome whose dignity he represent if have any personal soreness on account of this family snub it be very pass emotion and one which be soon efface from my mind it chance that on the very next day after the episode have occasion to pass that way and stop to have another look at the obnoxious placard be stand stare at it and wonder what could have induce our neighbour to take such an outrageous step when become suddenly aware of sweet girlish face which peep out at i from between the bar of the gate and of white hand which eagerly beckon i to approach as advance to she see that it be the same young lady whom have see in the carriage "mr west she say in quick whisper glance from side to side as she speak in nervous

for be grieve at her evident distress be sure that your father have some reason unknown to we for take this step ""heaven know he have she answer with ineffable sadness in her voice and yet think it would be more manly to face danger than to fly from it however he know good and it be impossible for we to judge but who be this she exclaim anxiously peer up the dark avenue oh it be my brother mordaunt mordaunt she say as the young man approach we have be apologise to mr. west for what happen yesterday in your name as well as my own ""i be very very glad to have the opportunity of do it in

he would n't half like it if he know it be whim of his that we should keep ourselves entirely to ourselves at least some people would call it whim for my own part have reason to believe that he have solid ground for all that he do though perhaps in this matter he may be little too exacting ""you must surely find it very lonely say i. could n't you manage to slip down at time and have smoke with i that house over yonder be branksome ""indeed you be very kind he answer with sparkle eye should dearly like to run over now and again with the exception of israel stakes our old coachman and gardener have not soul that can speak to ""and your sister she must feel it even more say think in my heart that my new acquaintance make rather too much of his own trouble and too little of those of his companion "yes poor gabriel feel it no doubt he answer carelessly but it be more unnatural thing for young man of my age to be coope up in this way than for woman look at i now be three and twenty next march and yet have never be to university nor to school for that matter be as complete an ignoramus as any of these clodhopper it seem strange to you no doubt and yet it be so now do n't you think deserve well fate?"he stop as he speak and face round to i throw his palm forward in appeal as look at he with the sun shine upon his face he certainly do seem strange bird to be coope up in such cage tall and muscular with keen dark face and sharp finely cut feature he might have step out of canvas of murillo or velasquez there be latent energy and power in his firm set mouth his square eyebrow and the whole pose of his elastic well knit figure "there be the learning to be get from book and the learning to be get from experience say sententiously if you have less of your share of the one perhaps you have more of the other can not believe you have spend all your life in mere idleness and pleasure ""pleasure he cry pleasure look at this he pull off his hat and see that his black hair be all deck and dash with streak of grey do you imagine that this come from pleasure he ask with bitter laugh "you must have have some great shock say astonish at the sight some terrible illness in your youth or perhaps it arise from more chronic cause constant gnawing anxiety have know man as young as you whose hair be as grey ""poor brute he mutter pity they ""if you can manage to slip down to branksome at time say perhaps you could bring miss heatherstone with you know that my father and my sister would be delighted to see she and change if only for an hour or two might do she good ""it would be rather hard for we both to get away together he answer however if see chance shall bring she down it might be manage some afternoon perhaps for the old man indulge in siesta occasionally "we have reach the head of the winding lane which branch off from the high road and lead to the laird 's house so my companion pull up "i must go back he say abruptly or they will miss i it be very kind of you west to take this interest in we be very grateful to you and so will gabriel be when she hear of your kind invitation it be real heaping of coal of fire after that infernal placard of my father's "he shake my hand and set off down the road but he came run after i presently call i to stop "i be just think he say that you must consider we great mystery up there at cloomber dare say you have come to look upon it as private lunatic asylum and ca n't blame you if you be interested in the matter feel it be unfriendly upon my part not to satisfy your curiosity but have promise my father to be silent about it and indeed if be to tell you all that know you might not be very much the wiser after all would have you understand this however that my father be as sane as you or and that he have very good reason for live the life which he do may add that his wish to remain secluded do not arise from any unworthy or dishonourable motive but merely from the instinct of self preservation ""he be in danger then ejaculate "yes he be in constant danger ""but why do he not apply to the magistrate for protection ask if he be afraid of any one he have only to name he and they will bind he over to keep the peace ""my dear west say young heatherstone the danger with which my father be threaten be one that can not be avert by any human intervention it be none the less very real and possibly very imminent ""you do n't mean to assert that it be supernatural say incredulously "well hardly that either he answer with hesitation there he continue have say rather more than should but know that you will not abuse my confidence good bye!"he take to his heel and be soon out of sight round curve in the country road danger which be real and imminent not to be avert by human mean and yet hardly supernatural here be conundrum indeed!i have come to look upon the inhabitant of the hall as mere eccentric but after what young mordaunt heatherstone have just tell i could no long doubt that some dark and sinister meaning underlay all their action the more ponder over the problem the more unanswerable do it appear and yet could not get the matter out of my thought the lonely isolated hall and the strange impending catastrophe which hang over its inmate appeal forcibly to my imagination all that evening and late into the night sit moodily by the fire ponder over what have hear and revolve in my mind the various incident which might furnish i with some clue to the mystery trust that my reader will not set i down as an inquisitive busybody when say that as the day and week go by find my attention and my thought more and more attracted to general heatherstone and the mystery which surround he it be in vain that endeavour by hard work and strict attention to the laird 's affair to direct my mind into some more healthy channel do what would on land or on the water would still find myself puzzle over this one question until it obtain such hold upon i that feel it be useless for i to attempt to apply myself to anything until have come to some satisfactory solution of it could never pass the dark line of five foot fencing and the great iron gate with its massive lock without pause and rack my brain as to what the secret might be which be shut in by that inscrutable barrier yet with all my conjecture and all my observation could never come to any conclusion which could for moment be accept as an explanation of the fact my sister have be out for stroll one night visit sick peasant or perform some other of the numerous act of charity by which she have make herself belove by the whole countryside "john she say when she return have you see cloomber hall at night?""no answer lay down the book which be read not since that memorable evening when the general and mr. mcneil come over to make an inspection ""well john will you put your hat on and come little walk with me?"i could see by her manner that something have agitate or frighten she "why bless the girl cry boisterously what be the matter the old hall be not on fire surely you look as grave as if all wigtown be in blaze ""not quite so bad as that she say smile but do come out jack should very much like you to see it "i have always refrain from say anything which might alarm my sister so that she know nothing of the interest which our neighbour doing have for i at her request take my hat and follow she out into the darkness she lead the way along little footpath over the moor which bring we to some rise ground from which we could look down upon the hall without our view be obstruct by any of the fir tree which have be plant round it "look at that say my sister pause at the summit of this little eminence cloomber lie beneath we in blaze of light in the low floor the shutter obscure the illumination but above from the broad window of the second storey to the thin slit at the summit of the tower there be not chink or an aperture which do not send forth stream of radiance so dazzling be the effect that for moment be persuade that the house be on fire but the steadiness and clearness of the light soon free i from that apprehension it be clearly the result of many lamp place systematically all over the building it add to the strange effect that all these brilliantly illuminate room be apparently untenanted and some of they so far as we could judge be not even furnish through the whole great house there be no sign of movement or of life nothing but the clear unwinke flood of yellow light be still lose in wonder at the sight when hear short quick sob at my side "what be it esther dear ask look down at my companion "i feel so frightened oh john john take i home feel so frightened!"she clung to my arm and pull at my coat in perfect frenzy of fear "it be all safe darling say soothingly there be nothing to fear what have upset you so?""i be afraid of they john be afraid of the heatherstones why be their house light up like this every night have hear from other that it be always so and why do the old man run like frightened hare if any one come upon he there be something wrong about it john and it frighten i "i pacify she as well as could and lead her home with i where take care that she should have some hot port negus before go to bed avoid the subject of the heatherstones for fear of exciting she and she do not recur to it of her own accord be convince however from what have hear from she that she have for some time back be make her own observation upon our neighbour and that in do so she have put considerable strain upon her nerve could see that the mere fact of the hall be illuminate at night be not enough to account for her extreme agitation and that it must have derive its importance in her eye from be one in chain of incident all of which have leave weird or unpleasant impression upon her mind that be the conclusion which come to at the time and have reason to know now that be right and that my sister have even more cause than have myself for believe that there be something uncanny about the tenant of cloomber our interest in the matter may have arise at first from nothing high than curiosity but event soon look turn which associate we more closely with the fortune of the heatherstone family mordaunt have take advantage of my invitation to come down to the laird 's house and on several occasion he bring with he his beautiful sister the four of we would wander over the moor together or perhaps if the day be fine set sail upon our little skiff and stand off into the irish sea on such excursion the brother and sister would be as merry and as happy as two child it be keen pleasure to they to escape from their dull fortress and to see if only for few hour friendly and sympathetic face round they there could be but one result when four young people be bring together in sweet forbid intercourse acquaintance ship warm into friendship and friendship flame suddenly into love gabriel sit beside i now as write and she agree with i that dear as be the subject to ourselves the whole story of our mutual affection be of too personal nature to be more than touch upon in this statement suffice it to say that within few week of our first meeting mordaunt heatherstone have win the heart of my dear sister and gabriel have give i that pledge which death itself will not be able to break have allude in this brief way to the double tie which spring up between the two family because have no wish that this narrative should degenerate into anything approach to romance or that should lose the thread of the fact which have set myself to chronicle these be connect with general heatherstone and only indirectly with my own personal history it be enough if say that after our engagement the visit to branksome become more frequent and that our friend be able sometimes to spend whole day with we when business have call the general to wigtown or when his gout confine he to his room as to our good father he be ever ready to greet we with many small jest and tag of oriental poem appropriate to the occasion for we have no secret from he and he already look upon we all as his child there be time when on account of some peculiarly dark or restless fit of the general 's it be impossible for week on end for either gabriel or mordaunt to get away from the ground the old man would even stand on guard gloomy and silent sentinel at the avenue gate or pace up and down the drive as though he suspect that attempt have be make to penetrate his seclusion pass of an evening have see his dark grim figure flit about in the shadow of the tree or catch glimpse of his hard angular swarthy face peer out suspiciously at i from behind the bar my heart would often sadden for he as notice his uncouth nervous movement his furtive glance and twitch feature who would have believe that this slinking cower creature have once be dash officer who have fight the battle of his country and have win the
