hear an old soldier speak so even in jest say sternly "jest indeed he cry with great roar oath 'd have do it year ago if the rooshians have be game to take it up skobeloff be the good of the bunch but he be be snuff out however that be neither here nor there what want to ask you be whether you 've ever hear anything in this quarter of man call heatherstone the same who use to be colonel of the 41st bengalis they tell i at wigtown that he live somewhere down this way ""he live in that large house over yonder say point to cloomber tower you 'll find the avenue gate little way down the road but the general be n't over fond of visitor "the last part of my speech be lose upon corporal rufus smith for the instant that point out the gate he set off hop down the road his mode of progression be the most singular have ever see for he would only put his right foot to the ground once in every half dozen stride while he work so hard and attain such momentum with the other limb that he get over the ground at an astonishing speed be so surprised that stand in the roadway gaze after this hulking figure until the thought suddenly strike i that some serious result might come from meeting between man of such blunt speech and the choleric hot head general therefore follow he as he hop along like some great clumsy bird and overtook he at the avenue gate where he stand grasp the ironwork and peer through at the dark carriage drive beyond "he be sly old jackal he say look round at i and nod his head in the direction of the hall he be deep old dog and that be his bungalow be it among the trees?""that be his house answer but should advise you to keep more civil tongue in your head if you intend to speak with the general he be not man to stand any nonsense ""right you be he be always hard nut to crack but be n't this he come down the avenue?"i look through the gate and see that it be indeed the general who having either see we or be attract by our voice be hurry down towards we as he advance he would stop from time to time and peer at we through the dark shadow throw by the tree as if he be irresolute whether to come on or no "he be reconnoiter whisper my companion with hoarse chuckle he be afraid and know what he be afraid of he wo n't be catch in trap if he can help it the old un he be about as fly as they make 'em you bet!"then suddenly stand on his tip toe and wave his hand through the bar of the gate he shout at the top of his voice:"come on my gallant commandant come on the coast 's clear and no enemy in sight "this familiar address have the effect of reassure the general for he come right for we though could tell by his heightened colour that his temper be at boiling point "what you here mr. west he say as his eye fall upon i what be it you want and why have you bring this fellow with you?""i have not bring he with i sir answer feel rather disgusted at be make responsible for the presence of the disreputable look vagabond beside i find he on the road here and he desire to be direct to you so show he the way know nothing of he myself ""what do you want with i then the general ask sternly turn to my companion "if you please sir say the ex corporal speak in whine voice and touch his moleskin cap with humility which contrast strangely with the previous rough independence of his bearing be an old gunner in the queen 's service sir and know your name by hear it in india think that maybe you would take i as your groom or gardener or give i any other place as happen to be vacant ""i be sorry that can not do anything for you my man the old soldier answer impressively "then you 'll give i little just to help i on my way sir say the cringe mendicant you wo n't see an old comrade go to the bad for the sake of few rupee be with sale 's brigade in the passes sir and be at the second taking of cabul "general heatherstone look keenly at the supplicant but be silent to his appeal "i be in ghuznee with you when the wall be all shake down by an earthquake and when we find forty thousand afghans within gunshot of we you ask i about it and you 'll see whether be lie or not we go through all this when we be young and now that we be old you be to live in fine bungalow and be to starve by the roadside it do n't seem to i to be fair ""you be an impertinent scoundrel say the general if you have be good soldier you would never need to ask for help shall not give you farthing ""one word more sir cry the tramp for the other be turn away 've be in the tarada pass "the old soldier spring round as if the word have be pistol shot "what what d'ye mean he stammer "i've be in the tarada pass sir and know man there call ghoolab shah "these last be hiss out in an undertone and malicious grin overspread the face of the speaker their effect upon the general be extraordinary he fairly stagger back from the gateway and his yellow countenance blanch to livid mottled grey for moment he be too overcome to speak at last he gasp out:"ghoolab shah who be you who know ghoolab shah?""take another look say the tramp your sight be not as keen as it be forty year ago "the general take long earnest look at the unkempt wanderer in front of he and as he gaze see the light of recognition spring up in his eye "god bless my soul he cry why it be corporal rufus smith ""you've come on it at last say the other chuckle to himself be wonder how long it would be before you know i and first of all just unlock this gate will you it be hard to talk through grating it be too much like ten minute with visitor in the cell "the general whose face still bear evidence of his agitation undo the bolt with nervous tremble finger the recognition of corporal rufus smith have fancy be relief to he and yet he plainly show by his manner that he regard his presence as by no mean an unmixed blessing "why corporal he say as the gate swing open have often wonder whether you be dead or alive but never expect to see you again how have you be all these long years?""how have be the corporal answer gruffly why have be drunk for the most part when draw my money lie it out in liquor and as long as that last get some peace in life when be clean out go upon tramp partly in the hope of pick up the price of dram and partly in order to look for you ""you'll excuse we talk about these private matter west the general say look round at i for be begin to move away do n't leave we you know something of this matter already and may find yourself entirely in the swim with we some of these day "corporal rufus smith look round at i in blank astonishment "in the swim with we he say however do he get there?""voluntarily voluntarily the general explain hurriedly sink his voice he be neighbour of mine and he have volunteer his help in case should ever need it "this explanation seem if anything to increase the big stranger 's surprise "well if that do n't lick cock fighting he exclaim contemplate i with admiration never hear tell of such thing ""and now you have find i corporal smith say the tenant of cloomber what be it that you want of me?""why everything want roof to cover i and clothe to wear and food to eat and above all brandy to drink ""well 'll take you in and do what can for you say the general slowly but look here smith we must have discipline be the general and you be the corporal be the master and you be the man now do n't let i have to remind you of that again "the tramp draw himself up to his full height and raise his right hand with the palm forward in military salute "i can take you on as gardener and get rid of the fellow have get as to brandy you shall have an allowance and no more we be not deep drinker at the hall ""don't you take opium or brandy or nothing yourself sir ask corporal rufus smith "nothing the general say firmly "well all can say be that you 've get more nerve and pluck than shall ever have do n't wonder now at your win that cross in the mutiny if be to go on listening night after night to they thing without ever take drop of something to cheer my heart why it would drive i silly "general heatherstone put his hand up as though afraid that his companion might say too much "i must thank you mr. west he say for having show this man my door would not willingly allow an old comrade however humble to go to the bad and if do not acknowledge his claim more readily it be simply because have my doubt as to whether he be really what he represent himself to be just walk up to the hall corporal and shall follow you in minute ""poor fellow he continue as he watch the newcomer hobble up the avenue in the ungainly manner which have describe he get gun over his foot and it crush the bone but the obstinate fool would not let the doctor take it off remember he now as smart young soldier in afghanistan he and be associate in some queer adventure which may tell you of some day and naturally feel sympathy towards he and would befriend he do he tell you anything about i before came?""not word reply "oh say the general carelessly but with an evident expression of relief think perhaps he might have say something of old time well must go and look after he or the servant will be frightened for he be n't beauty to look at good bye!"with wave of the hand the old man turn away from i and hurry up the drive after this unexpected addition to his household while stroll on round the high black paling peer through every chink between the plank but without see trace either of mordaunt or of his sister have now bring this statement down to the coming of corporal rufus smith which will prove to be the beginning of the

question though they could clack lood eneugh when they have mind weel week pass into month and thing grow waur instead well in the hall the general he get mair nairvous and his leddy mair melancholy every day and yet there wasna any quarrel or bickering between they for when they 've be togither in the breakfast room use often tae gang round and prune the rose tree alongside the window so that couldna help hearin great pairt their conversation though sair against the grain when the young folk be wi they they would speak little but when they have go they would aye talk as if some waefu trial ere aboot to fa upon they though could never gather from their word what it be that they be afeared o' i've hear the general say mair than ance that he wasna fright death or any danger that he could face and have do wi but that it be the lang weary waitin and the uncertainty that have take the strength and the mettle oot he then my leddy would console he and tell he that maybe it wasna as bad as he thocht and that would come richt in the end but her cheery word be clean throw away upon he as tae the young folk ken weel that they didna bide in the groond and that they be awa whenever they get chance wi maister fothergill west tae branksome but the general be too fu his ain trouble tae ken aboot it and it didna seem tae i that it be pairt my duty either as coachman or as gairdner tae mind

change between the folk in eden and the folk in wigtown there be ane thing that havena speak aboot yet but that should be set doon the general didna share his room wi his wife but sleep alane in chamber at the far end the hoose as distant as possible frae every one else this room be aye lockit when he wasna in it and naebody be ever allow tae gang into it he would mak his ain bed and red it up and dust it by himsel but he wouldna so much as allow one we to set fut on the passage that lead tae it at nicht he would walk ower the hoose and he have lamp hang in every room and corner so that no pairt should be dark many be the time frae my room in the garret 've hear his futstep comin and gangin comin and gangin doon one passage and up anither frae midnight till cockcraw it be weary wark to lie listenin tae his clatter and wonderin whether he be clean daft or whether maybe he 'd lairnt pagan and idolatrous trick oot in india and that his conscience noo be like the worm which gnaweth and dieth not 'd ha speere frae he whether it wouldna ease he to speak wi the holy donald mcsnaw but it might ha be mistake and the general wasna man that you 'd care tae mak mistake wi' ane day be workin at the grass border when he come up and he say say he:"did ye ever have occasion tae fire pistol israel?""godsake say never have siccan thing in my hond in my life ""then you 'd well not begin
