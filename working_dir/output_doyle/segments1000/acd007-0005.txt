on one side of the pass which he have point out this be the scene of some fight in which you be engaged ""yes we have skirmish there he answer lean forward and look at the red mark we be attack by at this moment he fall back upon his pillow as if he have be shoot while the same look of horror come over his face which have observe when first enter the room at the same instant there come apparently from the air immediately above his bed sharp ring tinkle sound which can only compare with the noise make by bicycle alarm though it differ from this in have distinctly throbbing character have never before or since hear any sound which could be confound with it stare round in astonishment wonder where it could have come from but without perceive anything to which it could be ascribe "it be all right doctor the general say with ghastly smile it be only my private gong perhaps you have well step downstairs and write my prescription in the dining room "he be evidently anxious to get rid of i so be force to take my departure though would gladly have stay little long in the hope of learn something as to the origin of the mysterious sound drive away from the house with the full determination of call again upon my interesting patient and endeavour to elicit some further particular as to his past life and his present circumstance be destine however to be disappoint for receive that very evening note from the general himself enclose handsome fee for my single visit and inform i that my treatment have do he so much good that he consider himself to be convalescent and would not trouble i to see he again this be the last and only communication which ever receive from the tenant of cloomber have be ask frequently by neighbour and other who be interested in the matter whether he give i the impression of insanity to this must unhesitatingly answer in the negative on the contrary his remark give i the idea of man who have both read and think deeply observe however during our single interview that his reflex be feeble his arcus senili well marked and his artery atheromatous all sign that his constitution be in an unsatisfactory condition and that sudden crisis might be apprehend having throw this side light upon my narrative can now resume the statement of my own personal experience these have bring down as the reader will doubtless remember to the date of the arrival of the savage look wanderer who call himself corporal rufus smith this incident occur about the beginning of the month of october and find upon comparison of date that dr. easterling 's visit to cloomber precede it by three week or more during all this time be in sore distress of mind for have never see anything either of gabriel or of her brother since the interview in which the general have discover the communication which be keep up between we have no doubt that some sort of restraint have be place upon they and the thought that we have bring trouble on their head be bitter one both to my sister and myself our anxiety however be considerably mitigate by the receipt couple of day after my last talk with the general of note from mordaunt heatherstone this be bring we by little ragged urchin the son of one of the fisherman who inform we that it have be hand to he at the avenue gate by an old woman who expect must have be the cloomber cook "my dearest friend it run gabriel and have grieve to think how concerned you must be at have neither hear from nor see we the fact be that we be compel to remain in the house and this compulsion be not physical but moral "our poor father who get more and more nervous every day have entreat we to promise he that we will not go out until after the fifth of october and to allay his fear we have give he the desire pledge on the other hand he have promise we that after the fifth that is in less than week we shall be as free as air to come or go as we please so we have something to look forward to "gabriel say that she have explain to you that the governor be always changed man after this particular date on which his fear reach crisis he apparently have more reason than usual this year to anticipate that trouble be brew for this unfortunate family for have never know he to take so many elaborate precaution or appear so thoroughly unnerved who would ever think to see his bent form and his shake hand that he be the same man who use some few short year ago to shoot tiger on foot among the jungle of the terai and would laugh at the more timid sportsman who seek the protection of their elephant 's howdah?"you know that he have the victoria cross which he win in the street of delhi and yet here he be shiver with terror and start at every noise in the most peaceful corner of the world oh the pity of it west remember what have already tell you that it be no fanciful or imaginary peril but one which we have every reason to suppose to be most real it be however of such nature that it can neither be avert nor can it profitably be express in word if all go well you will see we at branksome on the sixth "with our fond love to both of you be ever my dear friend your attached"mordaunt."this letter be great relief to we as let we know that the brother and sister be under no physical restraint but our powerlessness and inability even to comprehend what the danger be which threaten those whom we have come to love well than ourselves be little short of maddening fifty time day we ask ourselves and ask each other from what possible quarter this peril be to be expect but the more we think of it the more hopeless do any solution appear in vain we combine our experience and piece together every word which have fall from the lip of any inmate of cloomber which might be suppose to bear directly or indirectly upon the subject at last weary with fruitless speculation we be fain to try to drive the matter from our thought console ourselves with the reflection that in few more day all restriction would be remove and we should be able to learn from our friend own lip those few intervene day however would we fear be dreary long one and so they would have be have it not be for new and most unexpected incident which divert our mind from our own trouble and give they something fresh with which to occupy themselves the third of october have break auspiciously with bright sun and cloudless sky there have in the morning be slight breeze and few little white wreath of vapour drift here and there like the scatter feather of some gigantic bird but as the day wear on such wind as there be fall completely away and the air become close and stagnant the sun blaze down with degree of heat which be remarkable so late in the season and shimmering haze lie upon the upland moor and conceal the irish mountain on the other side of the channel the sea itself rise and fall in long heavy oily roll sweep slowly landward and break sullenly with dull monotonous booming upon the rock girt shore to the inexperienced all seem calm and peaceful but to those who be accustomed to read nature 's warning there be dark menace in air and sky and sea my sister and walk out in the afternoon saunter slowly along the margin of the great sandy spit which shoot out into the irish sea flank upon one side the magnificent bay of luce and on the other the more obscure inlet of kirkmaiden on the shore of which the branksome property be situate it be too sultry to go far so we soon seat ourselves upon one of the sandy hillock overgrown with faded grass tuft which extend along the coast line and which form nature 's dyke against the encroachment of the ocean our rest be soon interrupt by the scrunching of heavy boot upon the shingle and jamieson the old man o'-war 's man whom have already have occasion to mention make his appearance with the flat circular net upon his back which he use for shrimp catch he come towards we upon see we and say in his rough kindly way that he hope we would not take it amiss if he send we up dish of shrimp for our tea at branksome "i aye make good catch before storm he remark "you think there be go to be storm then ask "why even marine could see that he answer stick great wedge of tobacco into his cheek the moor over near cloomber be just white wi gull and kittiewake what d'ye think they come ashore for except to escape have all the feather blow out they mind day like this when be wi charlie napier off cronstadt it well nigh blow we under the gun of the fort for all our engine and propeller ""have you ever know wreck in these part ask "lord love ye sir it be famous place for wreck why in that very bay down there two king philip 's first rate founder wi all hand in the day the spanish war if that sheet water and the bay luce round the corner could tell their ain tale they 'd have gey lot to speak of when the jedgment day come round that water will be just bubble wi the number folk that will be come up frae the bottom ""i trust that there will be no wreck while we be here say esther earnestly the old man shake his grizzle head and look distrustfully at the hazy horizon "if it blow from the west he say some these sailing ship may find it no joke to be catch without sea room in the north channel there be that barque out yonder daresay her maister would be glad enough to find himsel safe in the clyde ""she seem to be absolutely motionless remark look at the vessel in question whose black hull and gleaming sail rise and fall slowly with the throbbing of the giant pulse beneath she perhaps jamieson we be wrong and there will be no storm after all "the old sailor chuckle to himself with an air of superior knowledge and shuffle away with his shrimp net while my sister and walk slowly homeward through the hot and stagnant air go up to my father 's study to see if the old gentleman have any instruction as to the estate for he have become engross in new work upon oriental literature and the practical management of the property have in consequence devolve entirely upon i find he seat at his square library table which be so heaped with book and paper that nothing of he be visible from the door except tuft of white hair "my dear son he say to i as enter it be great grief to i that you be not more conversant with sanscrit when be your age could converse not only in that noble language but also in the tamulic lohitic gangelic taic and malaic dialect which be all offshoot from the turanian branch ""i regret extremely sir answer that have not inherit your wonderful talent as polyglot ""i have set myself task he explain which if it could only be continue from generation to generation in our own family until it be complete would make the name of west immortal this be nothing less than to publish an english translation of the buddhist djarmas with preface give an idea of the position of brahminism before the coming of sakyamuni with diligence it be possible that might be able myself to complete part of the preface before die ""and pray sir ask how long would the whole work be when it be finished?""the abridge edition in the imperial library of pekin say my father rub his hand together consist of 325 volume of an average weight of five pound then the preface which must embrace some account of the rig veda the sama veda the yagur veda and the atharva veda with the brahmanas could hardly be complete in less than ten volume now if we apportion one volume to each year there be every prospect of the family come to an end of its task about the date 2250 the twelfth generation complete the work while the thirteenth might occupy itself upon the index ""and how be our descendant to live sir ask with smile during the progress of this great undertaking:""that be the bad of you jack my father cry petulantly there be nothing practical about you instead of confine your attention to the working out of my noble scheme you begin raise all sort of absurd objection it be mere matter of detail how our descendant live so long as they stick to the djarmas now want you to go up to the bothy of fergus mcdonald and see about the thatch and willie fullerton have write to say that his milk cow be bad you might take in upon your way and ask after it "i start off upon my errand but before do so take look at the barometer upon the wall the mercury have sink to the phenomenal point of twenty eight inch clearly the old sailor have not be wrong in his interpretation of nature 's sign as return over the moor in the evening the wind be blow in short angry puff and the western horizon be heap with sombre cloud which stretch their long ragged tentacle right up to the zenith against their dark background one or two livid sulphur colour splotch show up malignant and menacing while the surface of the sea have change from the appearance of burnish quicksilver to that of ground glass low moan sound rise up from the ocean as if it know that trouble be in store for it far out in the channel see single panting eager steam vessel make its way to belfast lough and the large barque which have observe in the morning still beat about in the offing endeavour to pass to the northward at nine o'clock sharp breeze be blow at ten it have freshen into gale and before midnight the most furious storm be rage which can remember upon that weather beat coast sit for some time in our small oak panel sitting room listen to the screeching and howling of the blast and to the rattle of the gravel and pebble as they patter against the window nature 's grim orchestra be play its world old piece with compass which range from the deep diapason of the thunder surge to the thin shriek of the scatter shingle and the keen piping of frightened sea bird once for an instant open the lattice window but gust of wind and rain came bluster through bear with it great sheet of seaweed which flap down upon the table it be all could do to close it again with thrust of my shoulder in the face of the blast my sister and father have retire to their room but my thought be too active for sleep so continue to sit and to smoke by the smoulder fire what be go on in the hall now wonder what do gabriel think of the storm and how do it affect the old man who wander about in the night do he welcome these dread force of nature as be of the same order of thing as his own tumultuous thoughts?it be only two day now from the date which have be assure be to mark crisis in his fortune would he regard this sudden tempest as be in any way connect with the mysterious fate which threaten him?over all these thing and many more ponder as sit by the glow ember until they die gradually out and the chill night air warn i that it be time to retire may have sleep couple of hour when be awaken by someone tug furiously at my shoulder sit up in bed see by the dim light that my father be stand half clothe by my bedside and that it be his grasp which feel on my night shirt "get up jack get up he be cry excitedly there be great ship ashore in the bay and the poor folk will all be drown come down my boy and let we see what we can do "the good old man seem to be nearly beside himself with excitement and impatience spring from my bed and be huddle on few clothe when dull booming sound make itself hear above the howling of the wind and the thunder of the breaker "there it be again cry my father it be their signal gun poor creature jamieson and the fisherman be below put your oil skin coat on and the glengarry hat come come every second may mean human life!"we hurry down together and make our way to the beach accompany by dozen or so of the inhabitant of branksome the gale have increase rather than moderate and the wind scream all round we with an infernal clamour so great be its force that we have to put our shoulder against it and bear our way through it while the sand and gravel tingle up against our face there be just light enough to make out the scud cloud and the white gleam of the breaker but beyond that all be absolute darkness we stand ankle deep in the shingle and seaweed shade our eye with our hand and peer out into the inky obscurity it seem to i as listen that could hear human voice loud in intreaty and terror but amid the wild turmoil of nature it be difficult to distinguish one sound from another suddenly however light glimmer in the heart of the temp and next instant the beach and sea and wide toss bay be brilliantly illuminate by the wild glare of signal light the ship lie on her beam end right in the centre of the terrible hansel reef hurl over to such an angle that could see all the planking of her deck recognise she at once as be the same three masted barque which have observe in the channel in the morning and the union jack which be nail upside down to the jagged slump of her mizzen proclaim her nationality every spar and rope and writhe piece of cordage show up hard and clear under the vivid light which splutter and flicker from the high portion of the forecastle beyond the doom ship out of the great darkness come the long rolling line of big wave never end never tiring with petulant tuft of foam here and there upon their crest each as it reach the broad circle of unnatural light appear to gather strength and volume and to hurry on more impetuously until with roar and jarring crash it spring upon its victim cling to the weather shrouds we could distinctly see ten or dozen frightened seaman who when the light reveal our presence turn their white face towards we and wave their hand imploringly the poor wretch have evidently take fresh hope from our presence though it be clear that their own boat have either be wash away or so damage as to render they useless the sailor who clung to the rigging be not however the only unfortunate on board on the break poop there stand three man who appear to be both of different race and nature from the cowering wretch who implore our assistance lean upon the shatter taff rail they seem to be converse together as quietly and unconcernedly as though they be unconscious of the deadly peril which surround they as the signal light flicker over they we could see from the shore that these immutable stranger wear red fez and that their face be of swarthy large featured type which proclaim an eastern origin there be little time however for we to take note of such detail the ship be break rapidly and some effort must be make to save the poor sodden group of humanity who implore our assistance the near lifeboat be in the bay of luce ten long mile away but here be our own broad roomy craft upon the shingle and plenty of brave fisher lad to form crew six of we spring to the oar the other push we off and we fight our way through the swirling rage water staggering and recoil before the great sweeping billow but still steadily decrease the distance between the barque and ourselves it seem however that our effort be fate to be in vain as we mount upon surge see giant wave top all the other and come after they like driver follow flock sweep down upon the vessel curl its great green arch over the break deck with rending rive sound the ship split in two where the terrible serrate back of the hansel reef be saw into her keel the after part with the broken mizzen and the three orientals sink backwards into deep water and vanish while the fore half oscillate helplessly about retain its precarious balance upon the rock wail of fear go up from the wreck and be echo from the beach but by the blessing of providence she keep afloat until we make our way under she bowsprit and rescue every man of the crew we have not get half way upon our return however when another great wave sweep the shatter forecastle off the reef and extinguish the signal light hide the wild denouement from our view our friend upon the shore be loud in congratulation and praise nor be they backward in welcome and comfort the castaway they be thirteen in all as cold and cow set of mortal as ever slip through death 's finger save indeed their captain who be hardy robust man and who make light of the affair some be take off to this cottage and some to that but the great part come back to branksome with we where we give they such dry clothe as we could lay our hand on and serve they with beef and beer by the kitchen fire the captain whose name be meadows compress his bulky form into suit of my own and come down to the parlour where he mix himself some grog and give my father and myself an account of the disaster "if it have n't be for you sir and your brave fellow he say smile across at i we should be ten fathom deep by this time as to thebelinda she be leaky old tub and well insured so neither the owner nor be likely to break our heart over she ""i be afraid say my father sadly that we shall never see your three passenger again have leave man upon the beach in case they should be wash up but fear it be hopeless see they go down when the vessel split and no man could have live for moment among that terrible surge ""who be they ask could not have believe that it be possible for man to appear so unconcerned in the face of such imminent peril ""as to who they be or be the captain answer puff thoughtfully at his pipe that be by no mean easy to say our last port be kurrachee in the north of india and there we take they aboard as passenger for glasgow ram singh be the name of the young and it be only with he that have come in contact but they all appear to be quiet inoffensive gentleman never inquire their business but should judge that they be parsee merchant from hyderabad whose trade take they to europe could never see why the crew should fear they and the mate too he should have have more sense ""fear they ejaculate in surprise "yes they have some preposterous idea that they be dangerous shipmate have no doubt if you be to go down into the kitchen now you would find that they be all agree that our passenger be the cause of the whole
