and our friend shall judge for themselves whether these poor fellow should be send about their business or not "i make the promise to allay my sister 's apprehension but in the bright sunlight of morning it appear less than absurd to imagine that our poor vegetarian castaway could have any sinister intention or that their advent could have any effect upon the tenant of cloomber be anxious myself however to see whether could see anything of the heatherstones so after breakfast walk up to the hall in their seclusion it be impossible for they to have learn anything of the recent event feel therefore that even if should meet the general he could hardly regard i as an intruder while have so much news to communicate the place have the same dreary and melancholy appearance which always characterise it look through between the thick iron bar of the main gateway there be nothing to be see of any of the occupant one of the great scotch fir have be blow down in the gale and its long ruddy trunk lie right across the grass grow avenue but no attempt have be make to remove it everything about the property have the same air of desolation and neglect with the solitary exception of the massive and impenetrable fencing which present as unbroken and formidable an obstacle as ever to the would be trespass walk round this barrier as far as our old trysting place without find any flaw through which could get glimpse of the house for the fence have be repair with each rail overlap the last so as to secure absolute privacy for those inside and to block those peep hole which have formerly use at the old spot however where have have the memorable interview with the general on the occasion when he surprise i with his daughter find that the two loose rail have be refixe in such manner that there be gap of two inch or more between they through this have view of the house and of part of the lawn in front of it and though could see no sign of life outside or at any of the window settle down with the intention of stick to my post until have chance of speak to one or other of the inmate indeed the cold dead aspect of the house have strike such chill into my heart that determine to scale the fence at whatever risk of incur the general 's displeasure rather than return without news of the heatherstones happily there be no need of this extreme expedient for have not be there half an hour before hear the harsh sound of an opening lock and the general himself emerge from the main door to my surprise he be dress in military uniform and that not the uniform in ordinary use in the british army the red coat be strangely cut and stain with the weather the trouser have originally be white but have now fade to dirty yellow with red sash across his chest and straight sword hang from his side he stand the live example of bygone type the john company 's officer of forty year ago he be follow by the ex tramp corporal rufus smith now well clothe and prosperous who limp along beside his master the two pace up and down the lawn absorb in conversation observe that from time to time one or other of they would pause and glance furtively all about they as though guard keenly against surprise should have prefer communicating with the general alone but since there be no dissociate he from his companion beat loudly on the fencing with my stick to attract their attention they both face round in moment and could see from their gesture that they be disturb and alarmed then elevate my stick above the barrier to show they where the sound proceed from at this the general begin to walk in my direction with the air of man who be brace himself up for an effort but the other catch he by the wrist and endeavour to dissuade he it be only when shout out my name and assure they that be alone that could prevail upon they to approach once assure of my identity the general run eagerly towards i and greet i with the utmost cordiality "this be truly kind of you west he say it be only at such time as these that one can judge who be friend and who not it would not be fair to you to ask you to come inside or to stay any time but be none the less very glad to see you ""i have be anxious about you all say for it be some little time since have see or hear from any of you how have you all be keeping?""why as well as could be expect but we will be well tomorrow we will be different man to morrow eh corporal?""yes sir say the corporal raise his hand to his forehead in military salute we 'll be right as the bank to morrow ""the corporal and be little disturb in our mind just now the general explain but have no doubt that all will come right after all there be nothing high than providence and we be all in his hand and how have you be eh?""we have be very busy for one thing say i. suppose you have hear nothing of the great shipwreck?""not word the general answer listlessly "i think the noise of the wind would prevent you hear the signal gun she come ashore in the bay the night before last great barque from india ""from india ejaculate the general "yes her crew be save fortunately and have all be send on to glasgow ""all send on cry the general with face as bloodless as corpse "all except three rather strange character who claim to be buddhist priest they have decide to remain for few day upon the coast "the word be hardly out of my mouth when the general drop upon his knee with his long thin arm extend to heaven "thy will be do he cry in cracking voice thy bless will be done!"i could see through the crack that corporal rufus smith 's face have turn to sickly yellow shade and that he be wipe the perspiration from his brow "it be like my luck he say after all these year to come when have get snug billet ""never mind my lad the general say rise and square his shoulder like man who brace himself up for an effort be it what it may we 'll face it as british soldier should d'ye remember at chillianwallah when you have to run from your gun to our square and the sikh horse come thunder down on our bayonet we do n't flinch then and we wo n't flinch now it seem to i that feel well than have do for year it be the uncertainty that be kill i ""and the infernal jingle jangle say the corporal well we all go together that be some consolation ""good bye west say the general be good husband to gabriel and give my poor wife home do n't think she will trouble you long good bye god bless you!""look here general say peremptorily break off piece of wood to make communication more easy this sort of thing have be go on too long what be these hint and allusion and innuendo it be time we have little plain speak what be it you fear out with it be you in dread of these hindoos if you be be able on my father 's authority to have they arrest as rogue and vagabond ""no no that would never do he answer shake his head you will learn about the wretched business soon enough mordaunt know where to lay his hand upon the paper bear on the matter you can consult he about it to morrow ""but surely cry if the peril be so imminent something may be do to avert it if you would but tell i what you fear should know how to act ""my dear friend he say there be nothing to be do so calm yourself and let thing take their course it have be folly on my part to shelter myself behind mere barrier of wood and stone the fact be that inaction be terrible to i and feel that to do anything however futile in the nature of precaution be well than passive resignation my humble friend here and have place ourselves in position in which trust no poor fellow will ever find himself again we can only recommend ourselves to the unfailing goodness of the almighty and trust that what we have endure in this world may lessen our atonement in the world to come must leave you now for have many paper to destroy and much to arrange good bye!"he push his hand through the hole which have make and grasp mine in solemn farewell after which he walk back to the hall with firm and decide step still follow by the crippled and sinister corporal walk back to branksome much disturb by this interview and extremely puzzle as to what course should pursue it be evident now that my sister 's suspicion be correct and that there be some very intimate connection between the presence of the three orientals and the mysterious peril which hang over the tower of cloomber it be difficult for i to associate the noble face ram singh 's gentle refined manner and word of wisdom with any deed of violence yet now that think of it could see that terrible capacity for wrath lie behind his shaggy brow and dark pierce eye feel that of all man whom have ever meet he be the one whose displeasure should least care to face but how could two man so widely dissociate as the foul mouthed old corporal of artillery and the distinguished anglo indian general have each earn the ill will of these strange castaway and if the danger be positive physical one why should he not consent to my proposal to have the three man place under custody though confess it would have go much against my grain to act in so inhospitable manner upon such vague and shadowy ground these question be absolutely unanswerable and yet the solemn word and the terrible gravity which have see in the face of both the old soldier forbid i from think that their fear be entirely unfounded it be all puzzle an absolutely insoluble puzzle one thing at least be clear to i and that be that in the present state of my knowledge and after the general 's distinct prohibition it be impossible for i to interfere in any way could only wait and pray that whatever the danger might be it might pass over or at least that my dear gabriel and her brother might be protect against it be walk down the lane lose in thought and have get as far as the wicket gate which open upon the branksome lawn when be surprised to hear my father 's voice raise in most animated and excited converse the old man have be of late so abstracted from the daily affair of the world and so absorb in his own special study that it be difficult to engage his attention upon any ordinary mundane topic curious to know what it be that have draw he so far out of himself open the gate softly and walk quietly round the laurel bush find he sit to my astonishment with none other than the very man who be occupy my thought ram singh the buddhist the two be sit upon garden bench and the oriental appear to be lay down some weighty proposition check every point upon his long quiver brown finger while my father with his hand throw abroad and his face awry be loud in protestation and in argument so absorb be they in their controversy that stand within hand touch of they for minute or more before they become conscious of my presence on observe i the priest spring to his foot and greet i with the same lofty courtesy and dignified grace which have so impress i the day before "i promise myself yesterday he say the pleasure of call upon your father you see have keep my word have even be dare enough to question his view upon some point in connection with the sanscrit and hindoo tongue with the result that we have be argue for an hour or more without either of we convince the other without pretend to as deep theoretical knowledge as that which have make the name of james hunter west household word among oriental scholar happen to have give considerable attention to this one point and indeed be in position to say that know his view to be unsound assure you sir that up to the year 700 or even later sanscrit be the ordinary language of the great bulk of the inhabitant of india ""and assure you sir say my father warmly that it be dead and forget at that date save by the learned who use it as vehicle for scientific and religious work just as latin be use in the middle ages long after it have cease to be speak by any european nation ""if you consult the puranas you will find say ram singh that this theory though commonly receive be entirely untenable ""and if you will consult the ramayana and more particularly the canonical book on buddhist discipline cry my father you will find that the theory be unassailable ""but look at the kullavagga say our visitor earnestly "and look at king asoka shout my father triumphantly when in the year 300 before the christian era before mind you he order the law of buddha to be engrave upon the rock what language do he employ eh be it sanscrit no and why be it not sanscrit because the low order of his subject would not have be able to understand word of it ha ha that be the reason how be you go to get round king asoka 's edict eh?""he carve they in the various dialect ram singh answer but energy be too precious thing to be waste in mere wind in this style the sun have pass its meridian and must return to my companion ""i be sorry that you have not bring they to see we say my father courteously he be could see uneasy lest in the eagerness of debate he have overstep the bound of hospitality "they do not mix with the world ram singh answer rise to his foot they be of high grade than and more sensitive to contaminating influence they be immerse in six month meditation upon the mystery of the third incarnation which have last with few intermission from the time that we leave the himalayas shall not see you again mr. hunter west and therefore bid you farewell your old age will be happy one as it deserve to be and your eastern study will have last effect upon the knowledge and literature of your own country farewell!""and be also to see no more of you ask "unless you will walk with i along the sea shore he answer but you have already be out this morning and may be tired ask too much of you ""nay should be delighted to come respond from my heart and we set off together accompany for some little distance by my father who would gladly could see have reopen the sanscrit controversy have not his stock of breath be too limited to allow of his talking and walk at the same time "he be learn man ram singh remark after we have leave he behind but like many another he be intolerant towards opinion which differ from his own he will know well some day "i make no answer to this observation and we trudge along for time in silence keep well down to the water 's edge where the sand afford good foothold the sand dune which line the coast form continuous ridge upon our left cut we off entirely from all human observation while on the right the broad channel stretch away with hardly sail to break its silvery uniformity the buddhist priest and be absolutely alone with nature could not help reflect that if he be really the dangerous man that the mate affect to consider he or that might be infer from the word of general heatherstone have place myself completely in his power yet such be the majestic benignity of the man 's aspect and the unruffled serenity of his deep dark eye that could afford in his presence to let fear and suspicion blow past i as lightly as the breeze which whistle round we his face might be stern and even terrible but feel that he could never be unjust as glance from time to time at his noble profile and the sweep of his jet black beard his rough spin tweed travel suit strike i with an almost painful sense of incongruity and re clothe he in my imagination with the grand sweeping oriental costume which be the fitting and proper frame for such picture the only garb which do not detract from the dignity and grace of the wearer the place to which he lead i be small fisher cottage which have be desert some year before by its tenant but still stand gaunt and bare with the thatch partly blow away and the window and door in sad disrepair this dwelling which the poor scotch beggar would have shrink from be the one which these singular man have prefer to the proffer hospitality of the laird 's house small garden now mass of tangled bramble stand round it and through this my acquaintance pick his way to the ruin door he glance into the house and then wave his hand for i to follow he "you have now an opportunity he say in subdue reverential voice of see spectacle which few europeans have have the privilege of beholding inside that cottage you will find two yogis man who be only one remove from the high plane of adeptship they be both wrap in an ecstatic trance otherwise should not venture to obtrude your presence upon they their astral body have depart from they to be present at the feast of lamp in the holy lamasery of rudok in tibet tread lightly lest by stimulate their corporeal function you recall they before their devotion be complete "walking slowly and on tiptoe pick my way through the weed grow garden and peer through the open doorway there be no furniture in the dreary interior nor anything to cover the uneven floor save litter of fresh straw in corner among this straw two man be crouch the one small and wizene the other large boned and gaunt with their leg cross in oriental fashion and their head sink upon their breast neither of they look up or take the small notice of our presence they be so still and silent that they might have be two bronze statue but for the slow and measured rhythm of their breathing their face however have peculiar ashen grey colour very different from the healthy brown of my companion 's and observe on stoop my head that only the white of their eye be visible the ball be turn upwards beneath the lid in front of they upon small mat lie an earthenware pitcher of water and half loaf of bread together with sheet of paper inscribe with certain cabalistic character ram singh glance at these and then motion to i to withdraw follow i out into the garden "i be not to disturb they until ten o'clock he say you have now see in operation one of the grand result of our occult philosophy the dissociation of spirit from body not only be the spirit of these holy man stand at the present moment by the bank of the ganges but those spirit be clothe in material cover so identical with their real body that none of the faithful will ever doubt that lal hoomi and mowdar khan be actually among they this be accomplish by our power of resolve an object into its chemical atom of convey these atom with speed which exceed that of lightning to any give spot and of there re precipitate they and compel they to retake their original form of old in the day of our ignorance it be necessary to convey the whole body in this way but we have since find that it be as easy and more convenient to transmit material enough merely to build up an outside shell or semblance this we have term the astral body ""but if you can transmit your spirit so readily observe why should they be accompany by any body at all?""in communicate with brother initiate we be able to employ our spirit only but when we wish to come in contact with ordinary mankind it be essential that we should appear in some form which they can see and comprehend ""you have interest i deeply in all that you have tell i say grasp the hand which ram singh have hold out to i as sign that our interview be at an end shall often think of our short acquaintance ""you will derive much benefit from it he say slowly still hold my hand and look gravely and sadly into my eye you must remember that what will happen in the future be not necessarily bad because it do not fall in with your preconceived idea of right be not hasty in your judgment there be certain great rule which must be carry out at whatever cost to individual their operation may appear to you to be harsh and cruel but that be as nothing compare with the dangerous precedent which would be establish by not enforce they the ox and the sheep be safe from we but the man with the blood of the high upon his hand should not and shall not live "he throw up his arm at the last word with fierce threaten gesture and turn away from i strode back to the ruin hut stand gaze after he until he disappear through the doorway and then start off for home revolve in my mind all that have hear and more particularly this last outburst of the occult philosopher far on the right could see the tall white tower of cloomber stand out clear cut and sharp against dark cloud bank which rise behind it think how any traveller who chance to pass that way would envy in his heart the tenant of that magnificent building and how little they would guess the strange terror the nameless danger which be gather about his head the black cloud wrack be but the image reflect of the dark more sombre storm which be about to burst "whatever it all mean and however it happen ejaculate god grant that the innocent be not confound with the guilty "my father when reach home be still in ferment over his learn disputation with the stranger "i trust jack he say that do not handle he too roughly should remember that amin loco magistri and be less prone to argue with my guest yet when he take up this most untenable position could not refrain from attack he and hurl he out of it which indeed do though you who be ignorant of the nicety of the question may have fail to perceive it you observe however that my reference to king asoka 's edict be so conclusive that he at once rise and take his leave ""you hold your own bravely answer but what be your impression of the man now that you have see him?""why say my father he be one of those holy man who under the various name of sannasis yogis sevras qualanders hakims and cufis have devote their life to the study of the mystery of the buddhist faith he be take it theosophist or worshipper of the god of knowledge the high grade of which be the adept this man and his companion have not attain this high position or they could not have cross the sea without contamination it be probable that they be all advanced chela who hope in time to attain to the supreme honour of adeptship ""but father interrupt my sister this do not explain why man of such sanctity and attainment should choose to take up their quarter on the shore of desolate scotch bay ""ah there you get beyond i my father answer may suggest however that it be nobody 's business but their own so long as they keep the peace and be amenable to the law of the land ""have
