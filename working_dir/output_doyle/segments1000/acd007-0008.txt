you ever hear ask that these high priest of whom you speak have power which be unknown to us?""why eastern literature be full of it the bible be an eastern book and be it not full of the record of such power from cover to cover it be unquestionable that they have in the past know many of nature 's secret which be lose to we can not say however from my own knowledge that the modern theosophist really possess the power that they claim ""are they vindictive class of people ask be there any offence among they which can only be expiate by death?""not that know of my father answer raise his white eyebrow in surprise you appear to be in an inquisitive humour this afternoon what be the object of all these question have our eastern neighbour arouse your curiosity or suspicion in any way?"i parry the question as well might for be unwilling to let the old man know what be in my mind no good purpose could come from his enlightenment his age and his health demand rest rather than anxiety and indeed with the good will in the world should have find it difficult to explain to another what be so very obscure to myself for every reason feel that it be good that he should be keep in the dark never in all my experience have know day pass so slowly as do that eventful 5th of october in every possible manner endeavour to while away the tedious hour and yet it seem as if darkness would never arrive try to read try to write pace about the lawn walk to the end of the lane put new fly upon my fishing hook begin to index my father 's library in dozen way endeavour to relieve the suspense which be become intolerable my sister could see be suffer from the same feverish restlessness again and again our good father remonstrate with we in his mild way for our erratic behaviour and the continual interruption of his work which arise from it at last however the tea be bring and the tea be take the curtain be draw the lamp light and after another interminable interval the prayer be read and the servant dismiss to their room my father compound and swallow his nightly jorum of toddy and then shuffle off to his room leave the two of we in the parlour with our nerve in tingle and our mind full of the most vague and yet terrible apprehension it be quarter past ten o'clock by the parlour timepiece when my father go off to his room and leave esther and myself together we hear his slow step die away up the creaking staircase until the distant slamming of door announce that he have reach his sanctum the simple oil lamp upon the table throw weird uncertain light over the old room flicker upon the carve oak panelling and cast strange fantastic shadow from the high elbow straight back furniture my sister 's white anxious face stand out in the obscurity with startling exactness of profile like one of rembrandt 's portrait we sit opposite to each other on either side of the table with no sound break the silence save the measured ticking of the clock and the intermittent chirping of cricket beneath the grate there be something awe inspiring in the absolute stillness the whistling of belated peasant upon the high road be relief to we and we strain our ear to catch the last of his note as he plod steadily homeward at first we have make some pretence she of knitting and of read but we soon abandon the useless deception and sit uneasily wait start and glance at each other with question eye whenever the faggot crackle in the fire or rat scamper behind the wainscot there be heavy electrical feeling in the air which weigh we down with foreboding of disaster rise and fling the hall door open to admit the fresh breeze of the night ragged cloud sweep across the sky and the moon peep out at time between their hurrying fringe bathe the whole countryside in its cold white radiance from where stand in the doorway could see the edge of the cloomber wood though the house itself be only visible from the rise ground some little distance off at my sister 's suggestion we walk together she with her shawl over her head as far as the summit of this elevation and look out in the direction of the hall there be no illumination of the window tonight from roof to basement not light twinkle in any part of the great building its huge mass loom up dark and sullen amid the tree which surround it look more like some giant sarcophagus than human habitation to our overwrought nerve there be something of terror in its mere bulk and its silence we stand for some little time peer at it through the darkness and then we make our way back to the parlour again where we sit wait wait we know not for what and yet with absolute conviction that some terrible experience be in store for we it be twelve o'clock or thereabout when my sister suddenly spring to her foot and hold up her finger to bespeak attention "do you hear nothing she ask strain my ear but without success "come to the door she cry with tremble voice now can you hear anything?"in the deep silence of the night distinctly hear dull murmuring clattering sound continuous apparently but very faint and low "what be it ask in subdue voice "it be the sound of man run towards we she answer and then suddenly drop the last semblance of self command she fall upon her knee beside the table and begin pray aloud with that frenzied earnestness which intense overpower fear can produce break off now and again into half hysterical whimpering could distinguish the sound clearly enough now to know that her quick feminine perception have not deceive she and that it be indeed cause by run man on he come and on down the high road his footfall ring out clearer and sharp every moment an urgent messenger he must be for he neither pause nor slacken his pace the quick crisp rattle be change suddenly to dull muffle murmur he have reach the point where sand have be recently lay down for hundred yard or so in few moment however he be back on hard ground again and his fly foot come near and ever near he must reflect be abreast of the head of the lane now would he hold on or would he turn down to branksome?the thought have hardly cross my mind when hear by the difference of the sound that the runner have turn the corner and that his goal be beyond all question the laird 's house rush down to the gate of the lawn reach it just as our visitor dash it open and fall into my arm could see in the moonlight that it be none other than mordaunt heatherstone "what have happen cry what be amiss mordaunt?""my father he gasp my father!"his hat be go his eye dilate with terror and his face as bloodless as that of corpse could feel that the hand which clasp my arm be quiver and shake with emotion "you be exhaust say lead he into the parlour give yourself moment 's rest before you speak to we be calm man you be with your good friend "i lay he on the old horsehair sofa while esther whose fear have all fly to the wind now that something practical be to be do dash some brandy into tumbler and bring it to he the stimulant have marvellous effect upon he for the colour begin to come back into his pale cheek and the light of recognition in his eye he sit up and take esther 's hand in both of his like man who be wake out of some bad dream and wish to assure himself that he be really in safety "your father ask what of him?""he be go ""gone!""yes he be go and so be corporal rufus smith we shall never set eye upon they again ""but where have they go cry this be unworthy of you mordaunt what right have we to sit here allow our private feeling to overcome we while there be possibility of succour your father up man let we follow he tell i only what direction he take ""it be no use young heatherstone answer bury his face in his hand do n't reproach i west for you do n't know all the circumstance what can we do to reverse the tremendous and unknown law which be act against we the blow have long be hang over we and now it have fall god help us!""in heaven 's name tell i what have happen say excitedly we must not yield to despair ""we can do nothing until daybreak he answer we shall then endeavour to obtain some trace of they it be hopeless at present ""and how about gabriel and mrs. heatherstone ask can we not bring they down from the hall at once your poor sister must be distract with terror ""she know nothing of it mordaunt answer she sleep at the other side of the house and have not hear or see anything as to my poor mother she have expect some such event for so long time that it have not come upon she as surprise she be of course overwhelm with grief but would think prefer to be leave to herself for the present her firmness and composure should be lesson to i but be constitutionally excitable and this catastrophe come after our long period of suspense deprive i of my very reason for time ""if we can do nothing until the morning say you have time to tell we all that have occur ""i will do so he answer rise and hold his shake hand to the fire you know already that we have have reason for some time for many year in fact to fear that terrible retribution be hang over my father 's head for certain action of his early life in this action he be associate with the man know as corporal rufus smith so that the fact of the latter find his way to my father be warning to we that the time have come and that this 5th of october the anniversary of the misdeed would be the day of its atonement tell you of our fear in my letter and if be not mistaken my father also have some conversation with you john upon the subject when see yesterday morning that he have hunt out the old uniform which he have always retain since he wear it in the afghan war be sure that the end be at hand and that our foreboding would be realise "he appear to be more compose in the afternoon than have see he for year and speak freely of his life in india and of the incident of his youth about nine o'clock he request we to go up to our own room and lock we in there precaution which he frequently take when the dark fit be upon he it be always his endeavour poor soul to keep we clear of the curse which have fall upon his own unfortunate head before part from we he tenderly embrace my mother and gabriel and he afterwards follow i to my room where he clasp my hand affectionately and give into my charge small packet address to yourself ""to i interrupt "to you shall fulfill my commission when have tell you my story conjure he to allow i to sit up with he and share any danger which might arise but he implore i with irresistible earnestness not to add to his trouble by thwart his arrangement see that be really distress he by my pertinacity at last allow he to close the door and to turn the key upon the outside shall always reproach myself for my want of firmness but what can you do when your own father refuse your assistance or co operation you can not force yourself upon he ""i be sure that you do all you could do my sister say "i mean to dear esther but god help i it be hard to tell what be right he leave i and hear his footstep die away down the long corridor it be then about ten o'clock or little after for time pace up and down the room and then carry the lamp to the head of my bed lie down without undressing read st. thomas kempis and pray from my heart that the night might pass safely over we "i have at last fall into troubled sleep when be suddenly arouse by loud sonorous sound ring in my ear sit up bewildered but all be silent again the lamp be burn low and my watch show i that it be go on to midnight blunder to my foot and be strike match with the intention of light the candle when the sharp vehement cry break out again so loud and so clear that it might have be in the very room with i my chamber be in the front of the house while those of my mother and sister be at the back so that be the only one who command view of the avenue "rushe to the window draw the blind aside and look out you know that the gravel drive open up so as to form broad stretch immediately in front of the house just in the centre of this clear space there stand three man look up at the house "the moon shine full upon they glisten on their upturned eyeball and by its light could see that they be swarthy faced and black haired of type that be familiar with among the sikhs and afridis two of they be thin with eager aesthetic countenance while the third be kinglike and majestic with noble figure and flow beard ""ram singh ejaculate "what you know of they exclaim mordaunt in great surprise you have meet them?""i know of they they be buddhist priest answer but go on ""they stand in line he continue sweep their arm upwards and downward while their lip move as if repeat some prayer or incantation suddenly they cease to gesticulate and break out for the third time into the wild weird pierce cry which have rouse i from my slumber never shall forget that shrill dreadful summon swell and reverberate through the silent night with an intensity of sound which be still ring in my ear "as it die slowly away there be rasping and creak as of key and bolt follow by the clang of an opening door and the clatter of hurry foot from my window see my father and corporal rufus smith rush frantically out of the house hatless and unkempt like man who be obey sudden and overpower impulse the three stranger lay no hand on they but all five sweep swiftly away down the avenue and vanish among the tree be positive that no force be use or constraint of any visible kind and yet be as sure that my poor father and his companion be helpless prisoner as if have see they drag away in manacle "all this take little time in the acting from the first summon which disturb my sleep to the last shadowy glimpse which have of they between the tree trunk could hardly have occupy more than five minute of actual time so sudden be it and so strange that when the drama be over and they be go could have believe that it be all some terrible nightmare some delusion have not feel that the impression be too real too vivid to be impute to fancy "i throw my whole weight against my bedroom door in the hope of force the lock it stand firm for while but fling myself upon it again and again until something snap and find myself in the passage "my first thought be for my mother rush to her room and turn the key in her door the moment that do so she step out into the corridor in her dressing gown and hold up warning finger "'no noise she say gabriel be asleep they have be call away?'"'they have answer "'god 's will be do she cry your poor father will be happy in the next world than he have ever be in this thank heaven that gabriel be asleep give she chloral in her cocoa '"'what be to do say distractedly "'where have they go how can help he we can not let he go from we like this or leave these man to do what they will with he shall ride into wigtown and arouse the police?'"'anything rather than that my mother say earnestly he have beg i again and again to avoid it my son we shall never set eye upon your father again you may marvel at my dry eye but if you know as know the peace which death would bring he you could not find it in your heart to mourn for he all pursuit be feel vain and yet some pursuit there must be let it be as private as possible we can not serve he well than by consult his wish '"'but every minute be precious cry even now he may be call upon we to rescue he from the clutch of those dark skinned fiend '"the think so madden i that rush out of the house and down to the high road but once there have no indication in which direction to turn the whole wide moor lie before i without sign of movement upon its broad expanse listen but not sound break the perfect stillness of the night "it be then my dear friend as stand not know in which direction to turn that the horror and responsibility break full upon i feel that be combat against force of which know nothing all be strange and dark and terrible "the thought of you and of the help which might look for from your advice and assistance be beacon of hope to i at branksome at least should receive sympathy and above all direction as to what should do for my mind be in such whirl that can not trust my own judgment my mother be content to be alone my sister asleep and no prospect of be able to do anything until daybreak under those circumstance what more natural than that should fly to you as fast as my foot would carry i you have clear head jack speak out man and tell i what should do esther what should do?"he turn from one to the other of we with outstretche hand and eager question eye "you can do nothing while the darkness last answer we must report the matter to the wigtown police but we need not send our message to they until we be actually start upon the search so as to comply with the law and yet have private investigation as your mother wish john fullarton over the hill have lurcher dog which be as good as bloodhound if we set he on the general 's trail he will run he down if he have to follow he to john groat's ""it be terrible to wait calmly here while he may need our assistance ""i fear our assistance could under any circumstance do he little good there be force at work here which be beyond human intervention besides there be no alternative we have apparently no possible clue as to the direction which they have take and for we to wander aimlessly over the moor in the darkness would be to waste the strength which may be more profitably use in the morning it will be daylight by five o'clock in an hour or so we can walk over the hill together and get fullarton 's dog ""another hour mordaunt groan every minute seem an age ""lie down on the sofa and rest yourself say i. you can not serve your father well than by lay up all the strength you can for we may have weary trudge before we but you mention packet which the general have intend for i ""it be here he answer draw small flat parcel from his pocket and hand it over to i you will find no doubt that it will explain all which have be so mysterious "the packet be seal at each end with black wax bear the impress of the fly griffin which know to be the general 's crest it be far secure by band of broad tape which cut with my pocket knife across the outside be write in bold handwriting j. fothergill west esq and underneath to be hand to that gentleman in the event of the disappearance or decease of major general j. b. heatherstone v.c. c.b. late of the indian army "so at last be to know the dark secret which have cast shadow over our life here in my hand hold the solution of it with eager finger break the seal and undo the wrapper note and small bundle of discolour paper lie within draw the lamp over to i and open the former it be date the precede afternoon and run in this way my dear west should have satisfy your very natural curiosity on the subject which we have have occasion to talk of more than once but refrain for your own sake know by sad experience how unsettling and unnerve it be to be for ever wait for catastrophe which you be convinced must befall and which you can neither avert nor accelerate though it affect i specially as be the person most concerned be still conscious that the natural sympathy which have observe in you and your regard for gabriel 's father would both combine to render you unhappy if you know the hopelessness and yet the vagueness of the fate which threaten i fear to disturb your mind and be therefore silent though at some cost to myself for my isolation have not be the least of the trouble which have weigh i down many sign however and chief among they the presence of the buddhists upon the coast as describe by you this morning have convince i that the weary waiting be at last over and that the hour of retribution be at hand why should have be allow to live nearly forty year after my offence be more than can understand but it be possible that those who have command over my fate know that such life be the great of all penalty to i never for an hour night or day have they suffer i to forget that they have mark i down as their victim their accurse astral bell have be ring my knell for two score year remind i ever that there be no spot upon earth where can hope to be in safety oh the peace the bless peace of dissolution come what may on the other side of the tomb shall at least be quit of that thrice terrible sound there be no need for i to enter into the wretched business again or to detail at any length the event of october 5th 1841 and the various circumstance which lead up to the death of ghoolab shah the arch adept have tear sheaf of leave from my old journal in which you will find bald account of the matter and an independent narrative be furnish by sir edward elliott of the artillery to the star of india some year ago in which however the name be suppress have reason to believe that many people even among those who know india well think that sir edward be romance and that he have evolve his incident from his imagination the few faded sheet which send you will show you that this be not the case and that our man of science must recognise power and law which can and have be use by man but which be unknown to european civilisation do not wish to whine or to whimper but can not help feel that have have hard measure deal i in this world would not god know take the life of any man far less an aged one in cold blood my temper and nature however be always fiery and headstrong and in action when my blood be up have no knowledge of what be about neither the corporal nor would have lay finger upon ghoolab shah have we not see that the tribesman be rally behind he well well it be an
