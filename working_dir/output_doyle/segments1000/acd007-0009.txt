unfortunate friend john berthier heatherstone.i throw aside the letter and pick up the roll of blue foolscap which contain the solution of the mystery it be all ragged and fray at the inner edge with trace of gum and thread still adhere to it to show that it have be tear out of strongly bound volume the ink with which it have be write be fade somewhat but across the head of the first page be inscribe in bold clear character evidently of later date than the rest journal of lieutenant j. b. heatherstone in the thull valley during the autumn of 1841 and then underneath this extract contain some account of the event of the first week of october of that year include the skirmish of the terada ravine and the death of the man ghoolab shah have the narrative lie before i now and copy it verbatim if it contain some matter which have no direct bearing upon the question at issue can only say that think it well to publish what be irrelevant than by cut and clip to lay the whole statement open to the charge of having be tamper with thull valley oct. 1841 the fifth bengal and thirty third queen 's pass through this morning on their way to the front have tiffin with the bengalese late news from home that two attempt have be make on the queen 's life by semi maniacs name francis and bean it promise to be hard winter the snow line have descend thousand foot upon the peak but the pass will be open for week to come and even if they be block we have establish so many depot in the country that pollock and nott will have no difficulty in hold their own they shall not meet with the fate of elphinstone 's army one such tragedy be enough for century elliott of the artillery and be answerable for the safety of the communication for distance of twenty mile or more from the mouth of the valley to this side of the wooden bridge over the lotar goodenough of the rifles be responsible on the other side and lieutenant colonel sidney herbert of the engineers have general supervision over both section our force be not strong enough for the work which have to be do have company and half of our own regiment and squadron of sowars who be of no use at all among the rock elliott have three gun but several of his man be down with cholera and doubt if he have enough to serve more than two.(note capsicum for cholera try it)on the other hand each convoy be usually provide with some guard of its own though it be often absurdly inefficient these valley and ravine which branch out of the main pass be alive with afridis and pathans who be keen robber as well as religious fanatic wonder they do n't swoop down on some of our caravan they could plunder they and get back to their mountain fastness before we could interfere or overtake they nothing but fear will restrain they if have my way would hang one at the mouth of every ravine as warning to the gang they be personification of the devil to look at hawk nosed full lipped with mane of tangled hair and most satanic sneer no news today from the front october must really ask herbert for another company at the very least be convince that the communication would be cut off if any serious attack be make upon we now this morning two urgent message be send i from two different point more than sixteen mile apart to say that there be sign of descent of the tribe elliott with one gun and the sowars go to the farther ravine while with the infantry hurry to the other but we find it be false alarm see no sign of the hillmen and though we be greet by splutter of jezail bullet we be unable to capture any of the rascal woe betide they if they fall into my hand would give they as short shrift as ever highland cateran get from glasgow judge these continue alarm may mean nothing or they may be an indication that the hillmen be assemble and have some plan in view we have have no news from the front for some time but to day convoy of wound come through with the intelligence that nott have take ghuznee hope he warm up any of the black rascal that fall into his hand no word of pollock an elephant battery come up from the punjab look in very good condition there be several convalescent with it go up to rejoin their regiment know none of they except mostyn of the hussars and young blakesley who be my fag at charterhouse and whom have never see since punch and cigarsal frescoup to eleven o'clock letter to day from wills co. about their little bill forward on from delhi think campaign free man from these annoyance will say in his note that since his write application have be in vain he must call upon i in person if he call upon i now he will assuredly be the bold and most persevering of tailor line from calcutta daisy and another from hobhouse to say that matilda come in for all the money under the will be glad of it october glorious news from the front today barclay of the madras cavalry gallop through with dispatch pollock enter cabul triumphantly on the 16th of last month and well still lady sale have be rescue by shakespear and bring safe into the british camp together with the other hostage te deum laudamus!this should end the whole wretched business this and the sack of the city hope pollock wo n't be squeamish or truckle to the hysterical party at home the town should be lay in ashe and the field sow with salt above all the residency and the palace must come down so shall burnes mcnaghten and many another gallant fellow know that his countryman could avenge if they could not save him!it be hard when other be gain glory and experience to be stick in this miserable valley have be out of it completely bar few petty skirmish however we may see some service yet jemidar of our bring in hillman today who say that the tribe be mass in the terada ravine ten mile to the north of we and intend attack the next convoy we ca n't rely on information of this sort but there may prove to be some truth in it propose to shoot our informant so as to prevent his play the double traitor and report our proceeding elliott demur if you be make war you should throw no chance away hate half and half measure the child of israel seem to have be the only people who ever carry war to its logical conclusion except cromwell in ireland make compromise at last by which the man be to be detain as prisoner and execute if his information prove to be false only hope we get fair chance of show what we can do no doubt these fellow at the front will have c.b. 's and knighthood shower upon they thick and fast while we poor devil who have have most of the responsibility and anxiety will be pass over completely elliott have whitlow the last convoy leave we large packet of sauce but as they forget to leave anything to eat with they we have hand they over to the sowars who drink they out of their pannikin as if they be liqueur we hear that another large convoy may be expect from the plain in the course of day or two take nine to four on cleopatra for the calcutta cup october the hillmen really mean business this time think we have have two of our spy come in this morning with the same account about the gathering in the terada quarter that old rascal zemaun be at the head of it and have recommend the government to present he with telescope in return for his neutrality there will be no zemaun to present it to if can but lay hand upon he we expect the convoy tomorrow morning and need anticipate no attack until it come up for these fellow fight for plunder not for glory though to do they justice they have plenty of pluck when they get start have devise an excellent plan and it have elliott 's hearty support by jove if we can only manage it it will be as pretty ruse as ever hear of our intention be to give out that we be go down the valley to meet the convoy and to block the mouth of pass from which we profess to expect an attack very good we shall make night march to night and reach their camp once there shall conceal my two hundred man in the waggon and travel up with the convoy again our friend the enemy having hear that we intend to go south and see the caravan go north without we will naturally swoop down upon it under the impression that we be twenty mile away we shall teach they such lesson that they would as soon think of stop thunderbolt as of interfere again with one of her britannic majesty 's provision train be all on thorn to be off elliott have rig up two of his gun so ingeniously that they look more like costermonger barrow than anything else to see artillery ready for action in the convoy might arouse suspicion the artilleryman will be in the waggon next the gun all ready to unlimber and open fire infantry in front and rear have tell our confidential and discreet sepoy servant the plan which we do not intend to adopt n.b. if you wish thing to be noise over whole province always whisper it under vow of secrecy to your confidential native servant.8.45 p.m. just start for the convoy may luck go with us!october seven o'clock in the evening io triumphe!crown we with laurel elliott and myself who can compare with we as vermin killers?i have only just get back tired and weary stain with blood and dust but have sit down before either washing or change to have the satisfaction of see our deed set forth in black and white if only in my private log for no eye but my own shall describe it all fully as preparation for an official account which must be draw up when elliott get back billy dawson use to say that there be three degree of comparison prevarication lie and an official account we at least can not exaggerate our success for it would be impossible to add anything to it we set out then as per programme and come upon the camp near the head of the valley they have two weak company of the 54th with they who might no doubt have hold their own with warning but an unexpected rush of wild hillmen be very difficult thing to stand against with our reinforcement however and on our guard we might defy the rascal chamberlain be in command fine young fellow we soon make he understand the situation and be all ready for start by daybreak though his waggon be so full that we be compel to leave several ton of fodder behind in order to make room for my sepoys and for the artillery about five o'clock we inspan to use an africanism and by six we be well on our way with our escort as straggle and unconcerned as possible as helpless look caravan as ever invite attack could soon see that it be to be no false alarm this time and that the tribe really mean business from my post of observation under the canvas screen of one of the waggon could make out turbane head pop up to have look at we from among the rock and an occasional scout hurry northward with the news of our approach it be not however until we come abreast of the terada pass gloomy defile bound by gigantic cliff that the afridis begin to show in force though they have ambush themselves so cleverly that have we not be keenly on the look out for they we might have walk right into the trap as it be the convoy halt upon which the hillmen see that they be observe open heavy but ill direct fire upon we have ask chamberlain to throw out his man in skirmishing order and to give they direction to retreat slowly upon the waggon so as to draw the afridis on the ruse succeed to perfection as the redcoat steadily retire keep behind cover as much as possible the enemy follow they up with yell of exultation spring from rock to rock wave their jezail in the air and howl like pack of demon with their black contort mock face their fierce gesture and their flutter garment they would have make study for any painter who wish to portray milton 's conception of the army of the damned from every side they press in until see as they think nothing between they and victory they leave the shelter of the rock and come rush down furious howl throng with the green banner of the prophet in their van now be our chance and gloriously we utilise it from every cranny and slit of the waggon come blaze of fire every shot of which tell among the close pack mob two or three score roll over like rabbit and the rest reel for moment and then with their chief at their head come on again in magnificent rush it be useless however for undisciplined man to attempt to face such well direct fire the leader be bowl over and the other after hesitate for few moment turn and make for the rock it be our turn now to assume the offensive the gun be unlimbered and grape pour into they while our little infantry force advance at the double shoot and stab all whom they overtook never have know the tide of battle turn so rapidly and so decisively the sullen retreat become flight and the flight panic stricken rout until there be nothing leave of the tribesman except scatter demoralise rabble fly wildly to their native fastness for shelter and protection be by no mean inclined to let they off cheaply now that have they in my power on the contrary determine to teach they such lesson that the sight of single scarlet uniform would in future be passport in itself we follow hard upon the track of the fugitive and enter the terada defile at their very heel having detach chamberlain and elliott with company on either side to protect my wing push on with my sepoys and handful of artilleryman give the enemy no time to rally or to recover themselves we be so handicapped however by our stiff european uniform and by our want of practice in climbing that we should have be unable to overtake any of the mountaineer have it not be for fortunate accident there be small ravine which open into the main pass and in their hurry and confusion some of the fugitive rush down this see sixty or seventy of they turn down but should have pass they by and continue in pursuit of the main body have not one of my scout come rustle up to inform i that the small ravine be acul de sac and that the afridis who have go up it have no possible mean of get out again except by cut their way through our rank here be an opportunity of strike terror into the tribe leave chamberlain and elliott to continue the pursuit of the main body wheel my sepoys into the narrow path and proceed slowly down it in extend order cover the whole ground from cliff to cliff not jackal could have pass we unseen the rebel be catch like rat in trap the defile in which we find ourselves be the most gloomy and majestic that have ever see on either side naked precipice rise sheer up for thousand foot or more converge upon each other so as to leave very narrow slit of daylight above we which be far reduce by the feathery fringe of palm tree and aloe which hang over each lip of the chasm the cliff be not more than couple of hundred yard apart at the entrance but as we advance they grow near and near until half company in close order could hardly march abreast sort of twilight reign in this strange valley and the dim uncertain light make the great basalt rock loom up vague and fantastic there be no path and the ground be most uneven but push on briskly caution my fellow to have their finger on their trigger for could see that we be near the point where the two cliff would form an acute angle with each other at last we come in sight of the place great pile of boulder be heap up at the very end of the pass and among these our fugitive be skulk entirely demoralise apparently and incapable of resistance they be useless as prisoner and it be out of the question to let they go so there be no choice but to polish they off wave my sword be lead my man on when we have most dramatic interruption of sort which have see once or twice on the board of drury lane but never in real life in the side of the cliff close to the pile of stone where the hillmen be make their last stand there be cave which look more like the lair of some wild beast than human habitation out of this dark archway there suddenly emerge an old man such very very old man that all the other veteran whom have see be as chicken compare with he his hair and beard be both as white as snow and each reach more than half way to his waist his face be wrinkle and brown and ebony cross between monkey and mummy and so thin and emaciate be his shrivel limb that you would hardly have give he credit for have any vitality leave be it not for his eye which glitter and sparkle with excitement like two diamond in setting of mahogany this apparition come rush out of the cave and throw himself between the fugitive and our fellow motion we back with as imperious sweep of the hand as ever an emperor use to his slave "man of blood he cry in voice of thunder speak excellent english too this be place for prayer and meditation not for murder desist lest the wrath of the god fall upon you ""stand aside old man shout you will meet with hurt if you do n't get out of the way "i could see that the hillmen be take heart and that some of my sepoys be flinch as if they do not relish this new enemy clearly must act promptly if wish to complete our success dash forward at the head of the white artilleryman who have stick to i the old fellow rush at we with his arm out as if to stop we but it be not time to stick at trifle so pass my sword through his body at the same moment that one of the gunner bring his carbine down upon his head he drop instantly and the hillmen at the sight of his fall set up the most unearthly howl of horror and consternation the sepoys who have be incline to hang back come on again the moment he be disposed of and it do not take we long to consummate our victory hardly man of the enemy get out of the defile alive what could hannibal or caesar have do more our own loss in the whole affair have be insignificant three kill and about fifteen wounded got their banner green wisp of thing with sentence of the koran engrave upon it look after the action for the old chap but his body have disappear though how or whither have no conception his blood be upon his own head he would be alive now if he have not interfere as the constable say at home with an officer in the execution of his duty "the scout tell i that his name be ghoolab shah and that he be one of the high and holy of the buddhist he have great fame in the district as prophet and worker of miracle hence the hubbub when he be cut down they tell i that he be live in this very cave when tamerlane pass this way in 1399 with lot more bosh of that sort go into the cave and how any man could live in it week be mystery to i for it be little more than four foot high and as damp and dismal grotto as ever be see wooden settle and rough table be the sole furniture with lot of parchment scroll with hieroglyphic well he have go where he will learn that the gospel of peace and good will be superior to all his pagan lore peace go with he elliott and chamberlain never catch the main body know they would n't so the honour of the day rest with i ought to get step for it anyhow and perhaps who know some mention in thegazette what lucky chance think zemaun deserve his telescope after all for give it to i shall have something to eat now for be half starve glory be an excellent thing but you can not live upon it october 11 a.m. let i try to set down as calmly and as accurately as can all that occur last night have never be dreamer or visionary so can rely upon my own sense though be bind to say that if any other fellow have tell i the same thing should have doubt he might even have suspect that be deceive at the time have not hear the bell since however must narrate what happen elliott be in my tent with i have quiet cheroot until about ten o'clock then walk the round with my jemidar and having see that all be right turn in little before eleven be just drop off to sleep for be dog tired after the day 's work when be arouse by some slight noise and look round see man dress in asiatic costume stand at the entrance of my tent he be motionless when see he and he have his eye fix upon i with solemn and stern expression my first thought be that the fellow be some ghazi or afghan fanatic who have steal in with the intention of stab i and with this idea in my mind have all the will to spring from my couch and defend myself but the power be unaccountably lack an overpower languor and want of energy possess i have see the dagger descend upon my breast could not have make an effort to avert it suppose bird when it be under the influence of snake feel very much as do in the presence of this gloomy faced stranger my mind be clear enough but my body be as torpid as though be still asleep shut my eye once or twice and try to persuade myself that the whole thing be delusion but every time that open they there be the man still regard i with the same stony menacing stare the silence become unendurable feel that must overcome my languor so far as to address he be not nervous man and never know before what virgil mean when he write adhoesit faucibus ora at last manage to stammer out few word ask the intruder who he be and what he want "lieutenant heatherstone he answer speak slowly and gravely you have commit this day the foul sacrilege and the great crime which it be possible for man to do you have slay one of the thrice bless and reverend one an arch adept of the first degree an elder brother who have trod the high path for more year than you have number month you have cut he off at time when his labour promise to reach climax and when he be about to attain height of occult knowledge which would have bring man one step near to his creator all this
