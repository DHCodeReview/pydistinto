be mistaken the man answer respectfully but firmly have be here for an hour and no one have pass from the tent "puzzle and disconcert be sit by the side of my couch wonder whether the whole thing be delusion bring on by the nervous excitement of our skirmish when new marvel overtake i from over my head there suddenly sound sharp tinkle sound like that produce by an empty glass when flip by the nail only louder and more intense look up but nothing be to be see examine the whole interior of the tent carefully but without discover any cause for the strange sound at last wear out with fatigue give the mystery up and throw myself on the couch be soon fast asleep when awake this morning be inclined to put the whole of my yesternight 's experience down to imagination but be soon disabuse of the idea for have hardly rise before the same strange sound be repeat in my very ear as loudly and to all appearance as causelesly as before what it be or where it come from can not conceive have not hear it since can the fellow 's threat have something in they and this be the warn bell of which he speak surely it be impossible yet his manner be indescribably impressive have try to set down what he say as accurately as can but fear have omit good deal what be to be the end of this strange affair must go in for course of religion and holy water not word to chamberlain or elliott they tell i be look like ghost this morning evening have manage to compare note with gunner rufus smith of the artillery who knock the old fellow over with the butt of his gun his experience have be the same as mine he have hear the sound too what be the meaning of it all my brain be in whirl oct. 10 four day later god help us!this last laconic entry terminate the journal it seem to i that come as it do after four day complete silence it tell clear tale of shake nerve and broken spirit than could any more elaborate narrative pin on to the journal be supplementary statement which have evidently be recently add by the general "from that day to this it say have have no night or day free from the intrusion of that dreadful sound with its accompany train of thought time and custom have bring i no relief but on the contrary as the year pass over my head my physical strength decrease and my nerve become less able to bear up against the continual strain "i be broken man in mind and body live in state of tension always strain my ear for the hated sound afraid to converse with my fellow for fear of expose my dreadful condition to they with no comfort or hope of comfort on this side of the grave should be willing heaven know to die and yet as each 5th of october come round be prostrate with fear because do not know what strange and terrible experience may be in store for i "forty year have pass since slay ghoolab shah and forty time have go through all the horror of death without attain the bless peace which lie beyond "i have no means of know in what shape my fate will come upon i have immure myself in this lonely country and surround myself with barrier because in my weak moment my instinct urge i to take some step for self protection but know well in my heart how futile it all be they must come quickly now for grow old and nature will forestall they unless they make haste "i take credit to myself that have keep my hand off the prussic acid or opium bottle it have always be in my power to checkmate my occult persecutor in that way but have ever hold that man in this world can not desert his post until he have be relieve in due course by the authority have have no scruple however about expose myself to danger and during the sikh and sepoy war do all that man could do to court death he pass i by however and pick out many young fellow to whom life be only open and who have everything to live for while survive to win crosse and honour which have lose all relish for i "well well these thing can not depend upon chance and there be no doubt some deep reason for it all "one compensation providence have make i in the shape of true and faithful wife to whom tell my dreadful secret before the wedding and who nobly consent to share my lot she have lift half the burden from my shoulder but with the effect poor soul of crush her own life beneath its weight!"my child too have be comfort to i mordaunt know all or nearly all gabriel we have endeavour to keep in the dark though we can not prevent she from know that there be something amiss "i should like this statement to be show to dr. john easterling of stranraer he hear on one occasion this haunt sound my sad experience may show he that speak truth when say that there be much knowledge in the world which have never find its way to england "j. b. heatherstone."it be go on for dawn by the time that have finish this extraordinary narrative to which my sister and mordaunt heatherstone listen with the most absorb attention already we could see through the window that the star have begin to fade and grey light to appear in the east the crofter who own the lurcher dog live couple of mile off so it be time for we to be on foot leave esther to tell my father the story in such fashion as she might we thrust some food in our pocket and set off upon our solemn and eventful errand it be dark enough when we start to make it no easy matter to find our way across the moor but as we advance it grow light and light until by the time we reach fullarton 's cabin it be broad daylight early as it be he be up and about for the wigtown peasant be an early rise race we explain our mission to he in as few word as possible and having make his bargain what scot ever neglect that preliminary he agree not only to let we have the use of his dog but to come with we himself mordaunt in his desire for privacy would have demur at this arrangement but point out to he that we have no idea what be in store for we and the addition of strong able bodied man to our party might prove to be of the utmost consequence again the dog be less likely to give we trouble if we have its master to control it my argument carry the day and the biped accompany we as well as his four footed companion there be some little similarity between the two for the man be towsy head fellow with great mop of yellow hair and straggling beard while the dog be of the long haired unkempt breed look like an animate bundle of oakum all our way to the hall its owner keep retailing instance of the creature 's sagacity and power of scent which accord to his account be little less than miraculous his anecdote have poor audience fear for my mind be fill with the strange story which have be read while mordaunt stride on with wild eye and feverish cheek without thought for anything but the problem which we have to solve again and again as we top an eminence see he look eagerly round he in the faint hope of see some trace of the absentee but over the whole expanse of moorland there be no sign of movement or of life all be dead and silent and deserted our visit to the hall be very brief one for every minute now be of importance mordaunt rush in and emerge with an old coat of his father 's which he hand to fullarton who hold it out to the dog the intelligent brute sniff at it all over then run whine little way down the avenue come back to sniff the coat again and finally elevate its stump of tail in triumph utter succession of sharp yelp to show that it be satisfied that it have strike the trail its owner tie long cord to its collar to prevent it from go too fast for we and we all set off upon our search the dog tug and strain at its leash in its excitement as it follow in the general 's footstep our way lie for couple of hundred yard along the high road and then pass through gap in the hedge and on to the moor across which we be lead in bee line to the northward the sun have by this time rise above the horizon and the whole countryside look so fresh and sweet from the blue sparkle sea to the purple mountain that it be difficult to realise how weird and uncanny be the enterprise upon which we be engage the scent must have lain strongly upon the ground for the dog never hesitate nor stop drag its master along at pace which render conversation impossible at one place in cross small stream we seem to get off the trail for few minute but our keen nosed ally soon pick it up on the other side and follow it over the trackless moor whine and yelp all the time in its eagerness have we not all three be fleet of foot and long of wind we could not have persist in the continuous rapid journey over the roughest of ground with the heather often well nigh up to our waist for my own part have no idea now look back what goal it be which expect to reach at the end of our pursuit can remember that my mind be full of the vague and most varying speculation could it be that the three buddhists have have craft in readiness off the coast and have embark with their prisoner for the east the direction of their track seem at first to favour this supposition for it lie in the line of the upper end of the bay but it end by branch off and strike directly inland clearly the ocean be not to be our terminus by ten o'clock we have walk close upon twelve mile and be compel to call halt for few minute to recover our breath for the last mile or two we have be breast the long weary slope of the wigtown hill from the summit of this range which be nowhere more than thousand foot in height we could see look northward such scene of bleakness and desolation as can hardly be match in any country right away to the horizon stretch the broad expanse of mud and of water mingle and mix together in the wild chaos like portion of some world in the process of formation here and there on the dun colour surface of this great marsh there have burst out patch of sickly yellow reed and of livid greenish scum which only serve to heighten and intensify the gloomy effect of the dull melancholy expanse on the side nearest to we some abandon peat cutting show that ubiquitous man have be at work there but beyond these few petty scar there be no sign anywhere of human life not even crow nor seagull flap its way over that hideous desert this be the great bog of cree it be salt water marsh form by an inroad of the sea and so intersect be it with dangerous swamp and treacherous pitfall of liquid mud that no man would venture through it unless he have the guidance of one of the few peasant who retain the secret of its path as we approach the fringe of rush which mark its border foul dank smell rise up from the stagnant wilderness as from impure water and decay vegetation an earthy noisome smell which poison the fresh upland air so forbid and gloomy be the aspect of the place that our stout crofter hesitate and it be all that we could do to persuade he to proceed our lurcher however not be subject to the delicate impression of our high organisation still run yelp along with its nose on the ground and every fibre of its body quiver with excitement and eagerness there be no difficulty about pick our way through the morass for wherever the five could go we three could follow if we could have have any doubt as to our dog 's guidance they would all have be remove now for in the soft black oozing soil we could distinctly trace the track of the whole party from these we could see that they have walk abreast and furthermore that each be about equidistant from the other clearly then no physical force have be use in take the general and his companion along the compulsion have be psychical and not material once within the swamp we have to be careful not to deviate from the narrow track which offer firm foothold on each side lie shallow sheet of stagnant water overlie treacherous bottom of semi fluid mud which rise above the surface here and there in moist swelter bank mottle over with occasional patch of unhealthy vegetation great purple and yellow fungus have break out in dense eruption as though nature be afflict with foul disease which manifest itself by this crop of plague spot here and there dark crab like creature scuttle across our path and hideous flesh colour worm wriggle and writhe amid the sickly reed swarm of buzzing pipe insect rise up at every step and form dense cloud around our head settle on our hand and face and inoculate we with their filthy venom never have venture into so pestilent and forbid place mordaunt heatherstone stride on however with set purpose upon his swarthy brow and we could but follow he determine to stand by he to the end of the adventure as we advance the path grow narrow and narrow until as we see by the track our predecessor have be compel to walk in single file fullarton be lead we with the dog mordaunt behind he while bring up the rear the peasant have be sulky and surly for little time back hardly answer when speak to but he now stop short and positively refuse to go step far "it be no canny he say besides ken where it will lead we tae ""where then ask "tae the hole cree he answer it be no far frae here be think ""the hole of cree what be that then?""it be great muckle hole in the ground that gang awa doon so deep that naebody could ever reach the bottom indeed there be folk wha say that it be just door leadin intae the bottomless pit itsel' ""you have be there then ask "been there he cry what would be doin' at the hole cree no 've never be there nor any other man in his sense ""how do you know about it then?""my great grandfeyther have be there and that be how ken fullarton answer he be fou one saturday nicht and he go for bet he didna like tae talk aboot it afterwards and he wouldna tell what befell he but he be aye fear the very name he be the first fullarton that be be at the hole cree and he 'll be the last for i if ye'll tak my advice ye'll just gie the matter up and gang hame again for there be na guid tae be get oot this place ""we shall go on with you or without you mordaunt answer let we have your dog and we can pick you up on our way back ""na na he cry 'll no hae my dog scaret wi bogle and run down auld nick as if he be hare the dog shall bide wi i ""the dog shall go with we say my companion with his eye blaze we have no time to argue with you here be five pound note let we have the dog or by heaven shall take it by force and throw you in the bog if you hinder we "i could realise the heatherstone of forty year ago when see the fierce and sudden wrath which light up the feature of his son either the bribe or the threat have the desire effect for the fellow grab at the money with one hand while with the other he surrender the leash which hold the lurcher leave he to retrace his step we continue to make our way into the utmost recess of the great swamp the tortuous path grow less and less define as we proceed and be even cover in place with water but the increase excitement of the hound and the sight of the deep footmark in the mud stimulate we to push on at last after struggle through grove of high bulrush we come on spot the gloomy horror of which might have furnish dante with fresh terror for his inferno "the whole bog in this part appear to have sink in form great funnel shape depression which terminate in the centre in circular rift or open about forty foot in diameter it be whirlpool perfect maelstrom of mud slope down on every side to this silent and awful chasm clearly this be the spot which under the name of the hole of cree bear such sinister reputation among the rustic could not wonder at its impress their imagination for more weird or gloomy scene or one more worthy of the avenue which lead to it could not be conceive the step pass down the declivity which surround the abyss and we follow they with sink feeling in our heart as we realise that this be the end of our search little way from the downward path be the return trail make by the foot of those who have come back from the chasm 's edge our eye fall upon these track at the same moment and we each give cry of horror and stand gaze speechlessly at they for there in those blur footmark the whole drama be reveal five have go down but only three have return none shall ever know the detail of that strange tragedy there be no mark of struggle nor sign of attempt at escape we knelt at the edge of the hole and endeavour to pierce the unfathomable gloom which shroud it faint sickly exhalation seem to rise from its depth and there be distant hurrying clatter sound as of water in the bowel of the earth great stone lie embed in the mud and this hurl over but we never hear thud or splash to show that it have reach the bottom as we hang over the noisome chasm sound do at last rise to our ear out of its murky depth high clear and throbbing it tinkle for an instant out of the abyss to be succeed by the same deadly stillness which have precede it do not wish to appear superstitious or to put down to extraordinary cause that which may have natural explanation that one keen note may have be some strange water sound produce far down in the bowel of the earth it may have be that or it may have be that sinister bell of which have hear so much be this as it may it be the only sign that rise to we from the last terrible resting place of the two who have pay the debt which have so long be owe we join our voice in call with the unreasoning obstinacy with which man will cling to hope but no answer come back to we save hollow moaning from the depth beneath footsore and heart sick we retrace our step and climb the slimy slope once more "what shall we do mordaunt ask in subdue voice we can but pray that their soul may rest in peace "young heatherstone look at i with flash eye "this may be all accord to occult law he cry but we shall see what the law of england have to say upon it suppose achelamay be hang as well as any other man it may not be too late yet to run they down here good dog good dog -- here!"he pull the hound over and set it on the track of the three man the creature sniff at it once or twice and then fall upon its stomach with bristle hair and protrude tongue it lie shiver and tremble very embodiment of canine terror "you see say it be no use contend against those who have power at their
