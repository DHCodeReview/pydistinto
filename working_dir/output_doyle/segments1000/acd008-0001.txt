and mark the smoking chimney the curtained window and the other sign which show that its tenant have arrive vast area of greenhouse gleam like lake on the further side and beyond be the long line of stable and outhouse fifty horse have pass through tamfield the week before so that large as be the preparation they be not more than would be need who and what could this man be who spend his money with so lavish hand his name be unknown birmingham be as ignorant as tamfield as to his origin or the source of his wealth robert mcintyre brood languidly over the problem as he lean against the gate puff his blue cloud of bird's eye into the crisp still air suddenly his eye catch dark figure emerge from the avenue gate and stride up the winding road few minute bring he near enough to show familiar face look over the stiff collar and from under the soft black hat of an english clergyman "good morning mr. spurling ""ah good morning robert how be you be you come my way how slippery the road are!"his round kindly face be beam with good nature and he take little jump as he walk like man who can hardly contain himself for pleasure "have you hear from hector?""oh yes he go off all right

what say feel like fool could not stammer out word with which to thank he all my trouble have be take from my shoulder in an instant and indeed robert can hardly realise it ""he must be most charitable man ""extraordinarily so and so unpretending one would think that it be who be do the favour and he who be the beggar think of that passage about make the heart of the widow sing for joy he make my heart sing for joy can tell you be you come up to the vicarage?""no thank you mr. spurling must go home and get to work on my new picture it be five foot canvas the landing of the romans in kent must have another try for the academy good morning "he raise his hat and continue down the road while the vicar turn off into the path which lead to his home robert mcintyre have convert large bare room in the upper storey of elmdene into studio and thither he retreat after lunch it be as well that he should have some little den of his own for his father would talk of little save of his ledger and account while laura have become peevish and querulous since the one tie which hold she to tamfield have be remove the chamber be bare and bleak one un papered and un carpet but good fire sparkle in the grate and two large window give he the needful light his easel stand in the centre with the great canvas balance across it while against the wall there lean his two last attempt the murder of thomas of canterbury and the signing of magna charta robert have weakness for large subject and broad effect if his ambition be great than his skill he have still all the love of his art and the patience under discouragement which be the stuff out of which successful painter be make twice his brace of picture have journey to town and twice they have come back to he until the finely gild frame which have make such call upon his purse begin to show sign of these varied adventure yet in spite of their depressing company robert turn to his fresh work with all the enthusiasm which conviction of ultimate success can inspire but he could not work that afternoon in vain he dash in his background and outline the long curve of the roman galley do what he would his mind would still wander from his work to dwell upon his conversation with the vicar in the morning his imagination be fascinate by the idea of this strange man live alone amid crowd and yet wield such power that with one dash of his pen he could change sorrow into joy and transform the condition of whole parish the incident of the fifty pound note come back to his mind it must surely have be raffles haw with whom hector spurling have come in contact there could not be two man in one parish to whom so large sum be of so small an account as to be throw to bystander in return for trifling piece of assistance of course it must have be raffles haw and his sister have the note with instruction to return it to the owner could he be find he throw aside his palette and descend into the sitting room he tell laura and his father of his morning 's interview with the vicar and of his conviction that this be the man of whom hector be in quest "tut tut say old mcintyre how be this laura know nothing of this what do woman know of money or of business hand the note over to i and shall relieve you of all responsibility will take everything upon myself ""i can not possibly papa say laura with decision should not think of part with it ""what be the world come to cry the old man with his thin hand hold up in protest you grow more undutiful every day laura this money would be of use to i of use you understand it may be the corner stone of the vast business which shall re construct will use it laura and will pay something four shall we say or even four and half and you may have it back on any day and will give security the security of my well of my word of honour ""it be quite impossible papa his daughter answer coldly it be not my money hector ask i to be his banker those be his very word it be not in my power to lend it as to what you say robert you may be right or you may be wrong but certainly shall not give mr. raffles haw or anyone else the money without hector 's express command ""you be very right about not give it to mr. raffles haw cry old mcintyre with many nod of approbation should certainly not let it go out of the family ""well think that would tell you "robert pick up his tam o'-shanter and stroll out to avoid the discussion between his father and sister which he see be about to be renew his artistic nature revolt at these petty and sordid dispute and he turn to the crisp air and the broad landscape to soothe his ruffled feeling avarice have no place among his failing and his father 's perpetual chatter about money inspire he with positive loathing and disgust for the subject robert be lounge slowly along his favourite walk which curl over the hill with his mind turn from the roman invasion to the mysterious millionaire when his eye fall upon tall lean man in front of he who with pipe between his lip be endeavour to light match under cover of his cap the man be clothe in rough pea jacket and bear trace of smoke and grime upon his face and hand yet there be freemasonry among smoker which override every social difference so robert stop and hold out his case of fusee "a light say he "thank you the man pick out fusee strike it and bend his head to it he have pale thin face short straggling beard and very sharp and curve nose with decision and character in the straight thick eyebrow which almost meet on either side of it clearly superior kind of workman and possibly one of those who have be employ in the construction of the new house here be chance of get some first hand information on the question which have arouse his curiosity robert wait until he have light his pipe and then walk on beside he "are you go in the direction of the new hall he ask "yes "the man 's voice be cold and his manner reserve "perhap you be engage in the building of it?""yes have hand in it ""they say that it be wonderful place inside it have be quite the talk of the district be it as rich as they say?""i be sure do n't know have not hear what they say "his attitude be certainly not encouraging and it seem to robert that he give little sidelong suspicious glance at he out of his keen grey eye yet if he be so careful and discreet there be the more reason to think that there be information to be extract if he could but find way to it "ah there it lie he remark as they top the brow of the hill and look down once more at the great building well no doubt it be very gorgeous and splendid but really for my own part would rather live in my own little box down yonder in the village "the workman puff gravely at his pipe "you be no great admirer of wealth then he say "not i. should not care to be penny rich than be of course should like to sell my picture one must make living but beyond that ask nothing dare say that poor artist or you man who work for your bread have more happiness out of life than the owner of that great palace ""indeed think that it be more than likely the other answer in much more conciliatory voice "art say robert warm to the subject be her own reward what mere bodily indulgence be there which money could buy which can give that deep thrill of satisfaction which come on the man who have conceive something new something beautiful and the daily delight as he see it grow under his hand until it stand before he complete whole with my art and without wealth be happy without my art should have void which no money could fill but really do n't know why should say all this to you "the workman have stop and be stare at he earnestly with look of the deep interest upon his smoke darken feature "i be very glad to hear what you say say he it be pleasure to know that the worship of gold be not quite universal and that there be at least some who can rise above it would you mind my shake you by the hand?"it be somewhat extraordinary request but robert rather pride himself upon his bohemianism and upon his happy facility for make friend with all sort and condition of man he readily exchange cordial grip with his chance acquaintance "you express some curiosity as to this house know the ground pretty well and might perhaps show you one or two little thing which would interest you here be the gate will you come in with me?"here be indeed chance robert eagerly assent and walk up the winding drive amid the grow fir tree when he find his uncouth guide however march straight across the broad gravel square to the main entrance he feel that he have place himself in false position "surely not through the front door he whisper pluck his companion by the sleeve perhaps mr. raffles haw might not like it ""i do n't think there will be any difficulty say the other with quiet smile my name be raffles haw "robert mcintyre 's face must have express the utter astonishment which fill his mind at this most unlooked for announcement for moment he think that his companion must be joke but the ease and assurance with which he lounge up the step and the deep respect with which richly clothe functionary in the hall swing open the door to admit he show that he speak in sober earnest raffles haw glance back and see the look of absolute amazement upon the young artist 's feature he chuckle quietly to himself "you will forgive i wo n't you for not disclose my identity he say lay his hand with friendly gesture upon the other 's sleeve have you know i you would have speak less freely and should not have have the opportunity of learn your true worth for example you might hardly have be so frank upon the matter of wealth have you know that you be speak to the master of the hall ""i do n't think that be ever so astonished in my life gasp robert "naturally you be how could you take i for anything but workman so be chemistry be one of my hobby and spend hour day in my laboratory yonder have only just strike work and as have inhale some not over pleasant gas think that turn down the road and whiff of tobacco might do i good that be how come to meet you and my toilet fear correspond only too well with my smoke grime face but rather fancy know you by repute your name be robert mcintyre be it not?""yes though can not imagine how you know ""well naturally take some little trouble to learn something of my neighbour have hear that there be an artist of that name and presume that artist be not very numerous in tamfield but how do you like the design hope it do not offend your train taste ""indeed it be wonderful marvellous you must yourself have an extraordinary eye for effect ""oh have no taste at all not the slight can not tell good from bad there never be such complete philistine but have the good man in london down and another fellow from vienna they fix it up between they "they have be stand just within the folding door upon huge mat of bison skin in front of they lie great square court pave with many colour marble lay out in labyrinth of arabesque design in the centre high fountain of carve jade shoot five thin feather of spray into the air four of which curve towards each corner of the court to descend into broad marble basin while the fifth mount straight up to an immense height and then tinkle back into the central reservoir on either side of the court tall graceful palm tree shoot up its slender stem to break into crown of droop green leave some fifty foot above their head all round be series of moorish arch in jade and serpentine marble with heavy curtain of the deep purple to cover the door which lie between they in front to right and to left broad staircase of marble carpet with rich thick smyrna rug work lead upwards to the upper storey which be arrange around the central court the temperature within be warm and yet fresh like the air of an english may. "it be take from the alhambra say raffles haw the palm tree be pretty they strike right through the building into the ground beneath and their root be all girt round with hot water pipe they seem to thrive very well ""what beautifully delicate brass work cry robert look up with admire eye at the bright and infinitely fragile metal trelli screen which adorn the space between the moorish arch "it be rather neat but it be not brass work brass be not tough enough to allow they to work it to that degree of fineness it be gold but just come this way with i you wo n't mind wait while remove this smoke?"he lead the way to door upon the left side of the court which to robert 's surprise swing slowly open as they approach it that be little improvement which have adopt remark the master of the house as you go up to door your weight upon the plank release spring which cause the hinge to revolve pray step in this be my own little sanctum and furnish after my own heart "if robert expect to see some fresh exhibition of wealth and luxury he be woefully disappointed for he find himself in large but bare room with little iron truckle bed in one corner few scatter wooden chair dingy carpet and large table heap with book bottle paper and all the otherdebriswhich collect around busy and untidy man motion his visitor into chair raffles haw pull off his coat and turn up the sleeve of his coarse flannel shirt he begin to plunge and scrub in the warm water which flow from tap in the wall "you see how simple my own taste be he remark as he mop his dripping face and hair with the towel this be the only room in my great house where find myself in congenial atmosphere it be homely to i can read here and smoke my pipe in peace anything like luxury be abhorrent to i ""really should not have though it observe robert "it be fact assure you you see even with your view as to the worthlessness of wealth view which be sure be very sensible and much to your credit you must allow that if man should happen to be the possessor of vast well let we say of considerable sum of money it be his duty to get that money into circulation so that the community may be the well for it there be the secret of my fine feather have to exert all my ingenuity in order to spend my income and yet keep the money in legitimate channel for example it be very easy to give money away and no doubt could dispose of my surplus or part of my surplus in that fashion but have no wish to pauperise anyone or to do mischief by indiscriminate charity must exact some sort of money 's worth for all the money which lie out you see my point do n't you?""entirely though really it be something novel to hear man complain of the difficulty of spend his income ""i assure you that it be very serious difficulty with i but have hit upon some plan some very pretty plan will you wash your hand well then perhaps you would care to have look round just come into this corner of the room and sit upon this chair so now will sit upon this one and we be ready to start "the angle of the chamber in which they sit be paint for about six foot in each direction of dark chocolate brown and be furnish with two red plush seat protrude from the wall and in strike contrast with the simplicity of the rest of the apartment "this remark raffles haw be lift though it be so closely joined to the rest of the room that without the change in colour it might puzzle you to find the division it be make to run either horizontally or vertically this line of knob represent the various room you can see dining smoking billiard library and so on upon they will show you the upward action press this one with kitchen upon it "there be sense of motion very slight jar and robert without move from his seat be conscious that the room have vanish and that large arched oaken door stand in the place which it have occupy "that be the kitchen door say raffles haw have my kitchen at the top of the house can not tolerate the smell of cooking we have come up eighty foot in very few second now press again and here we be in my room once more "robert mcintyre stare about he in astonishment "the wonder of science be great than those of magic he remark "yes it be pretty little mechanism now we try the horizontal press the dining knob and here we be you see step towards the door and you will find it open in front of you "robert do as he be bid and find himself with his companion in large and lofty room while the lift the instant that it be free from their weight flash back to its original position with his foot sink into the soft rich carpet as though he be ankle deep in some mossy bank he stare about he at the great picture which line the wall "surely surely see raphael 's touch there he cry point up at the one which face he "yes it be raphael and believe one of his good have very exciting bid for it with the french government they want it for the louvre but of course at an auction the long purse must win ""and
