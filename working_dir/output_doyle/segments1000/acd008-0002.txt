and two alma tademas it seem to i to be pity to hang picture over these wall of carve oak look at those bird hop and singe in the branch they really seem to move and twitter do n't they?""they be perfect never see such exquisite work but why do you call it billiard room mr. haw do not see any board ""oh board be such clumsy uncompromising piece of furniture it be always in the way unless you actually need to use it in this case the board be cover by that square of polished maple which you see let into the floor now put my foot upon this motor you see as he speak the central portion of the flooring fly up and most beautiful tortoise shell plate billiard table rise up to its proper position he press second spring and bagatelle table appear in the same fashion you may have card table or what you will by set the lever in motion he remark but all this be very trifling perhaps we may find something in the museum which may be of more interest to you "he lead the way into another chamber which be furnish in antique style with hanging of the rare and rich tapestry the floor be mosaic of coloured marble scatter over with mat of costly fur there be little furniture but number of louis quatorze cabinet of ebony and silver with delicately paint plaque be range round the apartment "it be perhaps hardly fair to dignify it by the name of museum say raffles haw it consist merely of few elegant trifle which have pick up here and there gem be my strong point fancy that there perhaps might challenge comparison with any private collector in the world lock they up for even the good servant may be tempt "he take silver key from his watch chain and begin to unlock and draw out the drawer cry of wonder and of admiration burst from robert mcintyre as his eye rest upon case after case fill with the most magnificent stone the deep still red of the ruby the clear scintillate green of the emerald the hard glitter of the diamond the many shift shade of beryls of amethyst of onyx of cats'-eyes of opal of agate of cornelian seem to fill the whole chamber with vague twinkling many coloured light long slab of the beautiful blue lapis lazuli magnificent bloodstone specimen of pink and red and white coral long string of lustrous pearl all these be toss out by their owner as careless schoolboy might pour marble from his bag "this be n't bad he say hold up great glowing yellow mass as large as his own head it be really very fine piece of amber it be forward to i by my agent at the baltic twenty eight pound it weigh never hear of so fine one have no very large brilliant there be no very large one in the market but my average be good pretty toy be they not he pick up double handful of emerald from drawer and then let they trickle slowly back into the heap "good heaven cry robert as he gaze from case to case it be an immense fortune in itself surely hundred thousand pound would hardly buy so splendid collection ""i do n't think that you would do for valuer of precious stone say raffles haw laugh why the content of that one little drawer of brilliant could not be buy for the sum which you name have memo here of what have expend up to date on my collection though have agent at work who will probably make very considerable addition to it within the next few week as matter stand however have spend let i see pearl one forty thousand emerald seven fifty ruby eight forty brilliant nine twenty onyx have several very nice onyx two thirty other gem carbuncle agate hum yes it figure out at just over four million seven hundred and forty thousand dare say that we may say five million for have not count the odd money ""good gracious cry the young artist with stare eye "i have certain feeling of duty in the matter you see the cutting polish and general sale of stone be one of those industry which be entirely dependent upon wealth if we do not support it it must languish which mean misfortune to considerable number of people the same apply to the gold filigree work which you notice in the court wealth have its responsibility and the encouragement of these handicraft be among the most obvious of they here be nice ruby it be burmese and the fifth large in existence be inclined to think that if it be uncut it would be the second but of course cut take away great deal he hold up the blaze red stone about the size of chestnut between his finger and thumb for moment and then throw it carelessly back into its drawer come into the smoking room he say you will need some little refreshment for they say that sight seeing be the most exhausting occupation in the world "the chamber in which the bewildered robert now find himself be more luxurious if less rich than any which he have yet see low settee of claret coloured plush be scatter in orderly disorder over mossy eastern carpet deep lounge recline sofas american rocking chair all be to be have for the choosing one end of the room be wall by glass and appear to open upon luxuriant hot house at the further end double line of gilt rail support profusion of the most recent magazine and periodical rack at each side of the inlaid fireplace sustain long line of the pipe of all place and nation english cherrywood french briar german china bowl carve meerschaum scented cedar and myall wood with eastern narghile turkish chibooque and two great golden top hookah to right and leave be series of small locker extend in treble row for the whole length of the room with the name of the various brand of tobacco scroll in ivory work across they above be other large tier of polished oak which hold cigar and cigarette "try that damascus settee say the master of the house as he throw himself into rocking chair it be from the sultan 's upholsterer the turks have very good notion of comfort be confirm smoker myself mr. mcintyre so have be able perhaps to check my architect here more than in most of the other department of picture for example know nothing as you would very speedily find out on tobacco might perhaps offer an opinion now these he draw out some long beautifully roll mellow colour cigar these be really something little out of the common do try one "robert light the weed which be offer to he and lean back luxuriously amid his cushion gaze through the blue balmy fragrant cloud wreath at the extraordinary man in the dirty pea jacket who speak of million as another might of sovereign with his pale face his sad languid air and his bow shoulder it be as though he be crush down under the weight of his own gold there be mute apology an attitude of deprecation in his manner and speech which be strangely at variance with the immense power which he wield to robert the whole whimsical incident have be intensely interesting and amusing his artistic nature blossom out in this atmosphere of perfect luxury and comfort and he be conscious of sense of repose and of absolute sensual contentment such as he have never before experience "shall it be coffee or rhine wine or tokay or perhaps something strong ask raffles haw stretch out his hand to what look like piano board projecting from the wall can recommend the tokay have it from the man who supply the emperor of austria though think may say that get the cream of it "he strike twice upon one of the piano note and sit expectant with sharp click at the end of ten second slide shutter fly open and small tray protrude bear two long taper venetian glass fill with wine "it work very nicely say raffles haw it be quite new thing never before do as far as know you see the name of the various wine and so on print on the note by press the note down complete an electric circuit which cause the tap in the cellar beneath to remain open long enough to fill the glass which always stand beneath it the glass you understand stand upon revolving drum so that there must always be one there the glass be then bring up through pneumatic tube which be set work by the increase weight of the glass when the wine be add to it it be pretty little idea but be afraid that bear you rather with all these petty contrivance it be whim of mine to push mechanism as far as it will go ""on the contrary be fill with interest and wonder say robert warmly it be as if have be suddenly whip up out of prosaic old england and transfer in an instant to some enchanted palace some eastern home of the genii could not have believe that there exist upon this earth such adaptation of mean to an end such complete mastery of every detail which may aid in strip life of any of its petty worry ""i have something yet to show you remark raffles haw but we will rest here for few minute for wish to have word with you how be the cigar?""most excellent ""it be roll in louisiana in the old slavery day there be nothing make like they now the man who have they do not know their value he let they go at merely few shilling apiece now want you to do i favour mr. mcintyre ""i shall be so glad ""you can see more or less how be situate be complete stranger here with the well to do class have little in common be no society man do n't want to call or be call on be student in small way and man of quiet taste have no social ambition at all do you understand?""entirely ""on the other hand my experience of the world have be that it be the rare thing to be able to form friendship with poor man mean with man who be at all eager to increase his income they think much of your wealth and little of yourself have try you understand and know he pause and run his finger through his thin beard robert mcintyre nod to show that he appreciate his position "now you see he continue if be to be cut off from the rich by my own taste and from those who be not rich by my distrust of their motive my situation be an isolated one not that mind isolation be use to it but it limit my field of usefulness have no trustworthy mean of inform myself when and where may do good have already be glad to say meet man to day your vicar who appear to be thoroughly unselfish and trustworthy he shall be one of my channel of communication with the outer world might ask you whether you would be willing to become another?""with the great pleasure say robert eagerly the proposition fill his heart with joy for it seem to give he an almost official connection with this paradise of house he could not have ask for anything more to his taste "i be fortunate enough to discover by your conversation how high ground you take in such matter and how entirely disintereste you be you may have observe that be short and almost rude with you at first have have reason to fear and suspect all chance friendship too often they have prove to be carefully plan beforehand with some sordid object in view good heavens what story could tell you lady pursue by bull have risk my life to save she and have learn afterwards that the scene have be arrange by the mother as an effective introduction and that the bull have be hire by the hour but wo n't shake your faith in human nature have have some rude shock myself look perhaps with jaundiced eye on all who come near i it be the more needful that should have one whom can trust to advise i ""if you will only show i where my opinion can be of any use shall be most happy say robert my people come from birmingham but know most of the folk here and their position ""that be just what want money can do so much good and it may do so much harm shall consult you when be in doubt by the way there be one small question which might ask you now can you tell i who young lady be with very dark hair grey eye and finely chisel face she wear blue dress when see she with astrachan about her neck and cuff "robert chuckle to himself "i know that dress pretty well he say it be my sister laura whom you describe ""your sister really why there be resemblance now that my attention be call to it see she the other day and wonder who she might be she live with you of course?""yes my father she and live together at elmdene ""where hope to have the pleasure of make their acquaintance you have finish your cigar have another or try pipe to the real smoker all be mere trifling save the pipe have most brand of tobacco here the locker be fill on the monday and on saturday they be hand over to the old folk at the alm house so manage to keep it pretty fresh always well if you wo n't take anything else perhaps you would care to see one or two of the other effect which have devise on this side be the armoury and beyond it the library my collection of book be limited one there be just over the fifty thousand volume but it be to some extent remarkable for quality have visigoth bible of the fifth century which rather fancy be unique there be biblia pauperum of 1430 ms of genesis do upon mulberry leave probably of the second century tristan and iseult of the eighth century and some hundred black letter with five very fine specimen of schoffer and fust but those you may turn over any wet afternoon when you have nothing well to do meanwhile have little device connect with this smoking room which may amuse you light this other cigar now sit with i upon this lounge which stand at the further end of the room "the sofa in question be in niche which be line in three side and above with perfectly clear transparent crystal as they sit down the master of the house draw cord which pull out crystal shutter behind they so that they be enclose on all side in great box of glass so pure and so highly polished that its presence might very easily be forget number of golden cord with crystal handle hang down into this small chamber and appear to be connect with long shine bar outside "now where would you like to smoke your cigar say raffles haw with twinkle in his demure eye shall we go to india or to egypt or to china or to to south america say robert there be twinkle whirr and sense of motion the young artist gaze about he in absolute amazement look where he would all round be tree fern and palm with long droop creeper and blaze of brilliant orchid smoking room house england all be go and he sit on settee in the heart of virgin forest of the amazon it be no mere optical delusion or trick he could see the hot steam rise from the tropical undergrowth the heavy drop fall from the huge green leave the very grain and fibre of the rough bark which clothe the trunk even as he gaze green mottled snake curl noiselessly over branch above his head and bright coloured paroquet break suddenly from amid the foliage and flash off among the tree trunk robert gaze around speechless with surprise and finally turn upon his host face in which curiosity be not un mixed with suspicion of fear "people have be burn for less have they not cry raffles haw laugh heartily have you have enough of the amazon what do you say to spell of egypt?"again the whirr the swift flash of pass object and in an instant huge desert stretch on every side of they as far as the eye could reach in the foreground clump of five palm tree tower into the air with profusion of rough cactus like plant bristle from their base on the other side rise rugged gnarl grey monolith carve at the base into huge scarabaeus group of lizard play about on the surface of the old carved stone beyond the yellow sand stretch away into furth space where the dim mirage mist play along the horizon "mr haw can not understand it robert grasp the velvet edge of the settee and gaze wildly about he "the effect be rather startling be it not this egyptian desert be my favourite when lie myself out for contemplative smoke it seem strange that tobacco should have come from the busy practical west it have much more affinity for the dreamy languid east but perhaps you would like to run over to china for change?""not to day say robert pass his hand over his forehead feel rather confused by all these wonder and indeed think that they have affect my nerve little besides it be time that return to my prosaic elmdene if can find my way out of this wilderness to which you have transplant i but would you ease my mind mr. haw by show i how this thing be done?""it be the mere toy complex plaything nothing more allow i to explain have line of very large greenhouse which extend from one end of my smoking room these different house be keep at vary degree of heat and humidity so as to reproduce the exact climate of egypt china and the rest you see our crystal chamber be tramway run with minimum of friction along steel rod by pull this or that handle regulate how far it shall go and it travel as you have see with amazing speed the effect of my hot house be heighten by the roof be invariably conceal by sky which be really very admirably paint and by the introduction of bird and other creature which seem to flourish quite as well in artificial as in natural heat this explain the south american effect ""but not the egyptian ""no it be certainly rather clever have the good man in france at least the good at those large effect to paint in that circular background you understand the palm cacti obelisk and so on be perfectly genuine and so be the sand for fifty yard or so and defy the keen eyed man in england to tell where the deception commence it be the familiar and perhaps rather meretricious effect of circular panorama but carry out in the most complete manner be there any other point?""the crystal box why be it?""to preserve my guest from the effect of the change of temperature it would be poor kindness to bring they back to my smoking room drench through and with the seed of violent cold the crystal have to be keep warm too otherwise vapour would deposit and you would have your view spoil but must you really go then here we be back in the smoking room hope that it will not be your last visit by many one and if may come down to elmdene should be very glad to do so this be the way through the museum "as robert mcintyre emerge from the balmy aromatic atmosphere of the great house into the harsh raw bite air of an english winter evening he feel as though he have be away for long visit in some foreign country time be measure by impression and so vivid and novel have be his feeling that week and week might have elapse since his chat with the smoke grime stranger in the road he walk along with his head in whirl his whole mind possess and intoxicate by the one idea of the boundless wealth and the immense power of this extraordinary stranger small and sordid and mean seem his own elmdene as he approach it and he pass over its threshold full of restless discontent against himself and his surrounding that night after supper robert mcintyre pour forth all that he have see to his father and to his sister so full be he of the one subject that it be relief to he to share his knowledge with other rather for his own sake then than for theirs he depict vividly all the marvel which he have see the profusion of wealth the regal treasure house of gem the gold the marble the extraordinary device the absolute lavishness and complete disregard for money which be show in every detail for an hour he picture with glow word all the wonder which have be show he and end with some pride by describe the request which mr. raffles haw have make and the complete confidence which he have place in he his word have very different effect upon his two listener old mcintyre lean back in his chair with bitter smile upon his lip his thin face crinkle into thousand pucker and his small eye shine with envy and greed his lean yellow hand upon the table be clench until the knuckle gleam white in the lamplight laura on the other hand lean forward her lip part drink in her brother 's word with glow of colour upon either cheek it seem to robert as he glance from one to the other of they that he have never see his father look so evil or his sister so beautiful "who be the fellow then ask the old man after considerable pause hope he get all this in an honest fashion five million in jewel you say good gracious i ready to give it away too but afraid of pauperise any one you can tell he robert that you know of one very deserving case which have not the slight objection to be pauperise ""but who can he possibly be robert cry laura haw can not be his real name he must be some disguised prince or perhaps king in exile oh should have love to have see those diamond and the emerald always think that emerald suit dark people well you must tell i again all about that museum robert ""i do n't think that he be anything more than he pretend to be her brother answer he have the plain quiet manner of an ordinary middle class englishman there be no particular polish that could see he know little about book and picture just enough to appreciate they but nothing more no fancy that he be man quite in our own position of life who have in some way inherit vast sum of course it be difficult for i to form an estimate but should judge that what see to day house picture jewel book and so on could never have be buy under twenty million and be sure that that figure be entirely an under statement ""i never know but one haw say old mcintyre drum his finger on the table he be foreman in my pin fire cartridge case department but he be an elderly single man well hope he get it all honestly hope the money be clean ""and really really he be come to see we cry laura clap her hand oh when do you think he will come robert do give i warning do you think it will be to morrow?""i be sure
