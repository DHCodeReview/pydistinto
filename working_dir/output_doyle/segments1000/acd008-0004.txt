garraweg still survive to enjoy the success which it deserve such be the deed by which raffles haw make himself know throughout the midlands and yet in spite of all his open handedness he be not man to be impose upon in vain the sturdy beggar cringe at his gate and in vain the crafty letter writer pour out thousand fabulous woe upon paper robert be astonish when he bring some tale of trouble to the hall to observe how swift be the perception of the recluse and how unerringly he could detect flaw in narrative or lay his finger upon the one point which ring false be man strong enough to help himself or of such nature as to profit nothing by help none would he get from the master of the new hall in vain for example do old mcintyre throw himself continually across the path of the millionaire and impress upon he by thousand hint and innuendo the hard fortune which have be deal he and the ease with which his fall greatness might be restore raffles haw listen politely bow smile but never show the slight inclination to restore the querulous old gunmaker to his pedestal but if the recluse 's wealth be lure which draw the beggar from far and near as the lamp draw the moth it have the same power of attraction upon another and much more dangerous class strange hard face be see in the village street prowl figure be mark at night steal about among the fir plantation and warn message arrive from city police and county constabulary to say that evil visitor be know to have take train to tamfield but if as raffles haw hold there be few limit to the power of immense wealth it possess among other thing the power of self preservation as one or two people be to learn to their cost "would you mind step up to the hall he say one morning put his head in at the door of the elmdene sitting room have something there that might amuse you he be on intimate term with the mcintyres now and there be few day on which they do not see something of each other they gladly accompany he all three for such invitation be usually the prelude of some agreeable surprise which he have in store for they "i have show you tiger he remark to laura as he lead they into the dining room will now show you something quite as dangerous though not nearly so pretty there be an arrangement of mirror at one end of the room with large circular glass set at sharp angle at the top "look in there in the upper glass say raffles haw "good gracious what dreadful look man cry laura there be two of they and do n't know which be the bad ""what on earth be they do ask robert they appear to be sit on the ground in some sort of cellar ""most dangerous look character say the old man should strongly recommend you to send for policeman ""i have do so but it seem work of supererogation to take they to prison for they be very snugly in prison already however suppose that the law must have its own ""and who be they and how do they come there do tell we mr. haw "laura mcintyre have pretty beseech way with she which go rather piquantly with her queenly style of beauty "i know no more than you do they be not there last night and they be here this morning so suppose it be safe inference that they come in during the night especially as my servant find the window open when they come down as to their character and intention should think that be pretty legible upon their face they look pair of beauty do n't they?""but can not understand in the least where they be say robert stare into the mirror one of they have take to butt his head against the wall no he be bend so that the other may stand upon his back he be up there now and the light be shine upon his face what bewildered ruffianly face it be too should so like to sketch it it would be study for the picture be think of of the reign of terror ""i have catch they in my patent burglar trap say haw they be my first bird but have no doubt that they will not be the last will show you how it work it be quite new thing this flooring be now as strong as possible but every night disconnect it it be do simultaneously by central machine for every room on the ground floor when the floor be disconnect one may advance three or four step either from the window or door and then that whole part turn on hinge and slide you into padded strong room beneath where you may kick your heel until you be release there be central oasis between the hinge where the furniture be group for the night the floor fly into position again when the weight of the intruder be remove and there he must bide while can always take peep at he by this simple little optical arrangement think it might amuse you to have look at my prisoner before hand they over to the head constable who see be now come up the avenue ""the poor burglar cry laura it be no wonder that they look bewildered for suppose mr. haw that they neither know where they be nor how they come there be so glad to know that you guard yourself in this way for have often think that you run danger ""have you so say he smile round at she think that my house be fairly burglar proof have one window which may be use as an entrance the centre one of the three of my laboratory keep it so because to tell the truth be somewhat of night prowler myself and when treat myself to ramble under the star like to slip in and out without ceremony it would however be fortunate rogue who pick the only safe entrance out of hundred and even then he might find pitfall here be the constable but you must not go for miss mcintyre have still something to see in my little place if you will step into the billiard room shall be with you in very few moment "that morning and many morning both before and afterwards be spend by laura at the new hall examine the treasure of the museum play with the thousand costly toy which raffles haw have collect or sallye out from the smoking room in the crystal chamber into the long line of luxurious hot house haw would walk demurely beside she as she flit from one thing to another like butterfly among flower watch she out of the corner of his eye and take quiet pleasure in her delight the only joy which his costly possession have ever bring he be that which come from the entertainment of other by this time his attention towards laura mcintyre have become so mark that they could hardly be mistaken he visibly brighten in her presence and be never weary of devise thousand method of surprising and please she every morning ere the mcintyre family be afoot great bouquet of strange and beautiful flower be bring down by footman from the hall to brighten their breakfast table her slight wish however fantastic be instantly satisfied if human money or ingenuity could do it when the frost last stream be dam and turn from its course that it might flood two meadow solely in order that she might have place upon which to skate with the thaw there come groom every afternoon with sleek and beautiful mare in case miss mcintyre should care to ride everything go to show that she have make conquest of the recluse of the new hall and she on her side play her part admirably with female adaptiveness she fall in with his humour and look at the world through his eye her talk be of almshouse and free library of charity and of improvement he have never scheme to which she could not add some detail make it more complete and more effective to haw it seem that at last he have meet mind which be in absolute affinity with his own here be help mate who could not only follow but even lead he in the path which he have choose neither robert nor his father could fail to see what be go forward but to the latter nothing could possibly be more acceptable than family tie which should connect he however indirectly with man of vast fortune the glamour of the gold bag have creep over robert also and freeze the remonstrance upon his lip it be very pleasant to have the handling of all this wealth even as mere agent why should he do or say what might disturb their present happy relation it be his sister 's business not his and as to hector spurling he must take his chance as other man do it be obviously good not to move one way or the other in the matter but to robert himself his work and his surrounding be become more and more irksome his joy in his art have become less keen since he have know raffles haw it seem so hard to toll and slave to earn such trifling sum when money could really be have for the asking it be true that he have ask for none but large sum be for ever pass through his hand for those who be needy and if he be needy himself his friend would surely not grudge it to he so the roman galley still remained faintly outline upon the great canvas while robert 's day be spend either in the luxurious library at the hall or in stroll about the country listen to tale of trouble and return like tweed suit minister angel to carry raffles haw 's help to the unfortunate it be not an ambitious life but it be one which be very congenial to his weak and easy go nature robert have observe that fit of depression have frequently come upon the millionaire and it have sometimes strike he that the enormous sum which he spend have possibly make serious inroad into his capital and that his mind be trouble as to the future his abstracted manner his clouded brow and his bent head all speak of soul which be weigh down with care and it be only in laura 's presence that he could throw off the load of his secret trouble for five hour day he bury himself in the laboratory and amuse himself with his hobby but it be one of his whim that no one neither any of his servant nor even laura or robert should ever cross the threshold of that outlying building day after day he vanish into it to reappear hour afterwards pale and exhausted while the whirr of machinery and the smoke which stream from his high chimney show how considerable be the operation which he undertake single handed "could not assist you in any way suggest robert as they sit together after luncheon in the smoking room be convinced that you over try your strength should be so glad to help you and know little of chemistry ""do you indeed say raffles haw raise his eyebrow have no idea of that it be very seldom that the artistic and the scientific faculty go together ""i do n't know that have either particularly develop but have take class and work for two year in the laboratory at sir josiah mason 's institute ""i be delighted to hear it haw reply with emphasis that may be of great importance to we it be very possible indeed almost certain that shall avail myself of your offer of assistance and teach you something of my chemical method which may say differ considerably from those of the orthodox school the time however be hardly ripe for that what be it jones?""a note sir "the butler hand it in upon silver salver haw break the seal and run his eye over it "tut tut it be from lady morsley ask i to the lord lieutenant 's ball can not possibly accept it be very kind of they but do wish they would leave i alone very well jones shall write do you know robert be often very unhappy "he frequently call the young artist by his christian name especially in his more confidential moment "i have sometimes fear that you be say the other sympathetically but how strange it seem you who be yet young healthy with every faculty for enjoyment and millionaire ""ah robert cry haw lean back in his chair and send up thick blue wreath from his pipe you have put your finger upon my trouble if be millionaire might be happy but alas be no millionaire!""good heaven gasp robert cold seem to shoot to his inmost soul as it flash upon he that this be prelude to confession of impending bankruptcy and that all this glorious life all the excitement and the colour and change be about to vanish into thin air "no millionaire he stammer "no robert be billionaire perhaps the only one in the world that be what be on my mind and why be unhappy sometimes feel that should spend this money that should put it in circulation and yet it be so hard to do it without fail to do good without do positive harm feel my responsibility deeply it weigh i down be justify in continue to live this quiet life when there be so many million whom might save and comfort if could but reach them?"robert heave long sigh of relief perhaps you take too grave view of your responsibility he say everybody know that the good which you have do be immense what more could you desire if you really wish to extend your benevolence far there be organise charity everywhere which would be very glad of your help ""i have the name of two hundred and seventy of they haw answer you must run your eye over they some time and see if you can suggest any other send my annual mite to each of they do n't think there be much room for expansion in that direction ""well really you have do your share and more than your share would settle down to lead happy life and think no more of the matter ""i could not do that haw answer earnestly have not be single out to wield this immense power simply in order that might lead happy life can never believe that now can you not use your imagination robert and devise method by which man who have command of well let we say for argument 's sake boundless wealth could benefit mankind by it without take away any one 's independence or in any way do harm?""well really now that come to think of it it be very difficult problem say robert "now will submit few scheme to you and you may give i your opinion on they suppose that such man be to buy ten square mile of ground here in staffordshire and be to build upon it neat city consist entirely of clean comfortable little four room house furnish in simple style with shop and so forth but no public house suppose too that he be to offer house free to all the homeless folk all the tramp and break man and out of worker in great britain then having collect they together let he employ they under fitting superintendence upon some colossal piece of work which would last for many year and perhaps be of permanent value to humanity give they good rate of pay and let their hour of labour be reasonable and those of recreation be pleasant might you not benefit they and benefit humanity at one stroke?""but what form of work could you devise which would employ so vast number for so long time and yet not compete with any exist industry to do the latter would simply mean to shift the misery from one class to another ""precisely so should compete with no one what think of do be of sink shaft through the earth 's crust and of establish rapid communication with the antipodes when you have get certain distance down how far be an interesting mathematical problem the centre of gravity would be beneath you presume that your boring be not quite direct towards the centre and you could then lay down rail and tunnel as if you be on the level "then for the first time it flash into robert mcintyre 's head that his father 's chance word be correct and that he be in the presence of madman his great wealth have clearly turn his brain and make he monomaniac he nod indulgently as when one humour child "it would be very nice he say have hear however that the interior of the earth be molten and your workman would need to be salamander ""the late scientific datum do not bear out the idea that the earth be so hot answer raffles haw it be certain that the increase temperature in coal mine depend upon the barometric pressure there be gas in the earth which may be ignite and there be combustible material as we see in the volcano but if we come across anything of the sort in our boring we could turn river or two down the shaft and get the well of it in that fashion ""it would be rather awkward if the other end of your shaft come out under the pacific ocean say robert choke down his inclination to laugh "i have have estimate and calculation from the first live engineer french english and american the point of exit of the tunnel could be calculate to the yard that portfolio in the corner be full of section plan and diagram have agent employ in buy up land and if all go well we may get to work in the autumn that be one device which may produce result another be canal cutting ""ah there you would compete with the railway ""you do n't quite understand intend to cut canal through every neck of land where such convenience would facilitate commerce such scheme when unaccompanie by any toll upon vessel would think be very judicious way of help the human race ""and where pray would you cut the canal ask robert "i have map of the world here haw answer rise and take one down from the paper rack you see the blue pencil mark those be the point where propose to establish communication of course should begin by the obvious duty of finish the panama business ""naturally the man 's lunacy be become more and more obvious and yet there be such precision and coolness in his manner that robert find himself against his own reason endorse and speculate over his plan "the isthmus of corinth also occur to one that however be small matter from either financial or an engineering point of view propose however to make junction here through kiel between the german ocean and the baltic it save you will observe the whole journey round the coast of denmark and would facilitate our trade with germany and russia another very obvious improvement be to join the forth and the clyde so as to connect leith with the irish and american route you see the blue line?""quite so ""and we will have little cutting here it will run from uleaborg to kem and will connect the white sea with the gulf of bothnia we must not allow our sympathy to be insular must we our little charity should be cosmopolitan we will try and give the good people of archangel well outlet for their fur and their tallow ""but it will freeze ""for six month in the year still it will be something then we must do something for the east it would never do to overlook the east ""it would certainly be an oversight say robert who be keenly alive to the comical side of the question raffles haw however in deadly earnest sit scratch away at his map with his blue pencil "here be point where we might be of some little use if we cut through from batoum to the kura river we might tap the trade of the caspian and open up communication with all the river which run into it you notice that they include considerable tract of country then again think that we might venture upon little cutting between beirut on the mediterranean and the upper water of the euphrates which would lead we into the persian gulf those be one or two of the more obvious canal which might knit the human race into close whole ""your plan be certainly stupendous say robert uncertain whether to laugh or to be awe strike you will cease to be man and become one of the great force of nature alter moulding and improve ""that be precisely the view which take of myself that be why feel my responsibility so acutely ""but surely if you will do all this you may rest it be considerable programme ""not at all be patriotic briton and should like to do something to leave my name in the annal of my country should prefer however to do it after my own death as anything in the shape of publicity and honour be very offensive to i have therefore put by eight hundred million in place which shall be duly mention in my will which propose to devote to pay off the national debt can not see that any harm could arise from its extinction "robert sit stare strike dumb by the audacity of the strange man 's word "then there be the heating of the soil there be room for improvement there you have no doubt read of the immense yield which have result in jersey and elsewhere from the running of hot water pipe through the soil the crop be treble and quadruple would propose to try the experiment upon large scale we might possibly reserve the isle of man to serve as pumping and heating station the main pipe would run to england ireland and scotland where they would subdivide rapidly until they form network two foot deep under the whole country pipe at distance of yard would suffice for every purpose ""i be afraid suggest robert that the water which leave the isle of man warm might lose little of its virtue before it reach caithness for example ""there need not be any difficulty there every few mile furnace might be arrange to keep up the temperature these be few of my plan for the future robert and shall want the co operation of disintereste man like yourself in all of they but how brightly the sun shine and how sweet the countryside look the world be very beautiful and should like to leave it happy than find it let we walk out together robert and you will tell i of any fresh case where may be of assistance "whatever good mr. raffles haw 's wealth do to the world there could be no doubt that there be case where it do harm the very contemplation and thought of it have upon many disturbing and mischievous effect especially be this the case with the old gunmaker from be merely querulous and grasp man he have now become bitter brooding and dangerous week by week as he see the tide of wealth flow as it be through his very house without be able to divert the small rill to nourish his own fortune he become more wolfish and more hungry eyed he speak less of his own wrong but he brood more and would stand for hour on tamfield hill look down at the great palace beneath as thirst stricken man might gaze at the desert mirage he have work and peep and pried too until there be point upon which he know more than either his son or his daughter "i suppose that you still do n't know where your friend get his money he remark to robert one morning as they walk together through the village "no father do not only know that he spend it very well ""well snarl the old man yes very well he have help every tramp and slut and worthless vagabond over the countryside but he
