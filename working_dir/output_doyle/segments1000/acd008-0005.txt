more than once what think mr. haw 's object be to help those who be destitute he look upon we as his equal and would not presume to patronise we or to act as if we could not help ourselves it would be humiliation to we to take his money ""pshaw besides it be only question of an advance and advance be make every day among business man how can you talk such nonsense robert?"early as it be his son could see from his excited quarrelsome manner that the old man have be drink the habit have grow upon he of late and it be seldom now that he be entirely sober "mr raffles haw be the good judge say robert coldly if he earn the money he have right to spend it as he like ""and how do he earn it you do n't know robert you do n't know that you be n't aid and abet felony when you help he to fritter it away be ever so much money earn in an honest fashion tell you there never be tell you also that lump of gold be no more to that man than chunk of coal to the miner over yonder he could build his house of they and think nothing of it ""i know that he be very rich father think however that he have an extravagant way of talk sometimes and that his imagination carry he away have hear he talk of plan which the rich man upon earth could not possibly hope to carry through ""don't you make any mistake my son your poor old father be n't quite fool though he be only an honest break merchant he look up sideways at his son with wink and most unpleasant leer where there be money can smell it there be money there and heap of it it be my belief that he be the rich man in the world though how he come to be so should not like to guarantee be not quite blind yet robert have you see the weekly waggon?""the weekly waggon!""yes robert you see can find some news for you yet it be due this morning every saturday morning you will see the waggon come in why here it be now as be live man come round the curve "robert glance back and see great heavy waggon draw by two strong horse lumber slowly along the road which lead to the new hall from the effort of the animal and its slow pace the content seem to be of great weight "just you wait here old mcintyre cry pluck at his son 's sleeve with his thin bony hand wait here and see it pass then we will watch what become of it "they stand by the side of the road until it come abreast of they the waggon be cover with tarpaulin sheeting in front and at the side but behind some glimpse could be catch of the content they consist as far as robert could see of number of packet of the same shape each about two foot long and six inch high arrange symmetrically upon the top of each other each packet be surround by covering of coarse sacking "what do you think of that ask old mcintyre triumphantly as the load creak past "why father what do you make of it?""i have watch it robert have watch it every saturday and have my chance of look little deep into it you remember the day when the elm blow down and the road be block until they could see it in two that be on saturday and the waggon come to stand until they could clear way for it be there robert and see my chance stroll behind the waggon and place my hand upon one of those packet they look small do they not it would take strong man to lift one they be heavy robert heavy and hard with the hardness of metal tell you boy that that waggon be load with gold ""gold!""with solid bar of gold robert but come into the plantation and we shall see what become of it "they pass through the lodge gate behind the waggon and then wander off among the fir tree until they gain spot where they could command view the load have halt not in front of the house but at the door of the out building with the chimney staff of stableman and footman be in readiness who proceed to swiftly unload and to carry the package through the door it be the first time that robert have ever see any one save the master of the house enter the laboratory no sign be see of he now however and in half an hour the content have all be safely store and the waggon have drive briskly away "i can not understand it father say robert thoughtfully as they resume their walk suppose that your supposition be correct who would send he such quantity of gold and where could it come from?""ha you have to come to the old man after all chuckle his companion can see the little game it be clear enough to i there be two of they in it you understand the other one get the gold never mind how but we will hope that there be no harm let we suppose for example that they have find marvellous mine where you can just shovel it out like clay from pit well then he send it on to this one and he have his furnace and his chemical and he refine and purifie it and make it fit to sell that be my explanation of it robert eh have the old man put his finger on it?""but if that be true father the gold must go back again ""so it do robert but little at time ha ha 've have my eye open you see every night it go down in small cart and be send on to london by the 7.40 not in bar this time but do up in iron bind chest 've see they boy and 've have this hand upon they ""well say the young man thoughtfully maybe you be right it be possible that you be right "while father and son be pry into his secret raffles haw have find his way to elmdene where laura sat read thequeenby the fire "i be so sorry she say throw down her paper and spring to her foot they be all out except i but be sure that they wo n't be long expect robert every moment ""i would rather speak with you alone answer raffles haw quietly pray sit down for want to have little chat with you "laura resume her seat with flush upon her cheek and quickening of the breath she turn her face away and gaze into the fire but there be sparkle in her eye which be not catch from the leap flame "do you remember the first time that we meet miss mcintyre he ask stand on the rug and look down at her dark hair and the beautifully feminine curve of her ivory neck "as if it be yesterday she answer in her sweet mellow tone "then you must also remember the wild word that say when we part it be very foolish of i be sure that be most sorry if frighten or disturb you but have be very solitary man for long time and have drop into bad habit of think aloud your voice your face your manner be all so like my ideal of true woman love faithful and sympathetic that could not help wonder whether if be poor man might ever hope to win the affection of such one ""your good opinion mr. raffles haw be very dear to i say laura assure you that be not frightened and that there be no need to apologise for what be really compliment ""since then have find he continue that all that have read upon your face be true that your mind be indeed that of the true woman full of the noble and sweetest quality which human nature can aspire to you know that be man of fortune but wish you to dismiss that consideration from your mind do you think from what you know of my character that you could be happy as my wife laura?"she make no answer but still sit with her head turn away and her sparkle eye fix upon the fire one little foot from under her skirt tap nervously upon the rug "it be only right that you should know little more about i before you decide there be however little to know be an orphan and as far as know without relation upon earth my father be respectable man country surgeon in wales and he bring i up to his own profession before have pass my examination however he die and leave i small annuity have conceive great liking for the subject of chemistry and

give as much as thought to the great canvas which still stand dust cover upon his easel haw give laura an engagement ring of old gold with great blaze diamond bulge out of it there be little talk about the matter however for it be haw 's wish that all should be do very quietly nearly all his evening be spend at elmdene where he and laura would build up the most colossal scheme of philanthropy for the future with map stretch out on the table in front of they these two young people would as it be hover over the world planning devising and improve "bless the girl say old mcintyre to his son

opinion ""oh do n't want to have any scene say mcintyre sulkily relax his effort he live in dread of his daughter and at his bad moment the mention of her name would serve to restrain he "besides say robert have not the slight doubt that raffles haw will see the necessity for give we some sort of explanation before matter go far he must understand that we have some claim now to be take into his confidence "he have hardly speak when there be tap at the door and the man of whom they be speak walk in "good morning mr. mcintyre say he robert would you mind step up to the hall with i want to have little business chat he look serious like man who be carry out something which he have well weigh they walk up together with hardly word on either side raffles haw be absorb in his own thought robert

rain of an english march the snow be go but the countryside look bleaker and dreary all shroud in the haze from the damp sodden meadow "by the way robert say raffles haw suddenly as they walk up the avenue have your great roman picture go to london?""i have not finish it yet ""but know that you be quick worker you must be nearly at the end of it ""no be afraid that it have not advance much since you see it for one thing the light have not be very good "raffles haw say nothing but pained expression flash over his face when they reach the house he lead the way through the museum two great metal case be lie on the floor "i have small addition there to the gem collection he remark as he pass they only arrive last night and have not open they yet but be give to understand from the letter and invoice that there be some fine specimen we might arrange they this afternoon if you care to assist i let we go into the smoking room now "he throw himself down into settee and motion robert into the armchair in front of he "light cigar he say press the spring if there be any refreshment which you would like now my dear robert confess to i in the first place that you have often think i mad "the charge be so direct and so true that the young artist hesitate hardly know how to answer "my dear boy do not blame you it be the most natural thing in the world should have look upon anyone as madman who have talk to i as have talk to you but for all that robert you be wrong and have never yet in our conversation propose any scheme which it be not well within my power to carry out tell you in all sober earnest that the amount of my income be limit only by my desire and that all the banker and financier combine could not furnish the sum which can put forward without an effort ""i have have ample proof of your immense wealth say robert "and you be very naturally curious as to how that wealth be obtain well can tell you one thing the money be perfectly clean have rob no one cheat no one sweat no one ground no one down in the gaining of it can read your father 's eye robert can see that he have do i an injustice in this matter well perhaps he be not to be blame perhaps also might think uncharitable thing if be in his place but that be why now give an explanation to you robert and not to he you at least have trust i and you have right before become one of your family to know

on my unfinished work shall tell you where those direction be to be find in the meantime you must be content to learn the effect which produce without know every detail as to the mean "robert settle himself down in his chair and concentrate his attention upon his companion 's word while haw bend forward his eager earnest face like man who know the value of the word which he be say "you be already aware he remark that have devote great deal of energy and of time to the study of chemistry ""so you tell i ""i commence my study under famous english chemist continue they under the good man in france and complete they in the most celebrated laboratory of germany be not rich but my father have leave i enough to keep i comfortably and by live economically have sum at my command which enable i to carry out my study in very complete way when return to england build myself laboratory in quiet country place where could work without distraction or interruption there begin series of investigation which soon take i into region of science to which none of the three famous man who teach i have ever penetrate "you say robert that you have some slight knowledge of chemistry and you will find it easy to follow what say chemistry be to large extent an empirical science and the chance experiment may lead to great result than could with our present datum be derive from the close study or the keen reasoning the most important chemical discovery from the first manufacture of glass to the whitening and refining of sugar have all be due to some happy chance which might have befall mere dabbler as easily as deep student "well it be to such chance that my own great discovery perhaps the great that the world have see be due though may claim the credit of having originate the line of thought which lead up to it have frequently speculate as to the effect which powerful current of electricity exercise upon any substance through which they be pour for considerable time do
