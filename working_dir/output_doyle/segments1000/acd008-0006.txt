liquid and in compound the force have disintegrate effect the well know experiment of the electrolysis of water will of course occur to you but find that in the case of elemental solid the effect be remarkable one the element slowly decrease in weight without perceptibly alter in composition hope that make myself clear to you?""i follow you entirely say robert deeply interested in his companion 's narrative "i try upon several element and always with the same result in every case an hour 's current would produce perceptible loss of weight my theory at that stage be that there be loosening of the molecule cause by the electric fluid and that certain number of these molecule be shed off like an impalpable dust all round the lump of earth or of metal which remain of course the light by their loss have entirely accept this theory when very remarkable chance lead i to completely alter my opinion "i have one saturday night fasten bar of bismuth in clamp and have attach it on either side to an electric wire in order to observe what effect the current would have upon it have be test each metal in turn expose they to the influence for from one to two hour have just get everything in position and have complete my connection when receive telegram to say that john stillingfleet an old chemist in london with whom have be on term of intimacy be dangerously ill and have express wish to see i the last train be due to leave in twenty minute and live good mile from the station thrust few thing into bag lock my laboratory and run as hard as could to catch it "it be not until be in london that it suddenly occur to i that have neglect to shut off the current and that it would continue to pass through the bar of bismuth until the battery be exhaust the fact however seem to be of small importance and dismiss it from my mind be detain in london until the tuesday night and it be wednesday morning before get back to my work as unlock the laboratory door my mind revert to the uncompleted experiment and it strike i that in all probability my piece of bismuth would have be entirely disintegrate and reduce to its primitive molecule be utterly unprepared for the truth "when approach the table find sure enough that the bar of metal have vanish and that the clamp be empty having note the fact be about to turn away to something else when my attention be attract to the fact that the table upon which the clamp stand be star over with little patch of some liquid silvery matter which lie in single drop or coalesce into little pool have very distinct recollection of having thoroughly clear the table before begin my experiment so that this substance have be deposit there since have leave for london much interested very carefully collect it all into one vessel and examine it minutely there could be no question as to what it be it be the pure mercury and give no response to any test for bismuth "i at once grasp the fact that chance have place in my hand chemical discovery of the very first importance if bismuth be under certain condition to be subject to the action of electricity it would begin by lose weight and would finally be transform into mercury have break down the partition which separate two element "but the process would be constant one it would presumably prove to be general law and not an isolated fact if bismuth turn into mercury what would mercury turn into there would be no rest for i until have solve the question renew the exhausted battery and pass the current through the bowl of quicksilver for sixteen hour sit watch the metal mark how it slowly seem to curdle to grow firm to lose its silvery glitter and to take dull yellow hue when at last pick it up in forceps and throw it upon the table it have lose every characteristic of mercury and have obviously become another metal few simple test be enough to show i that this other metal be platinum "now to chemist there be something very suggestive in the order in which these change have be effect perhaps you can see the relation robert which they bear to each other?""no can not say that do "robert have sit listen to this strange statement with parted lip and stare eye "i will show you speak atomically bismuth be the heavy of the metal its atomic weight be 210 the next in weight be lead 207 and then come mercury at 200 possibly the long period during which the current have act in my absence have reduce the bismuth to lead and the lead in turn to mercury now platinum stand at 197.5 and it be accordingly the next metal to be produce by the continued current do you see now?""it be quite clear ""and then there come the inference which send my heart into my mouth and cause my head to swim round gold be the next in the series its atomic weight be 197 remember now and for the first time understand why it be always lead and mercury winch be mention by the old alchemist as be the two metal which might be use in their calling with finger which tremble with excitement adjust the wire again and in little more than an hour for the length of the process be always in proportion to the difference in the metal have before i knob of ruddy crinkle metal which answer to every reaction for gold "well robert this be long story but think that you will agree with i that its importance justify i in go into detail when have satisfy myself that have really manufacture gold cut the nugget in two one half send to jeweller and worker in precious metal with whom have some slight acquaintance ask he to report upon the quality of the metal with the other half continue my series of experiment and reduce it in successive stage through all the long series of metal through silver and zinc and manganese until bring it to lithium which be the light of all ""and what do it turn to then ask robert "then come what to chemist be likely to be the most interesting portion of my discovery it turn to greyish fine powder which powder give no further result however much might treat it with electricity and that powder be the base of all thing it be the mother of all the element it be in short the substance whose existence have be recently surmise by lead chemist and which have be christen protyle by he be the discoverer of the great law of the electrical transposition of the metal and be the first to demonstrate protyle so that think robert if all my scheme in other direction come to nothing my name be at least likely to live in the chemical world "there be not very much more for i to tell you have my nugget back from my friend the jeweller confirm my opinion as to its nature and its quality soon find several method by which the process might be simplify and especially modification of the ordinary electric current which be very much more effective having make certain amount of gold dispose of it for sum which enable i to buy improve material and strong battery in this way enlarge my operation until at last be in position to build this house and to have laboratory where could carry out my work on much large scale as say before can now state with all truth that the amount of my income be only limit by my desire ""it be wonderful gasp robert it be like fairy tale but with this great discovery in your mind you must have be sorely tempt to confide it to other ""i think well over it give it every consideration it be obvious to i that if my invention be make public its immediate result would be to deprive the present precious metal of all their special value some other substance amber we will say or ivory would be choose as medium for barter and gold would be inferior to brass as be heavy and yet not so hard no one would be the well for such consummation as that now if retain my secret and use it with wisdom might make myself the great benefactor to mankind that have ever live those be the chief reason and trust that they be not dishonourable one which lead i to form the resolution which have today for the first time break ""but your secret be safe with i cry robert my lip shall be seal until have your permission to speak ""if have not know that could trust you should have withhold it from your knowledge and now my dear robert theory be very weak work and practice be infinitely more interesting have give you more than enough of the first if you will be good enough to accompany i to the laboratory shall give you little of the latter "raffles haw lead the way through the front door and cross over the gravel drive push open the outer door of the laboratory the same through which the mcintyres have see the package convey from the waggon on pass through it robert find that they be not really within the building but merely in large bare ante chamber around the wall of which be stack the very object which have arouse his curiosity and his father 's speculation all mystery have go from they now however for while some be still wrap in their sackcloth covering other have be undo and reveal themselves as great pig of lead "there be my raw material say raffles haw carelessly nod at the heap every saturday have waggon load send up which serve i for week but we shall need to work double tide when laura and be married and we get our great scheme under way have to be very careful about the quality of the lead for of course every impurity be reproduce in the gold "a heavy iron door lead into the inner chamber haw unlock it but only to disclose second one about five foot far on "this flooring be all disconnected at night he remark have no doubt that there be good deal of gossip in the servants'-hall about this seal chamber so have to guard myself against some inquisitive ostler or too adventurous butler "the inner door admit they into the laboratory high bare whitewash room with glass roof at one end be the furnace and boiler the iron mouth of which be close though the fierce red light beat through the crack and dull roar sound through the building on either side innumerable huge leyden jar stood range in row tier topping tier while above they be column of voltaic cell robert 's eye as he glance around light on vast wheel complicated network of wire stand test tube coloured bottle graduate glass bunsen burner porcelain insulator and all the varieddebrisof chemical and electrical workshop "come across here say raffles haw pick his way among the heap of metal the coke the packing case and the carboy of acid yours be the first foot except my own which have ever penetrate to this room since the workman leave it my servant carry the lead into the ante room but come no far the furnace can be clean and stoke from without employ fellow to do nothing else now take look in here "he throw open door on the further side and motion to the young artist to enter the latter stand silent with one foot over the threshold stare in amazement around he the room which may have be some thirty foot square be pave and wall with gold great brick shape ingot closely pack cover the whole floor while on every side they be rear up in compact barrier to the very ceiling the single electric lamp which light the windowless chamber strike dull murky yellow light from the vast pile of precious metal and gleam ruddily upon the golden floor "this be my treasure house remark the owner you see that have rather an accumulation just now my import have be exceed my export you can understand that have other and more important duty even than the making of gold just now this be where store my output until be ready to send it off every night almost be in the habit of send case of it to london employ seventeen broker in its sale each think that he be the only one and each be die to know where can get such large quantity of virgin gold they say that it be the pure which come into the market the popular theory be believe that be middleman act on behalf of some new south african mine which wish to keep its whereabout secret what value would you put upon the gold in this chamber it ought to be worth something for it represent nearly week 's work ""something fabulous have no doubt say robert glance round at the yellow barrier shall say hundred and fifty thousand pounds?""oh dear i it be surely worth very much more than that cry raffles haw laugh let i see suppose that we put it at three ten an ounce which be nearly ten shilling under the mark that make roughly fifty six pound for pound in weight now each of these ingot weigh thirty six pound which bring their value to two thousand and few odd pound there be five hundred ingot on each of these three side of the room but on the fourth there be only three hundred on account of the door but there can not be less than two hundred on the floor which give we rough total of two thousand ingot so you see my dear boy that any broker who could get the content of this chamber for four million pound would be do nice little stroke of business ""and week 's work gasp robert it make my head swim ""you will follow i now when repeat that none of the great scheme which intend to simultaneously set in motion be at all likely to languish for want of fund now come into the laboratory with i and see how it be do "in the centre of the workroom be an instrument like huge vice with two large brass colour plate and great steel screw for bring they together numerous wire run into these metal plate and be attach at the other end to the row of dynamic machine beneath be glass stand which be hollow out in the centre into succession of trough "you will soon understand all about it say raffles haw throw off his coat and pull on smoke stain and dirty linen jacket we must first stoke up little he put his weight on pair of great bellow and an answer roar come from the furnace that will do the more heat the more electric force and the quick our task now for the lead just give i hand in carry it "they lift dozen of the pig of lead from the floor on to the glass stand and having adjust the plate on either side haw screw up the handle so as to hold they in position "it use in the early day to be slow process he remark but now that have immense facility for my work it take very short time have now only to complete the connection in order to begin "he take hold of long glass lever which project from among the wire and draw it downwards sharp click be hear follow by loud sparkling crackling noise great spurt of flame spring from the two electrode and the mass of lead be surround by an aureole of golden spark which hiss and snap like pistol shot the air be fill with the peculiar acid smell of ozone "the power there be immense say raffles haw superintend the process with his watch upon the palm of his hand it would reduce an organic substance to protyle instantly it be well to understand the mechanism thoroughly for any mistake might be grave matter for the operator you be deal with gigantic force but you perceive that the lead be already begin to turn "silvery dew like drop have indeed begin to form upon the dull colour mass and to drop with tinkle and splash into the glass troughs slowly the lead melt away like an icicle in the sun the electrode ever close upon it as it contract until they come together in the centre and row of pool of quicksilver have take the place of the solid metal two small electrode be plunge into the mercury which gradually curdle and solidify until it have resume the solid form with yellowish brassy shimmer "what lie in the mould now be platinum remark raffles haw we must take it from the troughs and refix it in the large electrode so now we turn on the current again you see that it gradually take dark and rich tint now think that it be perfect he draw up the lever remove the electrode and there lie dozen brick of ruddy sparkle gold "you see accord to our calculation our morning 's work have be worth twenty four thousand pound and it have not take we more than twenty minute remark the alchemist as he pick up the newly make ingot and throw they down among the other "we will devote one of they to experiment say he leave the last standing upon the glass insulator to the world it would seem an expensive demonstration which cost two thousand pound but our standard you see be different one now you will see i run through the whole gamut of metallic nature "first of all man after the discoverer robert see the gold mass when the electrode be again apply to it change swiftly and successively to barium to tin to silver to copper to iron he see the long white electric spark change to crimson with the strontium to purple with the potassium to yellow with the manganese then finally after hundred transformation it disintegrate before his eye and lie as little mound of fluffy grey dust upon the glass table "and this be protyle say haw pass his finger through it the chemist of the future may resolve it into further constituent but to i it be the ultima thule ""and now robert he continue after pause have show you enough to enable you to understand something of my system this be the great secret it be the secret which endow the man who know it with such universal power as no man have ever enjoy since the world be make this secret it be the dear wish of my heart to use for good and swear to you robert mcintyre that if think it would tend to anything but good would have do with it for ever no would neither use it myself nor would any other man learn it from my lip swear it by all that be holy and solemn!"his eye flash as he speak and his voice quiver with emotion stand pale and lanky amid his electrode and his retort there be still something majestic about this man who amid all his stupendous good fortune could still keep his moral sense undazzle by the glitter of his gold robert 's weak nature have never before realise the strength which lie in those thin firm lip and earnest eye "surely in your hand mr. haw nothing but good can come of it he say "i hope not pray not most earnestly do pray not have do for you robert what might not have do for my own brother have one and have do it because believe and hope that you be man who would not use this power should you inherit it for selfish end but even now have not tell you all there be one link which have withhold from you and which shall be withhold from you while live but look at this chest robert "he lead he to great iron clamp chest which stand in the corner and throw it open he take from it small case of carve ivory "inside this he say have leave paper which make clear anything which be still hide from you should anything happen to i you will always be able to inherit my power and to continue my plan by follow the direction which be there express and now he continue throw his casket back again into the box shall frequently require your help but do not think it will be necessary this morning have already take up too much of your time if you be go back to elmdene wish that you would tell laura that shall be with she in the afternoon "and so the great secret be out and robert walk home with his head in whirl and the blood tingle in his vein he have shiver as he come up at the damp cold of the wind and the sight of the mist mottle landscape that be all go now his own thought tinge everything with sunshine and he feel inclined to sing and dance as he walk down the muddy deeply rut country lane wonderful have be the fate allot to raffles haw but surely hardly less important that which have come upon himself he be the sharer of the alchemist 's secret and the heir to an inheritance which combine wealth great than that of monarchs to freedom such as monarchs can not enjoy this be destiny indeed thousand gold tint vision of his future life rise up before he and in fancy he already sit high above the human race with prostrate thousand implore his aid or thank he for his benevolence how sordid seem the untidy garden with its scrappy bush and gaunt elm tree how mean the plain brick front with the green wooden porch it have always offend his artistic sense but now it be obtrusive in its ugliness the plain room too with the american leather chair the dull coloured carpet and the patchwork rug he feel loathing for it all the only pretty thing in it upon which his eye could rest with satisfaction be his sister as she lean back in her chair by the fire with her white clear beautiful face outline against the dark background "do you know robert she say glance up at he from under her long black lash papa grow unendurable have have to speak very plainly to he and to make he understand that be marry for my own benefit and not for his ""where be he then?""i do n't know at the three pigeons no doubt he spend most of his time there now he fly off in passion and talk such nonsense about marriage settlement and forbid the banns and so on his notion of marriage settlement appear to be settlement upon the bride 's father he should wait quietly and see what can be do for he ""i think laura that we must make good deal of allowance for he say robert earnestly have notice great change in he lately do n't think he be himself at all must get some medical advice but have be up at the hall this morning ""have you have you see raffles do he send anything for me?""he say that he would come down when he have finish his work ""but what be the matter robert cry laura with the swift perception of womanhood you be flushed and your eye be shine and really you look quite handsome raffles have be tell you something what be it oh know he have be tell you how he make his money have n't he now?""well yes he take i partly into his confidence congratulate you laura with all my heart for you will be very wealthy woman ""how strange it seem that he should have come to we in our poverty it be all owe to you you dear old robert for if he have not take fancy to you he would never have come down to elmdene and take fancy to some one else ""not at all robert answer sit down by his sister and
