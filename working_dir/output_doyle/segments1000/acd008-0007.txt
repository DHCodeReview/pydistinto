snow or fine but then of course he be sailor it be nothing to he hope that raffles be not ill ""he be quite well when see he this morning answer her brother and they relapse into silence while the rain patter against the window and the wind scream amid the branch of the elm outside old mcintyre have sit in the corner most of the day bite his nail and glower into the fire with brooding malignant expression upon his wrinkle feature contrary to his usual habit he do not go to the village inn but shuffle off early to bed without word to his child laura and robert remained chat for some time by the fire she talk of the thousand and one wonderful thing which be to be do when she be mistress of the new hall there be less philanthropy in her talk when her future husband be absent and robert could not but remark that her carriage her dress her reception and her travel in distant country be the topic into which she throw all the enthusiasm which he have formerly hear she bestow upon refuge home and labour organisation "i think that grey be the nice horse she say bay be nice too but grey be more showy we could manage with brougham and landau and perhaps high dog cart for raffles he have the coach house full at present but he never use they and be sure that those fifty horse would all die for want of exercise or get liver like strasburg geese if they wait for he to ride or drive they ""i suppose that you will still live here say her brother "we must have house in london as well and run up for the season do n't of course like to make suggestion now but it will be different afterwards be sure that raffles will do it if ask he it be all very well for he to say that he do not want any thank or honour but should like to know what be the use of be public benefactor if you be to have no return for it be sure that if he do only half what he talk of do they will make he peer lord tamfield perhaps and then of course shall be my lady tamfield and what would you think of that

away as to you bob do n't know what we shall do for you we shall make you president of the royal academy if money can do it "it be late before they cease build their air castle and retire to their room but robert 's brain be excite and he could not sleep the event of the day have be enough to shake strong man there have be the revelation of the morning the strange sight which he have witness in the laboratory and the immense secret which have be confide to his keeping then there have be his conversation with his father in the afternoon their disagreement and the sudden intrusion of raffles haw finally the talk with his sister have excite his imagination and drive sleep from his eyelid in vain he turn and twist in his bed or pace the floor of his chamber he be not only awake but abnormally awake with every nerve highly string and every sense at the keen what be he to do to gain little sleep it flash across he that there be brandy in the decant downstairs and that glass might act as sedative he have open the door of his room when suddenly his ear catch the sound of slow and stealthy footstep upon the stair his own lamp be unlit but dim glimmer come from move taper and long black shadow travel down the wall he stand motionless listen intently the step be in the hall now and he hear gentle creaking as the key be cautiously turn in the door the next instant there come gust of cold air the taper be extinguish and sharp snap announce that the door have be close from without robert stand astonish who could this night wanderer be it must be his father but what errand could take he out at three in the morning and such morning too with every blast of the wind the rain beat up against his chamber window as though it would drive it in the glass rattle in the frame and the tree outside creak and groan as its great branch be toss about by the gale what could draw any man forth upon such night?hurriedly robert strike match and light his lamp his father 's room be opposite his own and the door be ajar he push it open and look about he it be empty the bed have not even be lain upon the single chair stand by the window and there the old man must have sit since he leave they there be no book no paper no means by which he could have amuse himself nothing but razor strop lying on the window sill feeling of impending misfortune strike cold to robert 's heart there be some ill meaning in this journey of his father 's he think of his brooding of yesterday his scowl face his bitter threat yes there be some mischief underlie it but perhaps he might even now be in time to prevent it there be no use call laura she could be no help in the matter he hurriedly throw on his clothe muffle himself in his top coat and seize his hat and stick he set off after his father as he come out into the village street the wind whirl down it so that he have to put his ear and shoulder against it and push his way forward it be well however when he turn into the lane the high bank and the hedge shelter he upon one side the road however be deep in mud and the rain fall in steady swish not soul be to be see but he need to make no inquiry for he know whither his father have go as certainly as though he have see he the iron side gate of the avenue be half open and robert stumble his way up the gravel drive amid the dripping fir tree what could his father 's intention be when he reach the hall be it merely that he wish to spy and prowl or do he intend to call up the master and enter into some discussion as to his wrong or be it possible that some blacker and more sinister design lie beneath his strange doing robert think suddenly of the razor strop and gasp with horror what have the old man be do with that he quicken his pace to run and hurry on until he find himself at the door of the hall thank god all be quiet there he stand by the big silent door and listen intently there be nothing to be hear save the wind and the rain where then could his father be if he wish to enter the hall he would not attempt to do so by one of the window for have he not be present when raffles haw have show they the precaution which he have take but then sudden thought strike robert there be one window which be leave unguarded haw have be imprudent enough to tell they so it be the middle window of the laboratory if he remember it so clearly of course his father would remember it too there be the point of danger the moment that he have come round the corner of the building he find that his surmise have be correct an electric lamp burn in the laboratory and the silver square of the three large window stand out clear and bright in the darkness the centre one have be throw open and even as he gaze robert see dark monkey like figure spring up on to the sill and vanish into the room beyond for moment only it outline itself against the brilliant light beyond but in that moment robert have space to see that it be indeed his father on tiptoe he cross the intervene space and peep in through the open window it be singular spectacle which meet his eye there stand upon the glass table some half dozen large ingot of gold which have be make the night before but which have not be remove to the treasure house on these the old man have throw himself as one who enter into his rightful inheritance he lie across the table his arm clasp the bar of gold his cheek press against they croon and mutter to himself under the clear still light amid the giant wheel and strange engine that one little dark figure clutch and cling to the ingot have in it something both weird and piteous for five minute or more robert stand in the darkness amid the rain look in at this strange sight while his father hardly move save to cuddle close to the gold and to pat it with his thin hand robert be still uncertain what he should do when his eye wander from the central figure and fall on something else which make he give little cry of astonishment cry which be drown amid the howling of the gale raffles haw be stand in the corner of the room where he have come from robert could not say but he be certain that he have not be there when he first look in he stand silent wrap in some long dark dressing gown his arm fold and bitter smile upon his pale face old mcintyre seem to see he at almost the same moment for he snarl out an oath and clutch still close at his treasure look slantwise at the master of the house with furtive treacherous eye "and it have really come to this say haw at last take step forward you have actually fall so low mr. mcintyre as to steal into my house at night like common burglar you know that this window be unguarde remember tell you as much but do not tell you what other mean have adopt by which might be warn if knave make an entrance but that you should have come you!"the old gunmaker make no attempt to justify himself but he mutter some few hoarse word and continue to cling to the treasure "i love your daughter say raffles haw and for her sake will not expose you your hideous and infamous secret shall be safe with i no ear shall hear what have happen this night will not as might arouse my servant and send for the police but you must leave my house without further word have nothing more to say to you go as you have come "he take step forward and hold out his hand as if to detach the old man 's grasp from the golden bar the other thrust his hand into the breast of his coat and with shrill scream of rage fling himself upon the alchemist so sudden and so fierce be the movement that haw have no time for defence bony hand grip he by the throat and the blade of razor flash in the air fortunately as it fall the weapon strike against one of the many wire which span the room and fly out of the old man 's grasp tinkle upon the stone floor but though disarm he be still dangerous with horrible silent energy he push haw back and back until come to bench they both fall over it mcintyre remain uppermost his other hand be on the alchemist 's throat and it might have fare ill with he have robert not climb through the window and drag his father off from he with the aid of haw he pin the old man down and pass long cravat around his arm it be terrible to look at he for his face be convulse his eye bulge from his head and his lip white with foam haw lean against the glass table pant with his hand to his side "you here robert he gasp be it not horrible how do you come?""i follow he hear he go out ""he would have rob i and he would have murder i but he be mad stark stare mad!"there could be no doubt of it old mcintyre be sit up now and burst suddenly into hoarse peal of laughter rock himself backwards and forwards and look up at they with little twinkling cunning eye it be clear to both of they that his mind weaken by long brood over the one idea have now at last become that of monomaniac his horrid causeless mirth be more terrible even than his fury "what shall we do with he ask haw we can not take he back to elmdene it would be terrible shock to laura ""we could have doctor to certify in the morning could we not keep he here until then if we take he back some one will meet we and there will be scandal ""i know we will take he to one of the padded room where he can neither hurt himself nor anyone else be somewhat shake myself but be well now do you take one arm and will take the other "half lead and half drag he they manage between they to convey the old gunmaker away from the scene of his disaster and to lodge he for the night in place of safety at five in the morning robert have start in the gig to make the medical arrangement while raffles haw pace his palatial house with troubled face and sad heart it may be that laura do not look upon the removal of her father as an unmixed misfortune nothing be say to she as to the manner of the old man 's seizure but robert inform she at breakfast that he have think it well act under medical advice to place he for time under some restraint she have herself frequently remark upon the grow eccentricity of his manner so that the announcement could have be no great surprise to she it be certain that it do not diminish her appetite for the coffee and the scramble egg nor prevent she from chat good deal about she approach wedding but it be very different with raffles haw the incident have shock he to his inmost soul he have often fear lest his money should do indirect evil but here be crime and madness arise before his very eye from its influence in vain he try to choke down his feeling and to persuade himself that this attack of old mcintyre 's be something which come of itself something which have no connection with himself or his wealth he remember the man as he have first meet he garrulous foolish but with no obvious vice he recall the change which week by week have come over he his greedy eye his furtive manner his hint and innuendo end only the day before in positive demand for money it be too certain that there be chain of event there lead direct to the horrible encounter in the laboratory his money have cast blight where he have hope to shed blessing mr. spurling the vicar be up shortly after breakfast some rumour of evil having come to his ear it be good for haw to talk with he for the fresh breezy manner of the old clergyman be corrective to his own sombre and introspective mood "prut tut say he this be very bad very bad indeed mind unhinge you say and not likely to get over it dear dear have notice change in he these last few week he look like man who have something upon his mind and how be mr. robert mcintyre?""he be very well he be with i this morning when his father have this attack ""ha there be change in that young man observe an alteration in he you will forgive i mr. raffles haw if say few serious word of advice to you apart from my spiritual function be old enough to be your father you be very wealthy man and you have use your wealth nobly yes sir nobly do not think that there be man in thousand who would have do as well but do n't you think sometimes that it have dangerous influence upon those who be around you?""i have sometimes fear so we may pass over old mr. mcintyre it would hardly be just perhaps to mention he in this connection but there be robert he use to take such an interest in his profession he be so keen about art if you meet he the first word he say be usually some reference to his plan or the progress he be make in his late picture he be ambitious push self reliant now he do nothing know for fact that it be two month since he put
