march 24 the spring be fairly with we now outside my laboratory window the great chestnut tree be all cover with the big glutinous gummy bud some of which have already begin to break into little green shuttlecock as you walk down the lane you be conscious of the rich silent force of nature work all around you the wet earth smell fruitful and luscious green shoot be peep out everywhere the twig be stiff with their sap and the moist heavy english air be laden with faintly resinous perfume bud in the hedge lamb beneath they everywhere the work of reproduction go forward!i can see it without and can feel it within we also have our spring when the little arteriole dilate the lymph flow in brisker stream the gland work hard winnow and strain every year nature readjust the whole machine can feel the ferment in my blood at this very moment and as the cool sunshine pour through my window could dance about in it like gnat so should only that charles sadler would rush upstairs to know what be the matter besides must remember that be professor gilroy an old professor may afford to be natural but when fortune have give one of the first chair in the university to man of four and thirty he must try and act the part consistently what fellow wilson be if could only throw the same enthusiasm into physiology that he do into psychology should become claude bernard at the least his whole life and soul and energy work to one end he drop to sleep collate his result of the past day and he wake to plan his research for the come one and yet outside the narrow circle who follow his proceeding he get so little credit for it physiology be recognize science if add even brick to the edifice every one see and applaud it but wilson be try to dig the foundation for science of the future his work be underground and do not show yet he go on uncomplainingly correspond with hundred semi maniacs in the hope of find one reliable witness sift hundred lie on the chance of gain one little speck of truth collate old book devouring new one experiment lecturing try to light up in other the fiery interest which be consume he be fill with wonder and admiration when think of he and yet when he ask i to associate myself with his research be compel to tell he that in their present state they offer little attraction to man who be devoted to exact science if he could show i something positive and objective might then be tempt to approach the question from its physiological side so long as half his subject be taint with charlatanerie and the other half with hysteria we physiologist must content ourselves with the body and leave the mind to our descendant no doubt be materialist agatha say that be rank one tell she that be an excellent reason for shorten our engagement since be in such urgent need of her spirituality and yet may claim to be curious example of the effect of education upon temperament for by nature be unless deceive myself highly psychic man be nervous sensitive boy dreamer somnambulist full of impression and intuition my black hair my dark eye my thin olive face my taper finger be all characteristic of my real temperament and cause expert like wilson to claim i as their own but my brain be soak with exact knowledge have train myself to deal only with fact and with proof surmise and fancy have no place in my scheme of thought show i what can see with my microscope cut with my scalpel weigh in my balance and will devote lifetime to its investigation but when you ask i to study feeling impression suggestion you ask i to do what be distasteful and even demoralize departure from pure reason affect i like an evil smell or musical discord which be very sufficient reason why be little loath to go to professor wilson 's tonight still feel that could hardly get out of the invitation without positive rudeness and now that mrs. marden and agatha be go of course would not if could but have rather meet they anywhere else know that wilson would draw i into this nebulous semi science of his if he could in his enthusiasm he be perfectly impervious to hint or remonstrance nothing short of positive quarrel will make he realize my aversion to the whole business have no doubt that he have some new mesmerist or clairvoyant or medium or trickster of some sort whom he be go to exhibit to we for even his entertainment bear upon his hobby well it will be treat for agatha at any rate she be interested in it as woman usually be in whatever be vague and mystical and indefinite.10.50 p. m. this diary keeping of mine be fancy the outcome of that scientific habit of mind about which write this morning like to register impression while they be fresh once day at least endeavor to define my own mental position it be useful piece of self analysis and have fancy steadying effect upon the character frankly must confess that my own need what stiffen can give it fear that after all much of my neurotic temperament survive and that be far from that cool calm precision which characterize murdoch or pratt haldane otherwise why should the tomfoolery which have witness this evening have set my nerve thrill so that even now be all unstrung my only comfort be that neither wilson nor miss penclosa nor even agatha could have possibly know my weakness and what in the world be there to excite i nothing or so little that it will seem ludicrous when set it down the mardens get to wilson 's before i in fact be one of the last to arrive and find the room crowd have hardly time to say word to mrs. marden and to agatha who be look charming in white and pink with glitter wheat ear in her hair when wilson came twitch at my sleeve "you want something positive gilroy say he draw i apart into corner my dear fellow have phenomenon phenomenon!"i should have be more impressed have not hear the same before his sanguine spirit turn every fire fly into star "no possible question about the bona fide this time say he in answer perhaps to some little gleam of amusement in my eye my wife have know she for many year they both come from trinidad you know miss penclosa have only be in england month or two and know no one outside the university circle but assure you that the thing she have tell we suffice in themselves to establish clairvoyance upon an absolutely scientific basis there be nothing like she amateur or professional come and be introduced!"i like none of these mystery monger but the amateur least of all with the pay performer you may pounce upon he and expose he the instant that you have see through his trick he be there to deceive you and you be there to find he out but what be you to do with the friend of your host 's wife be you to turn on light suddenly and expose she slap surreptitious banjo or be you to hurl cochineal over her evening frock when she steal round with her phosphorus bottle and her supernatural platitude there would be scene and you would be look upon as brute so you have your choice of be that or dupe be in no very good humor as follow wilson to the lady any one less like my idea of west indian could not be imagine she be small frail creature well over forty should say with pale peaky face and hair of very light shade of chestnut her presence be insignificant and her manner retire in any group of ten woman she would have be the last whom one would have pick out her eye be perhaps her most remarkable and also be compel to say her least pleasant feature they be gray in color gray with shade of green and their expression strike i as be decidedly furtive wonder if furtive be the word or should have say fierce on second thought feline would have express it well crutch lean against the wall tell i what be painfully evident when she rise that one of her leg be crippled so be introduce to miss penclosa and it do not escape i that as my name be mention she glance across at agatha wilson have evidently be talk and presently no doubt think she will inform i by occult mean that be engaged to young lady with wheat ear in her hair wonder how much more wilson have be tell she about i "professor gilroy be terrible sceptic say he hope miss penclosa that you will be able to convert he "she look keenly up at i "professor gilroy be quite right to be sceptical if he have not see any thing convincing say she should have think she add that you would yourself have be an excellent subject ""for what may ask say i."well for mesmerism for example ""my experience have be that mesmerist go for their subject to those who be mentally unsound all their result be vitiate as it seem to i by the fact that they be deal with abnormal organism ""which of these lady would you say possess normal organism she ask should like you to select the one who seem to you to have the good balanced mind should we say the girl in pink and white miss agatha marden think the name be ""yes should attach weight to any result from she ""i have never try how far she be impressionable of course some people respond much more rapidly than other may ask how far your scepticism extend suppose that you admit the mesmeric sleep and the power of suggestion ""i admit nothing miss penclosa ""dear i think science have get furth than that of course know nothing about the scientific side of it only know what can do you see the girl in red for example over near the japanese jar shall will that she come across to we "she bend forward as she speak and drop her fan upon the floor the girl whisk round and come straight toward we with an enquire look upon her face as if some one have call she "what do you think of that gilroy cry wilson in kind of ecstasy do not dare to tell he what think of it to i it be the most bareface shameless piece of imposture that have ever witness the collusion and the signal have really be too obvious "professor gilroy be not satisfied say she glance up at i with her strange little eye my poor fan be to get the credit of that experiment well we must try something else miss marden would you have any objection to my put you off?""oh should love it cry agatha by this time all the company have gather round we in circle the shirt front man and the white throate woman some awed some critical as though it be something between religious ceremony and conjurer 's entertainment red velvet arm chair have be push into the centre and agatha lie back in it little flushed and tremble slightly from excitement could see it from the vibration of the wheat ear miss penclosa rise from her seat and stand over she lean upon her crutch and there be change in the woman she no long seem small or insignificant twenty year be go from her age her eye be shine tinge of color have come into her sallow cheek her whole figure have expand so have see dull eyed listless lad change in an instant into briskness and life when give task of which he feel himself master she look down at agatha with an expression which resent from the bottom of my soul the expression with which roman empress might have look at her kneeling slave then with quick command gesture she toss up her arm and sweep they slowly down in front of she be watch agatha narrowly during three pass she seem to be simply amused at the fourth observe slight glazing of her eye accompany by some dilation of her pupil at the sixth there be momentary rigor at the seventh her lid begin to droop at the tenth her eye be close and her breathing be slow and full than usual try as watch to preserve my scientific calm but foolish causeless agitation convulse i trust that hide it but feel as child feel in the dark could not have believe that be still open to such weakness "she be in the trance say miss penclosa "she be sleep cry "wake she then!"i pull she by the arm and shout in her ear she might have be dead for all the impression that could make her body be there on the velvet chair her organ be act her heart her lung but her soul it have slip from beyond our ken whither have it go what power have dispossess it be puzzle and disconcert "so much for the mesmeric sleep say miss penclosa as regard suggestion whatever may suggest miss marden will infallibly do whether it be now or after she have awaken from her trance do you demand proof of it?""certainly say i."you shall have it see smile pass over her face as though an amusing thought have strike she she stoop and whisper earnestly into her subject 's ear agatha who have be so deaf to i nod her head as she listen "awake cry miss penclosa with sharp tap of her crutch upon the floor the eye open the glazing clear slowly away and the soul look out once more after its strange eclipse we go away early agatha be none the bad for her strange excursion but be nervous and unstrung unable to listen to or answer the stream of comment which wilson be pour out for my benefit as bid her good night miss penclosa slip piece of paper into my hand "pray forgive i say she if take mean to overcome your scepticism open this note at ten o'clock to morrow morning it be little private test "i ca n't imagine what she mean but there be the note and it shall be open as she direct my head be ache and have write enough for to night to morrow dare say that what seem so inexplicable will take quite another complexion shall not surrender my conviction without struggle march 25 be amazed confounded it be clear that must reconsider my opinion upon this matter but first let i place on record what have occur have finish breakfast and be look over some diagram with which my lecture be to be illustrate when my housekeeper enter to tell i that agatha be in my study and wish to see i immediately glance at the clock and see with sun rise that it be only half past nine when enter the room she be stand on the hearth rug face i something in her pose chill i and check the word which be rise to my lip her veil be half down but could see that she be pale and that her expression be constrain "austin she say have come to tell you that our engagement be at an end "i stagger believe that literally do stagger know that find myself lean against the bookcase for support "but but stammer this be very sudden agatha ""yes austin have come here to tell you that our engagement be at an end ""but surely cry you will give i some reason this be unlike you agatha tell i how have be unfortunate enough to offend you ""it be all over austin ""but why you must be under some delusion agatha perhaps you have be tell some falsehood about i or you may have misunderstood something that have say to you only let i know what it be and word may set it all right ""we must consider it all at an end ""but you leave i last night without hint at any disagreement what could have occur in the interval to change you so it must have be something that happen last night you have be think it over and you have disapprove of my conduct be it the mesmerism do you blame i for let that woman exercise her power over you you know that at the least sign should have interfere ""it be useless austin all be over:"her voice be cold and measure her manner strangely formal and hard it seem to i that she be absolutely resolve not to be draw into any argument or explanation as for i be shake with agitation and turn my face aside so ashamed be that she should see my want of control "you must know what this mean to i cry it be the blasting of all my hope and the ruin of my life you surely will not inflict such punishment upon i unheard you will let i know what be the matter consider how impossible it would be for i under any circumstance to treat you so for god 's sake agatha let i know what have done!"she walk past i without word and open the door "it be quite useless austin say she you must consider our engagement at an end an instant later she be go and before could recover myself sufficiently to follow she hear the hall door close behind she rush into my room to change my coat with the idea of hurry round to mrs. marden 's to learn from she what the cause of my misfortune might be so shake be that could hardly lace my boot never shall forget those horrible ten minute have just pull on my overcoat when the clock upon the mantel piece strike ten ten associate the idea with miss penclosa 's note it be lie before i on the table and tear it open it be scribble in pencil in peculiarly angular handwriting "my dear professor gilroy it say pray excuse the personal nature of the test which be give you professor wilson happen to mention the relation between you and my subject of this evening and it strike i that nothing could be more convincing to you than if be to suggest to miss marden that she should call upon you at half past nine to morrow morning and suspend your engagement for half an hour or so science be so exact that it be difficult to give satisfying test but be convinced that this at least will be an action which she would be most unlikely to do of her own free will forget any thing that she may have say as she have really nothing whatever to do with it and will certainly not recollect any thing about it write this note to shorten your anxiety and to beg you to forgive i for the momentary unhappiness which my suggestion must have cause you "yours faithfully;"helen penclosa.really when have read the note be too relieved to be angry it be liberty certainly it be very great liberty indeed on the part of lady whom have only meet once but after all have challenge she by my scepticism it may have be as she say little difficult to devise test which would satisfy i and she have do that there could be no question at all upon the point for i hypnotic suggestion be finally establish it take its place from now onward as one of the fact of life that agatha who of all woman of my acquaintance have the good balanced mind have be reduce to condition of automatism appear to be certain person at distance have work she as an engineer on the shore might guide brennan torpedo second soul have step in as it be have push her own aside and have seize her nervous mechanism say will work this for half an hour and agatha must have be unconscious as she come and as she return could she make her way in safety through the street in such state put on my hat and hurried round to see if all be well with she yes she be at home be show into the drawing room and find she sit with book upon her lap "you be an early visitor austin say she smile "and you have be an even early one answer she look puzzled what do you mean she ask "you have not be out to day?""no certainly not ""agatha say seriously would you mind tell i exactly what you have do this morning?"she laugh at my earnestness "you've get on your professional look austin see what come of be engage to man of science however will tell you though ca n't imagine what you want to know for get up at eight breakfast at half past come into this room at ten minute past nine and begin to read the memoirs of mme de remusat in few minute do the french lady the bad compliment of drop to sleep over her page and do you sir the very flattering one of dream about you it be only few minute since wake up ""and find yourself where you have be before?""why where else should find myself?""would you mind tell i agatha what it be that you dream about i it really be not mere curiosity on my part ""i merely have vague impression that you come into it can not recall any thing definite ""if you have not be out to day agatha how be it that your shoe be dusty?"a pained look come over her face "really austin do not know what be the matter with you this morning one would almost think that you doubt my word if my boot be dusty it must be of course that have put on pair which the maid have not clean "it be perfectly evident that she know nothing whatever about the matter and reflect that after all perhaps it be well that should not enlighten she it might frighten she and could serve no good purpose that could see say no more about it therefore and leave shortly afterward to give my lecture but be immensely impressed my horizon of scientific possibility have suddenly be enormously extend no long wonder at wilson 's demonic energy and enthusiasm who would not work hard who have vast virgin field ready to his hand why have know the novel shape of nucleolus or trifling peculiarity of stripe muscular fibre see under 300 diameter lens fill i with exultation how petty do such research seem when compare with this one which strike at the very root of life and the nature of the soul have always look upon spirit as product of matter the brain think secrete the mind as the liver do the bile but how can this be when see mind work from distance and play upon matter as musician might upon violin the body do not give rise to the soul then but be rather the rough instrument by which the spirit manifest itself the windmill do not give rise to the wind but only indicate it it be opposed to my whole habit of thought and yet it be undeniably possible and worthy of investigation and why should not investigate it see that under yesterday 's date say if could see something positive and objective might be tempt to approach it from the physiological aspect well have get my test shall be as good as my word the investigation would be sure be of immense interest some of my colleague might look askance at it for science be full of unreasoning prejudice but if wilson have the courage of his conviction can afford to have it also shall go to he to morrow
