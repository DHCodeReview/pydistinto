morning to he and to miss penclosa if she can show we so much it be probable that she can show we more march 26 wilson be as have anticipate very exultant over my conversion and miss penclosa be also demurely pleased at the result of her experiment strange what silent colorless creature she be save only when she exercise her power even talk about it give her color and life she seem to take singular interest in i can not help observe how her eye follow i about the room we have the most interesting conversation about her own power it be just as well to put her view on record though they can not of course claim any scientific weight "you be on the very fringe of the subject say she when have express wonder at the remarkable instance of suggestion which she have show i have no direct influence upon miss marden when she come round to you be not even think of she that morning what do be to set her mind as might set the alarum of clock so that at the hour name it would go off of its own accord if six month instead of twelve hour have be suggest it would have be the same ""and if the suggestion have be to assassinate me?""she would most inevitably have do so ""but this be terrible power cry "it be as you say terrible power she answer gravely and the more you know of it the more terrible will it seem to you ""may ask say what you mean when you say that this matter of suggestion be only at the fringe of it what do you consider the essential?""i have rather not tell you "i be surprised at the decision of her answer "you understand say that it be not out of curiosity ask but in the hope that may find some scientific explanation for the fact with which you furnish i ""frankly professor gilroy say she be not at all interested in science nor do care whether it can or can not classify these power ""but be hope ah that be quite another thing if you make it personal matter say she with the pleasantest of smile shall be only too happy to tell you any thing you wish to know let i see what be it you ask i oh about the further power professor wilson wo n't believe in they but they be quite true all the same for example it be possible for an operator to gain complete command over his subject presume that the latter be good one without any previous suggestion he may make he do whatever he like ""without the subject 's knowledge?""that depend if the force be strongly exert he would know no more about it than miss marden do when she come round and frighten you so or if the influence be less powerful he might be conscious of what he be do but be quite unable to prevent himself from do it ""would he have lose his own will power then?""it would be over ride by another strong one ""have you ever exercise this power yourself?""several time ""is your own will so strong then?""well it do not entirely depend upon that many have strong will which be not detachable from themselves the thing be to have the gift of project it into another person and supersede his own find that the power vary with my own strength and health ""practically you send your soul into another person 's body ""well you might put it that way ""and what do your own body do?""it merely feel lethargic ""well but be there no danger to your own health ask "there might be little you have to be careful never to let your own consciousness absolutely go otherwise you might experience some difficulty in find your way back again you must always preserve the connection as it be be afraid express myself very badly professor gilroy but of course do n't know how to put these thing in scientific way be just give you my own experience and my own explanation "well read this over now at my leisure and marvel at myself be this austin gilroy the man who have win his way to the front by his hard reasoning power and by his devotion to fact here be gravely retail the gossip of woman who tell i how her soul may be project from her body and how while she lie in lethargy she can control the action of people at distance do accept it certainly not she must prove and re prove before yield point but if be still sceptic have at least cease to be scoffer we be to have sitting this evening and she be to try if she can produce any mesmeric effect upon i if she can it will make an excellent starting point for our investigation no one can accuse i at any rate of complicity if she can not we must try and find some subject who will be like caesar 's wife wilson be perfectly impervious.10 p. m. believe that be on the threshold of an epoch make investigation to have the power of examine these phenomenon from inside to have an organism which will respond and at the same time brain which will appreciate and criticise that be surely unique advantage be quite sure that wilson would give five year of his life to be as susceptible as have prove myself to be there be no one present except wilson and his wife be seat with my head lean back and miss penclosa stand in front and little to the left use the same long sweeping stroke as with agatha at each of they warm current of air seem to strike i and to suffuse thrill and glow all through i from head to foot my eye be fix upon miss penclosa 's face but as gaze the feature seem to blur and to fade away be conscious only of her own eye look down at i gray deep inscrutable larger they grow and large until they change suddenly into two mountain lake toward which seem to be fall with horrible rapidity shudder and as do so some deep stratum of thought tell i that the shudder represent the rigor which have observe in agatha an instant later strike the surface of the lake now join into one and down go beneath the water with fulness in my head and buzzing in my ear down go down down and then with swoop up again until could see the light stream brightly through the green water be almost at the surface when the word awake ring through my head and with start find myself back in the arm chair with miss penclosa lean on her crutch and wilson his note book in his hand peep over her shoulder no heaviness or weariness be leave behind on the contrary though it be only an hour or so since the experiment feel so wakeful that be more inclined for my study than my bedroom see quite vista of interesting experiment extend before we and be all impatience to begin upon they march 27 blank day as miss penclosa go with wilson and his wife to the suttons have begin binet and ferre 's animal magnetism what strange deep water these be result result result and the cause an absolute mystery it be stimulate to the imagination but must be on my guard against that let we have no inference nor deduction and nothing but solid fact know that the mesmeric trance be true know that mesmeric suggestion be true know that be myself sensitive to this force that be my present position have large new note book which shall be devote entirely to scientific detail long talk with agatha and mrs. marden in the evening about our marriage we think that the summer vac the beginning of it would be the good time for the wedding why should we delay grudge even those few month still as mrs. marden say there be good many thing to be arrange march 28 mesmerize again by miss penclosa experience much the same as before save that insensibility come on more quickly see note book for temperature of room barometric pressure pulse and respiration as take by professor wilson march 29 mesmerize again detail in note book a.march 30 sunday and blank day grudge any interruption of our experiment at present they merely embrace the physical sign which go with slight with complete and with extreme insensibility afterward we hope to pass on to the phenomena of suggestion and of lucidity professor have demonstrate these thing upon woman at nancy and at the salpetriere it will be more convincing when woman demonstrate it upon professor with second professor as witness and that should be the subject the sceptic the materialist at least have show that my devotion to science be great than to my own personal consistency the eating of our own word be the great sacrifice which truth ever require of we my neighbor charles sadler the handsome young demonstrator of anatomy come in this evening to return volume of virchow 's archives which have lend he call he young but as matter of fact he be year old than be "i understand gilroy say he that you be be experiment upon by miss penclosa ""well he go on when have acknowledge it if be you should not let it go any far you will think i very impertinent no doubt but none the less feel it to be my duty to advise you to have no more to do with she "of course ask he why "i be so place that can not enter into particular as freely as could wish say he miss penclosa be the friend of my friend and my position be delicate one can only say this that have myself be the subject of some of the woman 's experiment and that they have leave most unpleasant impression upon my mind "he could hardly expect i to be satisfied with that and try hard to get something more definite out of he but without success be it conceivable that he could be jealous at my having supersede he or be he one of those man of science who feel personally injure when fact run counter to their preconceived opinion he can not seriously suppose that because he have some vague grievance be therefore to abandon series of experiment which promise to be so fruitful of result he appear to be annoy at the light way in which treat his shadowy warning and we part with some little coldness on both side march 31 mesmerize by miss p.april mesmerize by miss p. note book a.)april mesmerize by miss p. sphygmographic chart take by professor wilson.)april it be possible that this course of mesmerism may be little try to the general constitution agatha say that be thin and dark under the eye be conscious of nervous irritability which have not observe in myself before the least noise for example make i start and the stupidity of student cause i exasperation instead of amusement agatha wish i to stop but tell she that every course of study be try and that one can never attain result with out pay some price for it when she see the sensation which my forthcoming paper on the relation between mind and matter may make she will understand that it be worth little nervous wear and tear should not be surprised if get my f. r. s. over it mesmerize again in the evening the effect be produce more rapidly now and the subjective vision be less marked keep full note of each sit wilson be leave for town for week or ten day but we shall not interrupt the experiment which depend for their value as much upon my sensation as on his observation april must be carefully on my guard complication have creep into our experiment which have not reckon upon in my eagerness for scientific fact have be foolishly blind to the human relation between miss penclosa and myself can write here what would not breathe to live soul the unhappy woman appear to have form an attachment for i should not say such thing even in the privacy of my own intimate journal if it have not come to such pass that it be impossible to ignore it for some time that is for the last week there have be sign which have brush aside and refuse to think of her brightness when come her dejection when go her eagerness that should come often the expression of her eye the tone of her voice try to think that they mean nothing and be perhaps only her ardent west indian manner but last night as awake from the mesmeric sleep put out my hand unconsciously involuntarily and clasp hers when come fully to myself we be sit with they lock she look up at i with an expectant smile and the horrible thing be that feel impel to say what she expect i to say what false wretch should have be how should have loathe myself to day have yield to the temptation of that moment but thank god be strong enough to spring up and hurry from the room be rude fear but could not no could not trust myself another moment gentleman man of honor engage to one of the sweet girl in england and yet in moment of reasonless passion nearly profess love for this woman whom hardly know she be far old than myself and cripple it be monstrous odious and yet the impulse be so strong that have stay another minute in her presence should have commit myself what be it have to teach other the working of our organism and what do know of it myself be it the sudden upcropping of some low stratum in my nature brutal primitive instinct suddenly assert itself could almost believe the tale of obsession by evil spirit so overmastering be the feeling well the incident place i in most unfortunate position on the one hand be very loath to abandon series of experiment which have already go so far and which promise such brilliant result on the other if this unhappy woman have conceive passion for i but surely even now must have make some hideous mistake she with her age and her deformity it be impossible and then she know about agatha she understand how be place she only smile out of amusement perhaps when in my daze state seize her hand it be my half mesmerized brain which give it meaning and spring with such bestial swiftness to meet it wish could persuade myself that it be indeed so on the whole perhaps my wise plan would be to postpone our other experiment until wilson 's return have write note to miss penclosa therefore make no allusion to last night but say that press of work would cause i to interrupt our sitting for few day she have answer formally enough to say that if should change my mind should find she at home at the usual hour.10 p. m. well well what thing of straw be be come to know myself well of late and the more know the low fall in my own estimation surely be not always so weak as this at four o'clock should have smile have any one tell i that should go to miss penclosa 's to night and yet at eight be at wilson 's door as usual do n't know how it occur the influence of habit suppose perhaps there be mesmeric craze as there be an opium craze and be victim to it only know that as work in my study become more and more uneasy fidget worry could not concentrate my mind upon the paper in front of i and then at last almost before know what be do seize my hat and hurried round to keep my usual appointment we have an interesting evening mrs. wilson be present during most of the time which prevent the embarrassment which one at least of we must have feel miss penclosa 's manner be quite the same as usual and she express no surprise at my having come in spite of my note there be nothing in her bearing to show that yesterday 's incident have make any impression upon she and so be inclined to hope that overrate it april evening no no no do not overrate it can no long attempt to conceal from myself that this woman have conceive passion for i it be monstrous but it be true again tonight awake from the mesmeric trance to find my hand in hers and to suffer that odious feeling which urge i to throw away my honor my career every thing for the sake of this creature who as can plainly see when be away from her influence possess no single charm upon earth but when be near she do not feel this she rouse something in i something evil something have rather not think of she paralyze my well nature too at the moment when she stimulate my bad decidedly it be not good for i to be near she last night be bad than before instead of fly actually sit for some time with my hand in hers talk over the most intimate subject with she we speak of agatha among other thing what could have be dream of miss penclosa say that she be conventional and agree with she she speak once or twice in disparaging way of she and do not protest what creature have been!weak as have prove myself to be be still strong enough to bring this sort of thing to an end it shall not happen again have sense enough to fly when can not fight from this sunday night onward shall never sit with miss penclosa again never let the experiment go let the research come to an end any thing be well than face this monstrous temptation which drag i so low have say nothing to miss penclosa but shall simply stay away she can tell the reason without any word of mine april have stay away as say it be pity to ruin such an interesting investigation but it would be great pity still to ruin my life and know that can not trust myself with that woman.11 p. m. god help i what be the matter with i be go mad let i try and be calm and reason with myself first of all shall set down exactly what occur it be nearly eight when write the line with which this day begin feel strangely restless and uneasy leave my room and walk round to spend the evening with agatha and her mother they both remark that be pale and haggard about nine professor pratt haldane come in and we play game of whist try hard to concentrate my attention upon the card but the feeling of restlessness grow and grow until find it impossible to struggle against it simply could not sit still at the table at last in the very middle of hand throw my card down and with some sort of an incoherent apology about have an appointment rush from the room as if in dream have vague recollection of tear through the hall snatch my hat from the stand and slam the door behind i as in dream too have the impression of the double line of gas lamp and my bespatter boot tell i that must have run down the middle of the road it be all misty and strange and unnatural come to wilson 's house see mrs. wilson and see miss penclosa hardly recall what we talk about but do remember that miss p. shake the head of her crutch at i in playful way and accuse i of be late and of lose interest in our experiment there be no mesmerism but stay some time and have only just return my brain be quite clear again now and can think over what have occur it be absurd to suppose that it be merely weakness and force of habit try to explain it in that way the other night but it will no long suffice it be something much deep and more terrible than that why when be at the mardens whist table be drag away as if the noose of rope have be cast round i can no long disguise it from myself the woman have her grip upon i be in her clutch but must keep my head and reason it out and see what be good to be do but what blind fool have be in my enthusiasm over my research have walk straight into the pit although it lay gape before i do she not herself warn i do she not tell i as can read in my own journal that when she have acquire power over subject she can make he do she will and she have acquire that power over i be for the moment at the beck and call of this creature with the crutch must come when she will it must do as she will bad of all must feel as she will loathe she and fear she yet while be under the spell she can doubtless make i love she there be some consolation in the thought then that those odious impulse for which have blame myself do not really come from i at all they be all transfer from she little as could have guess it at the time feel clean and light for the thought april yes now in broad daylight write coolly and with time for reflection be compel to confirm every thing which write in my journal last night be in horrible position but above all must not lose my head must pit my intellect against her power after all be no silly puppet to dance at the end of string have energy brain courage for all her devil 's trick may beat she yet may must or what be to become of me?let i try to reason it out this woman by her own explanation can dominate my nervous organism she can project herself into my body and take command of it she have parasite soul yes she be parasite monstrous parasite she creep into my frame as the hermit crab do into the whelk 's shell be powerless what can do be deal with force of which know nothing and can tell no one of my trouble they would set i down as madman certainly if it got noise abroad the university would say that they have no need of devil ridden professor and agatha no no must face it alone read over my note of what the woman say when she speak about her power there be one point which fill i with dismay she imply that when the influence be slight the subject know what he be do but can not control himself whereas when it be strongly exert he be absolutely unconscious now have always know what do though less so last night than on the previous occasion that seem to mean that she have never yet exert her full power upon i be ever man so place before?yes perhaps there be and very near i too charles sadler must know something of this his vague word of warning take meaning now oh if have only listen to he then before help by these repeat sitting to forge the link of the chain which bind i but will see he to day will apologize to he for having treat his warning so lightly will see if he can advise me.4 p. m. no he can not have talk with he and
