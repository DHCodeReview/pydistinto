he show such surprise at the first word in which try to express my unspeakable secret that go no far as far as can gather by hint and inference rather than by any statement his own experience be limit to some word or look such as have myself endure his abandonment of miss penclosa be in itself sign that he be never really in her toil oh if he only know his escape he have to thank his phlegmatic saxon temperament for it be black and celtic and this hag 's clutch be deep in my nerve shall ever get it out shall ever be the same man that be just one short fortnight ago?let i consider what have well do can not leave the university in the middle of the term if be free my course would be obvious should start at once and travel in persia but would she allow i to start and could her influence not reach i in persia and bring i back to within touch of her crutch can only find out the limit of this hellish power by my own bitter experience will fight and fight and fight and what can do more?i know very well that about eight o'clock to night that crave for her society that irresistible restlessness will come upon i how shall overcome it what shall do must make it impossible for i to leave the room shall lock the door and throw the key out of the window but then what be to do in the morning never mind about the morning must at all cost break this chain which hold i april victory have do splendidly at seven o'clock last night take hasty dinner and then lock myself up in my bedroom and drop the key into the garden choose cheery novel and lie in bed for three hour try to read it but really in horrible state of trepidation expect every instant that should become conscious of the impulse nothing of the sort occur however and awake this morning with the feeling that black nightmare have be lift off i perhaps the creature realize what have do and understand that it be useless to try to influence i at any rate have beat she once and if can do it once can do it again it be most awkward about the key in the morning luckily there be an under gardener below and ask he to throw it up no doubt he think have just drop it will have door and window screw up and six stout man to hold i down in my bed before will surrender myself to be hag ride in this way have note from mrs. marden this afternoon ask i to go round and see she intend to do so in any case but have not except to find bad news wait for i it seem that the armstrongs from whom agatha have expectation be due home from adelaide in the aurora and that they have write to mrs. marden and she to meet they in town they will probably be away for month or six week and as the aurora be due on wednesday they must go at once to morrow if they be ready in time my consolation be that when we meet again there will be no more parting between agatha and i "i want you to do one thing agatha say when we be alone together if you should happen to meet miss penclosa either in town or here you must promise i never again to allow she to mesmerize you "agatha open her eye "why it be only the other day that you be say how interesting it all be and how determined you be to finish your experiment ""i know but have change my mind since then ""and you wo n't have it any more?""no ""i be so glad austin you ca n't think how pale and wear you have be lately it be really our principal objection to go to london now that we do not wish to leave you when you be so pull down and your manner have be so strange occasionally especially that night when you leave poor professor pratt haldane to play dummy be convince that these experiment be very bad for your nerve ""i think so too dear ""and for miss penclosa 's nerve as well you have hear that she be ill?""no ""mrs wilson tell we so last night she describe it as nervous fever professor wilson be come back this week and of course mrs. wilson be very anxious that miss penclosa should be well again then for he have quite programme of experiment which he be anxious to carry out "i be glad to have agatha 's promise for it be enough that this woman should have one of we in her clutch on the other hand be disturb to hear about miss penclosa 's illness it rather discount the victory which appear to win last night remember that she say that loss of health interfere with her power that may be why be able to hold my own so easily well well must take the same precaution to night and see what come of it be childishly frightened when think of she april 10 all go very well last night be amuse at the gardener 's face when have again to hail he this morning and to ask he to throw up my key shall get name among the servant if this sort of thing go on but the great point be that stay in my room without the slight inclination to leave it do believe that be shake myself clear of this incredible bond or be it only that the woman 's power be in abeyance until she recover her strength can but pray for the good the mardens leave this morning and the brightness seem to have go out of the spring sunshine and yet it be very beautiful also as it gleam on the green chestnut opposite my window and give touch of gayety to the heavy lichen mottle wall of the old college how sweet and gentle and soothing be nature who would think that there lurk in she also such vile force such odious possibility for of course understand that this dreadful thing which have spring out at i be neither supernatural nor even preternatural no it be natural force which this woman can use and society be ignorant of the mere fact that it ebb with her strength show how entirely it be subject to physical law if have time might probe it to the bottom and lay my hand upon its antidote but you can not tame the tiger when you be beneath his claws you can but try to writhe away from he ah when look in the glass and see my own dark eye and clear cut spanish face long for vitriol splash or bout of the small pox one or the other might have save i from this calamity be inclined to think that may have trouble to night there be two thing which make i fear so one be that meet mrs. wilson in the street and that she tell i that miss penclosa be well though still weak find myself wish in my heart that the illness have be she last the other be that professor wilson come back in day or two and his presence would act as constraint upon she should not fear our interview if third person be present for both these reason have presentiment of trouble to night and shall take the same precaution as before april 10 no thank god all go well last night really could not face the gardener again lock my door and thrust the key underneath it so that have to ask the maid to let i out in the morning but the precaution be really not need for never have any inclination to go out at all three evening in succession at home be surely near the end of my trouble for wilson will be home again either today or tomorrow shall tell he of what have go through or not be convinced that should not have the slight sympathy from he he would look upon i as an interesting case and read paper about i at the next meeting of the psychical society in which he would gravely discuss the possibility of my be deliberate liar and weigh it against the chance of my be in an early stage of lunacy no shall get no comfort out of wilson be feel wonderfully fit and well do n't think ever lecture with great spirit oh if could only get this shadow off my life how happy should be young fairly wealthy in the front rank of my profession engage to beautiful and charming girl have not every thing which man could ask for only one thing to trouble i but what thing it is!midnight shall go mad yes that will be the end of it shall go mad be not far from it now my head throb as rest it on my hot hand be quiver all over like scared horse oh what night have have and yet have some cause to be satisfied also at the risk of become the laugh stock of my own servant again slip my key under the door imprison myself for the night then find it too early to go to bed lie down with my clothe on and begin to read one of dumas 's novel suddenly be grip grip and drag from the couch it be only thus that can describe the overpower nature of the force which pounce upon i claw at the coverlet clung to the wood work believe that scream out in my frenzy it be all useless hopeless must go there be no way out of it it be only at the outset that resist the force soon become too overmaster for that thank goodness that there be no watcher there to interfere with i could not have answer for myself if there have be and besides the determination to get out there come to i also the keen and coolest judgment in choose my mean light candle and endeavored kneel in front of the door to pull the key through with the feather end of quill pen it be just too short and push it far away then with quiet persistence get paper knife out of one of the drawer and with that manage to draw the key back open the door step into my study take photograph of myself from the bureau write something across it place it in the inside pocket of my coat and then start off for wilson 's it be all wonderfully clear and yet disassociate from the rest of my life as the incident of even the most vivid dream might be peculiar double consciousness possess i there be the predominant alien will which be bent upon draw i to the side of its owner and there be the feebler protest personality which recognize as be myself tug feebly at the overmaster impulse as lead terri might at its chain can remember recognize these two conflict force but recall nothing of my walk nor of how be admit to the house very vivid however be my recollection of how meet miss penclosa she be recline on the sofa in the little boudoir in which our experiment have usually be carry out her head be rest on her hand and tiger skin rug have be partly draw over she she look up expectantly as enter and as the lamp light fall upon her face could see that she be very pale and thin with dark hollow under her eye she smile at i and point to stool beside she it be with her left hand that she point and run eagerly forward seize it loathe myself as think of it and press it passionately to my lip then seat myself upon the stool and still retain her hand give she the photograph which have bring with i and talk and talk and talk of my love for she of my grief over her illness of my joy at her recovery of the misery it be to i to be absent single evening from her side she lie quietly look down at i with imperious eye and her provocative smile once remember that she pass her hand over my hair as one caress dog and it give i pleasure the caress thrill under it be her slave body and soul and for the moment rejoice in my slavery and then come the bless change never tell i that there be not providence be on the brink of perdition my foot be on the edge be it coincidence that at that very instant help should come no no no there be providence and its hand have draw i back there be something in the universe strong than this devil woman with her trick ah what balm to my heart it be to think so!as look up at she be conscious of change in she her face which have be pale before be now ghastly her eye be dull and the lid droop heavily over they above all the look of serene confidence have go from her feature her mouth have weaken her forehead have pucker she be frightened and undecided and as watch the change my own spirit flutter and struggle try hard to tear itself from the grip which hold it grip which from moment to moment grow less secure "austin she whisper have try to do too much be not strong enough have not recover yet from my illness but could not live long without see you you wo n't leave i austin this be only pass weakness if you will only give i five minute shall be myself again give i the small decanter from the table in the window "but have regain my soul with her wane strength the influence have clear away from i and leave i free and be aggressive bitterly fiercely aggressive for once at least could make this woman understand what my real feeling toward she be my soul be fill with hatred as bestial as the love against which it be reaction it be the savage murderous passion of the revolt serf could have take the crutch from her side and beat her face in with it she throw her hand up as if to avoid blow and cower away from i into the corner of the settee "the brandy she gasp the brandy!"i take the decanter and pour it over the root of palm in the window then snatch the photograph from her hand and tear it into hundred piece "you vile woman say if do my duty to society you would never leave this room alive!""i love you austin love you she wail "yes cry and charles sadler before and how many other before that?""charle sadler she gasp he have speak to you so charles sadler charles sadler her voice come through her white lip like snake 's hiss "yes know you and other shall know you too you shameless creature you know how stand and yet you use your vile power to bring i to your side you may perhaps do so again but at least you will remember that you have hear i say that love miss marden from the bottom of my soul and that loathe you abhor you!"the very sight of you and the sound of your voice fill i with horror and disgust the thought of you be repulsive that be how feel toward you and if it please you by your trick to draw i again to your side as you have do to night you will at least should think have little satisfaction in try to make lover out of man who have tell you his real opinion of you you may put what word you will into my mouth but you can not help remember stop for the woman 's head have fall back and she have faint she could not bear to hear what have to say to she what glow of satisfaction it give i to think that come what may in the future she can never misunderstand my true feeling toward she but what will occur in the future what will she do next dare not think of it oh if only could hope that she will leave i alone but when think of what say to she never mind have be strong than she for once april 11 hardly sleep last night and find myself in the morning so unstrung and feverish that be compel to ask pratt haldane to do my lecture for i it be the first that have ever miss rise at mid day but my head be ache my hand quiver and my nerve in pitiable state who should come round this evening but wilson he have just come back from london where he have lecture read paper convene meeting expose medium conduct series of experiment on thought transference entertain professor richet of paris spend hour gaze into crystal and obtain some evidence as to the passage of matter through matter all this he pour into my ear in single gust "but you he cry at last you be not look well and miss penclosa be quite prostrate to day how about the experiments?""i have abandon they ""tut tut why?""the subject seem to i to be dangerous one "out come his big brown note book "this be of great interest say he what be your ground for say that it be dangerous one please give your fact in chronological order with approximate date and name of reliable witness with their permanent address ""first of all ask would you tell i whether you have collect any case where the mesmerist have gain command over the subject and have use it for evil purposes?""dozen he cry exultantly crime by suggestion do n't mean suggestion mean where sudden impulse come from person at distance an uncontrollable impulse ""obsession he shriek in an ecstasy of delight it be the rare condition we have eight case five well attested you do n't mean to say his exultation make he hardly articulate "no do n't say i. good evening you will excuse i but be not very well to night and so at last got rid of he still brandish his pencil and his note book my trouble may be bad to hear but at least it be well to hug they to myself than to have myself exhibit by wilson like freak at fair he have lose sight of human being every thing to he be case and phenomenon will die before speak to he again upon the matter april 12 yesterday be blessed day of quiet and enjoy an uneventful night wilson 's presence be great consolation what can the woman do now surely when she have hear i say what have say she will conceive the same disgust for i which have for she she could not no she could not desire to have lover who have insult she so no believe be free from her love but how about her hate might she not use these power of her for revenge tut why should frighten myself over shadow she will forget about i and shall forget about she and all will be well april 13 my nerve have quite recover their tone really believe that have conquer the creature but must confess to live in some suspense she be well again for hear that she be drive with mrs. wilson in the high street in the afternoon april 14 do wish could get away from the place altogether shall fly to agatha 's side the very day that the term close suppose it be pitiably weak of i but this woman get upon my nerve most terribly have see she again and have speak with she it be just after lunch and be smoke cigarette in my study when hear the step of my servant murray in the passage be languidly conscious that second step be audible behind and have hardly trouble myself to speculate who it might be when suddenly slight noise bring i out of my chair with my skin creep with apprehension have never particularly observe before what sort of sound the tapping of crutch be but my quiver nerve tell i that hear it now in the sharp wooden clack which alternate with the muffled thud of the foot fall another instant and my servant have show she in do not attempt the usual convention of society nor do she simply stand with the smoulder cigarette in my hand and gaze at she she in her turn look silently at i and at her look remember how in these very page have try to define the expression of her eye whether they be furtive or fierce to day they be fierce coldly and inexorably so "well say she at last be you still of the same mind as when see you last?""i have always be of the same mind ""let we understand each other professor gilroy say she slowly be not very safe person to trifle with as you should realize by now it be you who ask i to enter into series of experiment with you it be you who win my affection it be you who profess your love for i it be you who bring i your own photograph with word of affection upon it and finally it be you who on the very same evening think fit to insult i most outrageously address i as no man have ever dare to speak to i yet tell i that those word come from you in moment of passion and be prepared to forget and to forgive they you do not mean what you say austin you do not really hate me?"i might have pity this deform woman such longing for love break suddenly through the menace of her eye but then think of what have go through and my heart set like flint "if ever you hear i speak of love say you know very well that it be your voice which speak and not mine the only word of truth which have ever be able to say to you be those which you hear when last we meet ""i know some one have set you against i it be he she tap with her crutch upon the floor well you know very well that could bring you this instant crouch like spaniel to my foot you will not find i again in my hour of weakness when you can insult i with impunity have care what you be do professor gilroy you stand in terrible position you have not yet realize the hold which have upon you "i shrug my shoulder and turn away "well say she after pause if you despise my love must see what can be do with fear you smile but the day will come when you will come scream to i for pardon yes you will grovel on the ground before i proud as you be and you will curse the day that ever you turn i from your good friend into your most bitter enemy have care professor gilroy see white hand shake in the air and face which be scarcely human so convulsed be it with passion an instant later she be go and hear the quick hobble and tap recede down the passage but she have leave weight upon my heart vague presentiment of come misfortune lie heavy upon i try in vain to persuade myself that these be only word of empty anger can remember those relentless eye too clearly to think so what shall do ah what shall do be no long master of my own soul at any moment this loathsome parasite may creep into i and then must tell some one my hideous secret must tell it or
