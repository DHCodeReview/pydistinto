ingenious in her torment she know how fond be of my work and how highly my lecture be think of so it be from that point that she now attack i it will end can see in my lose my professorship but will fight to the finish she shall not drive i out of it without struggle be not conscious of any change during my lecture this morning save that for minute or two have dizziness and swimminess which rapidly pass away on the contrary congratulate myself upon having make my subject the function of the red corpuscle both interesting and clear be surprised therefore when student come into my laboratory immediately after the lecture and complain of be puzzle by the discrepancy between my statement and those in the text book he show i his note book in which be report as have in one portion of the lecture champion the most outrageous and unscientific heresy of course deny it and declare that he have misunderstood i but on compare his note with those of his companion it become clear that he be right and that really have make some most preposterous statement of course shall explain it away as be the result of moment of aberration but feel only too sure that it will be the first of series it be but month now to the end of the session and pray that may be able to hold out until then april 26 ten day have elapse since have have the heart to make any entry in my journal why should

authority have take my lectureship from i it have be do in the most delicate way purport to be temporary measure to relieve i from the effect of overwork and to give i the opportunity of recover my health none the less it have be do and be no long professor gilroy the laboratory be still in my charge but have little doubt that that also will soon go the fact be that my lecture have become the laugh stock of the university my class be crowd with student who come to see and hear what the eccentric professor would do or say next can not go into the detail of my humiliation oh that devilish woman there be no depth of buffoonery and imbecility to which she have not force i would begin my lecture clearly and well but always with the sense of come eclipse then as feel the influence would struggle against it strive with clenched hand and bead of sweat upon my brow to get the well of it while the student hear my incoherent word and watch my contortion would roar with laughter at the antic of their professor and then when she have once fairly master i out would come the most outrageous thing silly joke sentiment as though be propose toast snatch of ballad personal abuse even against some member of my class and then in moment my brain would clear again and my lecture would proceed decorously to the end no wonder that my conduct have be the talk of the college no wonder that the university senate have be compel to take official notice of such scandal oh that devilish woman!and the most dreadful part of it all be my own loneliness here sit in commonplace english bow window look out upon commonplace english street with its garish bus and its lounging policeman and behind i there hang shadow which be out of all keep with the age and place in the home of knowledge be weigh down and torture by power of which science know nothing no magistrate would listen to i no paper would discuss my case no doctor would believe my symptom my own most intimate friend would only look upon it as sign of brain derangement be out of all touch with my kind oh that devilish woman let she have care she may push i too far when the law can not help man he may make law for himself she meet i in the high street yesterday evening and speak to i it be as well for she perhaps that it be not between the hedge of lonely country road she ask i with her cold smile whether have
