company and very especially to hear his view upon bimetallism subject upon which he be by way of be an authority for an hour or more that evening listen to his monotonous chirrup about bad money drive out good the token value of silver the depreciation of the rupee and the true standard of exchange "suppose he cry with feeble violence that all the debt in the world be call up simultaneously and immediate payment insist upon what under our present condition would happen then?"i give the self evident answer that should be ruin man upon which he jump from his chair reprove i for my habitual levity which make it impossible for he to discuss any reasonable subject in my presence and bounce off out of the room to dress for masonic meeting at last be alone with gladys and the moment of fate have come all that evening have feel like the soldier who await the signal which will send he on forlorn hope hope of victory and fear of repulse alternate in his mind she sit with that proud delicate profile of hers outline against the red curtain how beautiful she be and yet how aloof we have be friend quite good friend but never could get beyond the same comradeship which might have establish with one of my fellow reporter upon the gazette perfectly frank perfectly kindly and perfectly unsexual my instinct be all against woman be too frank and at her ease with i it be no compliment to man where the real sex feeling begin timidity and distrust be its companion heritage from old wicked day when love and violence go often hand in hand the bent head the avert eye the falter voice the wincing figure these and not the unshrinking gaze and frank reply be the true signal of passion even in my short life have learn as much as that or have inherit it in that race memory which we call instinct gladys be full of every womanly quality some judge she to be cold and hard but such thought be treason that delicately bronzed skin almost oriental in its coloring that raven hair the large liquid eye the full but exquisite lip all the stigmata of passion be there but be sadly conscious that up to now have never find the secret of draw it forth however come what might should have do with suspense and bring matter to head to night she could but refuse i and well be repulse lover than an accepted brother so far my thought have carry i and be about to break the long and uneasy silence when two critical dark eye look round at i and the proud head be shake in smile reproof have presentiment that you be go to propose ned do wish you would n't for thing be so much nice as they be "i draw my chair little nearer now how do you know that be go to propose ask in genuine wonder "don't woman always know do you suppose any woman in the world be ever take unawares but oh ned our friendship have be so good and so pleasant what pity to spoil it do n't you feel how splendid it be that young man and young woman should be able to talk face to face as we have talked?""i do n't know gladys you see can talk face to face with with the station master ca n't imagine how that official come into the matter but in he trot and set we both laugh that do not satisfy i in the least want my arm round you and your head on my breast and oh gladys want she have spring from her chair as she see sign that propose to demonstrate some of my want you 've spoil everything ned she say it be all so beautiful and natural until this kind of thing come in it be such pity why ca n't you control yourself?""i do n't invent it plead it be nature it be love ""well perhaps if both love it may be different have never feel it ""but you must you with your beauty with your soul oh gladys you be make for love you must love!""one must wait till it come ""but why ca n't you love i gladys be it my appearance or what?"she do unbend little she put forward hand such gracious stoop attitude it be and she press back my head then she look into my upturned face with very wistful smile "no it be n't that she say at last you be not conceited boy by nature and so can safely tell you it be not that it be deep ""my character?"she nod severely "what can do to mend it do sit down and talk it over no really wo n't if you 'll only sit down!"she look at i with wonder distrust which be much more to my mind than her whole hearted confidence how primitive and bestial it look when you put it down in black and white and perhaps after all it be only feeling peculiar to myself anyhow she sit down "now tell i what be amiss with me?""i'm in love with somebody else say she it be my turn to jump out of my chair "it 's nobody in particular she explain laugh at the expression of my face only an ideal 've never meet the kind of man mean ""tell i about he what do he look like?""oh he might look very much like you ""how dear of you to say that well what be it that he do that do n't do just say the word teetotal vegetarian aeronaut theosophist superman 'll have try at it gladys if you will only give i an idea what would please you "she laugh at the elasticity of my character well in the first place do n't think my ideal would speak like that say she he would be hard sterner man not so ready to adapt himself to silly girl 's whim but above all he must be man who could do who could act who could look death in the face and have no fear of he man of great deed and strange experience it be never man that should love but always the glory he have win for they would be reflect upon i think of richard burton when read his wife 's life of he could so understand her love and lady stanley do you ever read the wonderful last chapter of that book about her husband these be the sort of man that woman could worship with all her soul and yet be the great not the less on account of her love honor by all the world as the inspirer of noble deed "she look so beautiful in her enthusiasm that nearly bring down the whole level of the interview grip myself hard and go on with the argument "we ca n't all be stanleys and burton say besides we do n't get the chance at least never have the chance if do should try to take it ""but chance be all around you it be the mark of the kind of man mean that he make his own chance you ca n't hold he back 've never meet he and yet seem to know he so well there be heroism all round we wait to be do it be for man to do they and for woman to reserve their love as reward for such man look at that young frenchman who go up last week in balloon it be blow gale of wind but because he be announce to go he insist on start the wind blow he fifteen hundred mile in twenty four hour and he fall in the middle of russia that be the kind of man mean think of the woman he love and how other woman must have envy she that be what should like to be envy for my man ""i'd have do it to please you ""but you should n't do it merely to please i you should do it because you ca n't help yourself because it be natural to you because the man in you be cry out for heroic expression now when you describe the wigan coal explosion last month could you not have go down and help those people in spite of the choke damp?""i do ""you never say so ""there be nothing worth buck about ""i do n't know she look at i with rather more interest that be brave of you ""i have to if you want to write good copy you must be where the thing be ""what prosaic motive it seem to take all the romance out of it but still whatever your motive be glad that you go down that mine she give i her hand but with such sweetness and dignity that could only stoop and kiss it dare say be merely foolish woman with young girl 's fancy and yet it be so real with i so entirely part of my very self that can not help act upon it if marry do want to marry famous man!""why should you not cry it be woman like you who brace man up give i chance and see if will take it besides as you say man ought to make their own chance and not wait until they be give look at clive just clerk and he conquer india by george 'll do something in the world yet!"she laugh at my sudden irish effervescence why not she say you have everything man could have youth health strength education energy be sorry you speak and now be glad so glad if it waken these thought in you!""and if do her dear hand rest like warm velvet upon my lip not another word sir you should have be at the office for evening duty half an hour ago only have n't the heart to remind you some day perhaps when you have win your place in the world we shall talk it over again "and so it be that find myself that foggy november evening pursue the camberwell tram with my heart glow within i and with the eager determination that not another day should elapse before should find some deed which be worthy of my lady but who who in all this wide world could ever have imagine the incredible shape which that deed be to take or the strange step by which be lead to the doing of it?and after all this opening chapter will seem to the reader to have nothing to do with my narrative and yet there would have be no narrative without it for it be only when man go out into the world with the thought that there be heroism all round he and with the desire all alive in his heart to follow any which may come within sight of he that he break away as do from the life he know and venture forth into the wonderful mystic twilight land where lie the great adventure and the great reward behold i then at the office of the daily gazette on the staff of which be most insignificant unit with the settle determination that very night if possible to find the quest which should be worthy of my gladys be it hardness be it selfishness that she should ask i to risk my life for her own glorification such thought may come to middle age but never to ardent three and twenty in the fever of his first love always like mcardle the crab old round back red head news editor and rather hope that he like i of course beaumont be the real boss but he live in the rarefied atmosphere of some olympian height from which he could distinguish nothing small than an international crisis or split in the cabinet sometimes we see he pass in lonely majesty to his inner sanctum with his eye stare vaguely and his mind hover over the balkans or the persian gulf he be above and beyond we but mcardle be his first lieutenant and it be he that we know the old man nod as enter the room and he push his spectacle far up on his bald forehead "well mr. malone from all hear you seem to be do very well say he in his kindly scotch accent thank he "the colliery explosion be excellent so be the southwark fire you have the true descreeptive touch what do you want to see i about?""to ask favor "he look alarmed and his eye shun mine tut tut what be it?""do you think sir that you could possibly send i on some mission for the paper would do my good to put it through and get you some good copy ""what sort of meesion have you in your mind mr. malone?""well sir anything that have adventure and danger in it really would do my very good the more difficult it be the well it would suit i ""you seem very anxious to lose your life ""to justify my life sir ""dear i mr. malone this be very very exalted be afraid the day for this sort of thing be rather past the expense of the special meesion business hardly justify the result and of course in any case it would only be an experienced man with name that would command public confidence who would get such an order the big blank space in the map be all be fill in and there be no room for romance anywhere wait bit though he add with sudden smile upon his face talk of the blank space of the map give i an idea what about expose fraud modern munchausen and make he rideeculous you could show he up as the liar that he be eh man it would be fine how do it appeal to you?""anything anywhere care nothing "mcardle be plunge in thought for some minute "i wonder whether you could get on friendly or at least on talk term with the fellow he say at last you seem to have sort of genius for establish relation with people seempathy suppose or animal magnetism or youthful vitality or something be conscious of it myself ""you be very good sir ""so why should you not try your luck with professor challenger of enmore park?"i dare say look little startled "challenger cry professor challenger the famous zoologist be n't he the man who break the skull of blundell of the telegraph?"the news editor smile grimly "do you mind do n't you say it be adventure you be after?""it be all in the way of business sir answer "exactly do n't suppose he can always be so violent as that be think that blundell get he at the wrong moment maybe or in the wrong fashion you may have well luck or more tact in handle he there be something in your line there be sure and the gazette should work it ""i really know nothing about he say i. only remember his name in connection with the police court proceeding for strike blundell

more into pink oval fringe with gingery fluff the interview be at an end walk across to the savage club but instead of turn into it lean upon the railing of adelphi terrace and gaze thoughtfully for long time at the brown oily river can always think most sanely and clearly in the open air take out the list of professor challenger 's exploit and read it over under the electric lamp then have what can only regard as an inspiration as pressman feel sure from what have be tell that could never hope to get into touch with this cantankerous professor but these recrimination twice mention in his
