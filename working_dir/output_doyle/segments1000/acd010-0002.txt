my work accomplish when have occasion to spend night at small indian village at point where certain tributary the name and position of which withhold open into the main river the native be cucama indians an amiable but degraded race with mental power hardly superior to the average londoner have effect some cure among they upon my way up the river and have impress they considerably with my personality so that be not surprised to find myself eagerly await upon my return gather from their sign that someone have urgent need of my medical service and follow the chief to one of his hut when enter find that the sufferer to whose aid have be summon have that instant expire he be to my surprise no indian but white man indeed may say very white man for he be flaxen haired and have some characteristic of an albino he be clothe in rag be very emaciate and bear every trace of prolong hardship so far as could understand the account of the native he be complete stranger to they and have come upon their village through the wood alone and in the last stage of exhaustion "the man 's knapsack lie beside the couch and examine the content his name be write upon tab within it maple white lake avenue detroit michigan it be name to which be prepared always to lift my hat it be not too much to say that it will rank level with my own when the final credit of this business come to be apportion "from the content of the knapsack it be evident that this man have be an artist and poet in search of effect there be scrap of verse do not profess to be judge of such thing but they appear to i to be singularly want in merit there be also some rather commonplace picture of river scenery paint box box of colored chalk some brush that curved bone which lie upon my inkstand volume of baxter 's moth and butterfly cheap revolver and few cartridge of personal equipment he either have none or he have lose it in his journey such be the total effect of this strange american bohemian "i be turn away from he when observe that something project from the front of his ragged jacket it be this sketch book which be as dilapidate then as you see it now indeed can assure you that first folio of shakespeare could not be treat with great reverence than this relic have be since it come into my possession hand it to you now and ask you to take it page by page and to examine the content "he help himself to cigar and lean back with fiercely critical pair of eye take note of the effect which this document would produce have open the volume with some expectation of revelation though of what nature could not imagine the first page be disappointing however as it contain nothing but the picture of very fat man in pea jacket with the legend jimmy colver on the mail boat write beneath it there follow several page which be fill with small sketch of indians and their way then come picture of cheerful and corpulent ecclesiastic in shovel hat sit opposite very thin european and the inscription lunch with fra cristofero at rosario study of woman and baby account for several more page and then there be an unbroken series of animal drawing with such explanation as manatee upon sandbank turtles and their egg black ajouti under miriti palm the matter disclose some sort of pig like animal and finally come double page of study of long snouted and very unpleasant saurian could make nothing of it and say so to the professor "surely these be only crocodiles?""alligator alligator there be hardly such thing as true crocodile in south america the distinction between they mean that could see nothing unusual nothing to justify what you have say "he smile serenely "try the next page say he be still unable to sympathize it be full page sketch of landscape roughly tint in color the kind of painting which an open air artist take as guide to future more elaborate effort there be pale green foreground of feathery vegetation which slope upwards and end in line of cliff dark red in color and curiously rib like some basaltic formation which have see they extend in an unbroken wall right across the background at one point be an isolated pyramidal rock crown by great tree which appear to be separate by cleft from the main crag behind it all blue tropical sky thin green line of vegetation fringe the summit of the ruddy cliff "well he ask "it be no doubt curious formation say but be not geologist enough to say that it be wonderful ""wonderful he repeat it be unique it be incredible no one on earth have ever dream of such possibility now the next "i turn it over and give an exclamation of surprise there be full page picture of the most extraordinary creature that have ever see it be the wild dream of an opium smoker vision of delirium the head be like that of fowl the body that of bloated lizard the trail tail be furnish with upward turn spike and the curved back be edge with high serrate fringe which look like dozen cock wattle place behind each other in front of this creature be an absurd mannikin or dwarf in human form who stand stare at it "well what do you think of that cry the professor rub his hand with an air of triumph "it be monstrous grotesque ""but what make he draw such an animal?""trade gin should think ""oh that be the good explanation you can give be it?""well sir what be yours?""the obvious one that the creature exist that be actually sketch from the life "i should have laugh only that have vision of our do another catharine wheel down the passage "no doubt say no doubt as one humor an imbecile confess however add that this tiny human figure puzzle i if it be an indian we could set it down as evidence of some pigmy race in america but it appear to be european in sun hat "the professor snort like an angry buffalo you really touch the limit say he you enlarge my view of the possible cerebral paresis mental inertia wonderful!"he be too absurd to make i angry indeed it be waste of energy for if you be go to be angry with this man you would be angry all the time content myself with smile wearily it strike i that the man be small say i."look here he cry lean forward and dab great hairy sausage of finger on to the picture you see that plant behind the animal suppose you think it be dandelion or brussels sprout what well it be vegetable ivory palm and they run to about fifty or sixty foot do n't you see that the man be put in for purpose he could n't really have stand in front of that brute and live to draw it he sketch himself in to give scale of height he be we will say over five foot high the tree be ten time big which be what one would expect ""good heaven cry then you think the beast be why charing cross station would hardly make kennel for such brute!""apart from exaggeration he be certainly well grow speciman say the professor complacently "but cry surely the whole experience of the human race be not to be set aside on account of single sketch have turn over the leave and ascertain that there be nothing more in the book single sketch by wander american artist who may have do it under hashish or in the delirium of fever or simply in order to gratify freakish imagination you ca n't as man of science defend such position as that "for answer the professor take book down from shelf "this be an excellent monograph by my gifted friend ray lankester say he there be an illustration here which would interest you ah yes here it be the inscription beneath it run probable appearance in life of the jurassic dinosaur stegosaurus the hind leg alone be twice as tall as full grown man well what do you make of that?"he hand i the open book start as look at the picture in this reconstructed animal of dead world there be certainly very great resemblance to the sketch of the unknown artist "that be certainly remarkable say i."but you wo n't admit that it be final?""surely it might be coincidence or this american may have see picture of the kind and carry it in his memory it would be likely to recur to man in delirium ""very good say the professor indulgently we leave it at that will now ask you to look at this bone he hand over the one which he have already describe as part of the dead man 's possession it be about six inch long and thick than my thumb with some indication of dry cartilage at one end of it "to what known creature do that bone belong ask the professor examine it with care and try to recall some half forget knowledge "it might be very thick human collar bone say my companion wave his hand in contemptuous deprecation "the human collar bone be curve this be straight there be groove upon its surface show that great tendon play across it which could not be the case with clavicle ""then must confess that do n't know what it be ""you need not be ashamed to expose your ignorance for do n't suppose the whole south kensington staff could give name to it he take little bone the size of bean out of pill box so far as be judge this human bone be the analogue of the one which you hold in your hand that will give you some idea of the size of the creature you will observe from the cartilage that this be no fossil speciman but recent what do you say to that?""surely in an elephant he wince as if in pain "don't do n't talk of elephant in south america even in these day of board school well interrupt any large south american animal tapir for example ""you may take it young man that be verse in the element of my business this be not conceivable bone either of tapir or of any other creature know to zoology it belong to very large very strong and by all analogy very fierce animal which exist upon the face of the earth but have not yet come under the notice of science you be still unconvinced?""i be at least deeply interested ""then your case be not hopeless feel that there be reason lurk in you somewhere so we will patiently grope round for it we will now leave the dead american and proceed with my narrative you can imagine that could hardly come away from the amazon without probe deeply into the matter there be indication as to the direction from which the dead traveler have come indian legend would alone have be my guide for find that rumor of strange land be common among all the riverine tribe you have hear no doubt of curupuri?""never ""curupuri be the spirit of the wood something terrible something malevolent something to be avoid none can describe its shape or nature but it be word of terror along the amazon now all tribe agree as to the direction in which curupuri live it be the same direction from which the american have come something terrible lie that way it be my business to find out what it be ""what do you do my flippancy be all go this massive man compel one 's attention and respect "i overcome the extreme reluctance of the native reluctance which extend even to talk upon the subject and by judicious persuasion and gift aid will admit by some threat of coercion get two of they to act as guide after many adventure which need not describe and after travel distance which will not mention in direction which withhold we come at last to tract of country which have never be describe nor indeed visit save by my unfortunate predecessor would you kindly look at this?"he hand i photograph half plate size "the unsatisfactory appearance of it be due to the fact say he that on descend the river the boat be upset and the case which contain the undeveloped film be break with disastrous result nearly all of they be totally ruin an irreparable loss this be one of the few which partially escape this explanation of deficiency or abnormality you will kindly accept there be talk of faking be not in mood to argue such point "the photograph be certainly very off colored an unkind critic might easily have misinterpret that dim surface it be dull gray landscape and as gradually decipher the detail of it realize that it represent long and enormously high line of cliff exactly like an immense cataract see in the distance with sloping tree clothe plain in the foreground "i believe it be the same place as the paint picture say i."it be the same place the professor answer find trace of the fellow 's camp now look at this "it be nearer view of the same scene though the photograph be extremely defective could distinctly see the isolated tree crown pinnacle of rock which be detach from the crag "i have no doubt of it at all say i."well that be something gain say he we progress do we not now will you please look at the top of that rocky pinnacle do you observe something there?""an enormous tree ""but on the tree?""a large bird say i. he hand i lens "yes say peer through it large bird stand on the tree it appear to have considerable beak should say it be pelican ""i can not congratulate you upon your eyesight say the professor it be not pelican nor indeed be it bird it may interest you to know that succeed in shoot that particular speciman it be the only absolute proof of my experience which be able to bring away with i ""you have it then here at last be tangible corroboration "i have it it be unfortunately lose with so much else in the same boat accident which ruin my photograph clutch at it as it disappear in the swirl of the rapid and part of its wing be leave in my hand be insensible when wash ashore but the miserable remnant of my superb speciman be still intact now lay it before you "from drawer he produce what seem to i to be the upper portion of the wing of large bat it be at least two foot in length curved bone with membranous veil beneath it "a monstrous bat suggest "nothing of the sort say the professor severely live as do in an educate and scientific atmosphere could not have conceive that the first principle of zoology be so little known be it possible that you do not know the elementary fact in comparative anatomy that the wing of bird be really the forearm while the wing of bat consist of three elongate finger with membrane between now in this case the bone be certainly not the forearm and you can see for yourself that this be single membrane hang upon single bone and therefore that it can not belong to bat but if it be neither bird nor bat what be it?"my small stock of knowledge be exhaust "i really do not know say i. he open the standard work to which he have already refer i "here say he point to the picture of an extraordinary flying monster be an excellent reproduction of the dimorphodon or pterodactyl fly reptile of the jurassic period on the next page be diagram of the mechanism of its wing kindly compare it with the speciman in your hand "a wave of amazement pass over i as look be convince there could be no get away from it the cumulative proof be overwhelming the sketch the photograph the narrative and now the actual speciman the evidence be complete say so say so warmly for feel that the professor be an ill use man he lean back in his chair with droop eyelid and tolerant smile bask in this sudden gleam of sunshine "it be just the very big thing that ever hear of say though it be my journalistic rather than my scientific enthusiasm that be rouse it be colossal you be columbus of science who have discover lost world be awfully sorry if seem to doubt you it be all so unthinkable but understand evidence when see it and this should be good enough for anyone "the professor purr with satisfaction "and then sir what do you do next?""it be the wet season mr. malone and my store be exhaust explore some portion of this huge cliff but be unable to find any way to scale it the pyramidal rock upon which see and shoot the pterodactyl be more accessible be something of cragsman do manage to get half way to the top of that from that height have well idea of the plateau upon the top of the crag it appear to be very large neither to east nor to west could see any end to the vista of green cap cliff below it be swampy jungly region full of snake insect and fever it be natural protection to this singular country ""did you see any other trace of life?""no sir do not but during the week that we lie encamp at the base of the cliff we hear some very strange noise from above ""but the creature that the american draw how do you account for that?""we can only suppose that he must have make his way to the summit and see it there we know therefore that there be way up we know equally that it must be very difficult one otherwise the creature would have come down and overrun the surround country surely that be clear?""but how do they come to be there?""i do not think that the problem be very obscure one say the professor there can only be one explanation south america be as you may have hear granite continent at this single point in the interior there have be in some far distant age great sudden volcanic upheaval these cliff may remark be basaltic and therefore plutonic an area as large perhaps as sussex have be lift up en bloc with all its living content and cut off by perpendicular precipice of hardness which defy erosion from all the rest of the continent what be the result why the ordinary law of nature be suspend the various check which influence the struggle for existence in the world at large be all neutralize or alter creature survive which would otherwise disappear you will observe that both the pterodactyl and the stegosaurus be jurassic and therefore of great age in the order of life they have be artificially conserve by those strange accidental condition ""but surely your evidence be conclusive you have only to lay it before the proper authority ""so in my simplicity have imagine say the professor bitterly can only tell you that it be not so that be meet at every turn by incredulity bear partly of stupidity and partly of jealousy it be not my nature sir to cringe to any man or to seek to prove fact if my word have be doubted after the first have not condescend to show such corroborative proof as possess the subject become hateful to i would not speak of it when man like yourself who represent the foolish curiosity of the public come to disturb my privacy be unable to meet they with dignified reserve by nature be admit somewhat fiery and under provocation be inclined to be violent fear you may have remark it "i nurse my eye and be silent "my wife have frequently remonstrate with i upon the subject and yet fancy that any man of honor would feel the same to night however propose to give an extreme example of the control of the will over the emotion invite you to be present at the exhibition he hand i card from his desk you will perceive that mr. percival waldron naturalist of some popular repute be announce to lecture at eight thirty at the zoological institute 's hall upon the record of the ages have be specially invite to be present upon the platform and to move vote of thank to the lecturer while do so shall make it my business with infinite tact and delicacy to throw out few remark which may arouse the interest of the audience and cause some of they to desire to go more deeply into the matter nothing contentious you understand but only an indication that there be great deep beyond shall hold myself strongly in leash and see whether by this self restraint attain more favorable result ""and may come ask eagerly "why surely he answer cordially he have an enormously massive genial manner which be almost as overpower as his violence his smile of benevolence be wonderful thing when his cheek would suddenly bunch into two red apple between his half closed eye and his great black beard by all mean come it will be comfort to i to know that have one ally in the hall however inefficient and ignorant of the subject he may be fancy there will be large audience for waldron though an absolute charlatan have considerable popular following now mr. malone have give you rather more of my time than have intend the individual must not monopolize what be mean for the world shall be pleased to see you at the lecture to night in the meantime you will understand that no public use be to be make of any of the material that have give you ""but mr. mcardle my news editor you know will want to know what have do ""tell he what you like you can say among other thing that if he send anyone else to intrude upon i shall call upon he with ride whip but leave it to you that nothing of all this appear in print very good then the zoological institute 's hall at eight thirty to night have last impression of red cheek blue ripple beard and intolerant eye as he wave i out of the room what with the physical shock incidental to my first interview with professor challenger and the mental one which accompany the second be somewhat demoralize journalist by the time find myself in enmore park once more in my aching head the one thought be throbbing that there really be truth in this man 's story that it be of tremendous consequence and that it would work up into inconceivable copy for the gazette when could obtain permission to use it taxicab be wait at the end of the road so spring into it and drive down to the office mcardle be at his post as usual "well he cry expectantly what may it run to be think young man you have be in the war do n't tell i that he assault you ""we have little difference at first ""what man it be what do you do?""well he become more reasonable and we have chat but get nothing out of he nothing for publication ""i'm not so sure about that you get black eye out of he and that be for publication we ca n't have this reign of
