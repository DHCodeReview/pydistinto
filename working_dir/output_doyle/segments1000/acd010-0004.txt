trick of speech and of thought it be only the need of get in the account of my meeting which draw i at last from his company leave he seat amid his pink radiance oil the lock of his favorite rifle while he still chuckle to himself at the thought of the adventure which await we it be very clear to i that if danger lay before we could not in all england have find cool head or braver spirit with which to share they that night weary as be after the wonderful happening of the day sit late with mcardle the news editor explain to he the whole situation which he think important enough to bring next morning before the notice of sir george beaumont the chief it be agree that should write home full account of my adventure in the shape of successive letter to mcardle and that these should either be edit for the gazette as they arrive or hold back to be publish later accord to the wish of professor challenger since we could not yet know what condition he might attach to those direction which should guide we to the unknown land in response to telephone inquiry we receive nothing more definite than fulmination against the press end up with the remark that if we would notify our boat he would hand we any direction which he might think it proper to give we at the moment of start second question from we fail to elicit any answer at all save plaintive bleat from his wife to the effect that her husband be in very violent temper already and that she hope we would do nothing to make it bad third attempt later in the day provoke terrific crash and subsequent message from the central exchange that professor challenger 's receiver have be shatter after that we abandon all attempt at communication and now my patient reader can address you directly no long from now onwards if indeed any continuation of this narrative should ever reach you it can only be through the paper which represent in the hand of the editor leave this account of the event which have lead up to one of the most remarkable expedition of all time so that if never return to england there shall be some record as to how the affair come about be write these last line in the saloon of the booth liner francisca and they will go back by the pilot to the keeping of mr. mcardle let i draw one last picture before close the notebook picture which be the last memory of the old country which bear away with i it be wet foggy morning in the late spring thin cold rain be fall three shine mackintoshed figure be walk down the quay make for the gang plank of the great liner from which the blue peter be fly in front of they porter push trolley pile high with trunk wrap and gun case professor summerlee long melancholy figure walk with drag step and droop head as one who be already profoundly sorry for himself lord john roxton step briskly and his thin eager face beam forth between his hunting cap and his muffler as for myself be glad to have get the bustling day of preparation and the pang of leave taking behind i and have no doubt that show it in my bearing suddenly just as we reach the vessel there be shout behind we it be professor challenger who have promise to see we off he run after we puffing red faced irascible figure "no thank you say he should much prefer not to go aboard have only few word to say to you and they can very well be say where we be beg you not to imagine that be in any way indebted to you for make this journey would have you to understand that it be matter of perfect indifference to i and refuse to entertain the most remote sense of personal obligation truth be truth and nothing which you can report can affect it in any way though it may excite the emotion and allay the curiosity of number of very ineffectual people my direction for your instruction and guidance be in this seal envelope you will open it when you reach town upon the amazon which be call manaos but not until the date and hour which be mark upon the outside have make myself clear leave the strict observance of my condition entirely to your honor no mr. malone will place no restriction upon your correspondence since the ventilation of the fact be the object of your journey but demand that you shall give no particular as to your exact destination and that nothing be actually publish until your return good bye sir you have do something to mitigate my feeling for the loathsome profession to which you unhappily belong good bye lord john science be as understand seal book to you but you may congratulate yourself upon the hunting field which await you you will no doubt have the opportunity of describe in the field how you bring down the rocketing dimorphodon and good bye to you also professor summerlee if you be still capable of self improvement of which be frankly unconvinced you will surely return to london wise man "so he turn upon his heel and minute later from the deck could see his short squat figure bob about in the distance as he make his way back to his train well we be well down channel now there be the last bell for letter and it be good bye to the pilot we 'll be down hull down on the old trail from now on god bless all we leave behind we and send we safely back will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our luxurious voyage upon the booth liner nor will tell of our week 's stay at para save that should wish to acknowledge the great kindness of the pereira da pinta company in help we to get together our equipment will also allude very briefly to our river journey up wide slow move clay tint stream in steamer which be little small than that which have carry we across the atlantic eventually we find ourselves through the narrow of obidos and reach the town of manaos here we be rescue from the limited attraction of the local inn by mr. shortman the representative of the british and brazilian trading company in his hospital fazenda we spend our time until the day when we be empower to open the letter of instruction give to we by professor challenger before reach the surprising event of that date would desire to give clear sketch of my comrade in this enterprise and of the associate whom we have already gather together in south america speak freely and leave the use of my material to your own discretion mr. mcardle since it be through your hand that this report must pass before it reach the world the scientific attainment of professor summerlee be too well known for i to trouble to recapitulate they he be well equip for rough expedition of this sort than one would imagine at first sight his tall gaunt stringy figure be insensible to fatigue and his dry half sarcastic and often wholly unsympathetic manner be uninfluence by any change in his surrounding though in his sixty sixth year have never hear he express any dissatisfaction at the occasional hardship which we have have to encounter have regard his presence as an encumbrance to the expedition but as matter of fact be now well convinced that his power of endurance be as great as my own in temper he be naturally acid and sceptical from the beginning he have never conceal his belief that professor challenger be an

view which with much passionate distortion of his thin feature and wagging of his thin goat like beard he pour into our ear all the way from southampton to manaos since land from the boat he have obtain some consolation from the beauty and variety of the insect and bird life around he for he be absolutely whole hearted in his devotion to science he spend his day flit through the wood with his shot gun and his butterfly net and his evening in mount the many specimen he have acquire among his minor peculiarity be that he be careless as to his attire unclean in his person exceedingly absent minded in his habit and addict to smoke short briar pipe which be seldom out of his mouth he have be upon several scientific expedition in his youth he be with robertson in papua and the life of the camp and the canoe be nothing fresh to he lord john roxton have some point in common with professor summerlee and other in which they be the very antithesis to each other he be twenty year young but have something of the same spare scraggy physique as to his appearance have as recollect describe it in that portion of my narrative which have leave behind i in london he be exceedingly neat and prim in his way dress always with great care in white drill suit and high brown mosquito boot and shave at least once day like most man of action he be laconic in speech and sink readily into his own thought but he be always quick to answer question or join in conversation talk in queer jerky half humorous fashion his knowledge of the world and very especially
