of south america be surprising and he have whole hearted belief in the possibility of our journey which be not to be dash by the sneer of professor summerlee he have gentle voice and quiet manner but behind his twinkle blue eye there lurk capacity for furious wrath and implacable resolution the more dangerous because they be hold in leash he speak little of his own exploit in brazil and peru but it be revelation to i to find the excitement which be cause by his presence among the riverine native who look upon he as their champion and protector the exploit of the red chief as they call he have become legend among they but the real fact as far as could learn they be amazing enough these be that lord john have find himself some year before in that no man's land which be form by the half define frontier between peru brazil and columbia in this great district the wild rubber tree flourish and have become as in the congo curse to the native which can only be compare to their force labor under the spaniards upon the old silver mine of darien handful of villainous half breed dominate the country arm such indians as would support they and turn the rest into slave terrorize they with the most inhuman torture in order to force they to gather the india rubber which be then float down the river to para lord john roxton expostulate on behalf of the wretched victim and receive nothing but threat and insult for his pain he then formally declare war against pedro lopez the leader of the slave driver enrol band of runaway slave in his service arm they and conduct campaign which end by his killing with his own hand the notorious half breed and break down the system which he represent no wonder that the ginger head man with the silky voice and the free and easy manner be now look upon with deep interest upon the bank of the great south american river though the feeling he inspire be naturally mixed since the gratitude of the native be equal by the resentment of those who desire to exploit they one useful result of his former experience be that he could talk fluently in the lingoa geral which be the peculiar talk one third portuguese and two third indian which be current all over brazil have say before that lord john roxton be south americomaniac he could not speak of that great country without ardor and this ardor be infectious for ignorant as be he fix my attention and stimulate my curiosity how wish could reproduce the glamour of his discourse the peculiar mixture of accurate knowledge and of racy imagination which give they their fascination until even the professor 's cynical and sceptical smile would gradually vanish from his thin face as he listen he would tell the history of the mighty river so rapidly explore for some of the first conqueror of peru actually cross the entire continent upon its water and yet so unknown in regard to all that lie behind its ever change bank "what be there he would cry point to the north wood and marsh and unpenetrated jungle who know what it may shelter and there to the south wilderness of swampy forest where no white man have ever be the unknown be up against we on every side outside the narrow line of the river what do anyone know who will say what be possible in such country why should old man challenger not be right at which direct defiance the stubborn sneer would reappear upon professor summerlee 's face and he would sit shake his sardonic head in unsympathetic silence behind the cloud of his briar root pipe so much for the moment for my two white companion whose character and limitation will be far expose as surely as my own as this narrative proceed but already we have enrol certain retainer who may play no small part in what be to come the first be gigantic negro name zambo who be black hercules as willing as any horse and about as intelligent he we enlist at para on the recommendation of the steamship company on whose vessel he have learn to speak halting english it be at para also that we engage gomez and manuel two half breed from up the river just come down with cargo of redwood they be swarthy fellow bearded and fierce as active and wiry as panther both of they have spend their life in those upper water of the amazon which we be about to explore and it be this recommendation which have cause lord john to engage they one of they gomez have the further advantage that he could speak excellent english these man be willing to act as our personal servant to cook to row or to make themselves useful in any way at payment of fifteen dollar month besides these we have engage three mojo indians from bolivia who be the most skilful at fishing and boat work of all the river tribe the chief of these we call mojo after his tribe and the other be know as jose and fernando three white man then two half breed one negro and three indians make up the personnel of the little expedition which lie wait for its instruction at manaos before start upon its singular quest at last after weary week the day have come and the hour ask you to picture the shaded sitting room of the fazenda st. ignatio two mile inland from the town of manaos outside lie the yellow brassy glare of the sunshine with the shadow of the palm tree as black and definite as the tree themselves the air be calm full of the eternal hum of insect tropical chorus of many octave from the deep drone of the bee to the high keen pipe of the mosquito beyond the veranda be small clear garden bound with cactus hedge and adorn with clump of flowering shrub round which the great blue butterfly and the tiny humming bird flutter and dart in crescent of sparkle light within we be seat round the cane table on which lie seal envelope inscribe upon it in the jagged handwriting of professor challenger be the word instruction to lord john roxton and party to be open at manaos upon july 15th at 12 o'clock precisely "lord john have place his watch upon the table beside he "we have seven more minute say he the old dear be very precise "professor summerlee give an acid smile as he pick up the envelope in his gaunt hand "what can it possibly matter whether we open it now or in seven minute say he it be all part and parcel of the same system of quackery and nonsense for which regret to say that the writer be notorious ""oh come we must play the game accordin to rule say lord john it be old man challenger 's show and we be here by his good will so it would be rotten bad form if we do n't follow his instruction to the letter ""a pretty business it be cry the professor bitterly it strike i as preposterous in london but be bind to say that it seem even more so upon close acquaintance do n't know what be inside this envelope but unless it be something pretty definite shall be much tempt to take the next down river boat and catch the bolivia at para after all have some more responsible work in the world than to run about disprove the assertion of lunatic now roxton surely it be time ""time it be say lord john you can blow the whistle he take up the envelope and cut it with his penknife from it he draw folded sheet of paper this he carefully open out and flatten on the table it be blank sheet he turn it over again it be blank we look at each other in bewildered silence which be break by discordant burst of derisive laughter from professor summerlee "it be an open admission he cry what more do you want the fellow be self confess humbug we have only to return home and report he as the brazen imposter that he be ""invisible ink suggest "i do n't think say lord roxton hold the paper to the light no young fellah my lad there be no use deceive yourself 'll go bail for it that nothing have ever be write upon this paper ""may come in boom voice from the veranda the shadow of squat figure have steal across the patch of sunlight that voice that monstrous breadth of shoulder we spring to our foot with gasp of astonishment as challenger in round boyish straw hat with colored ribbon challenger with his hand in his jacket pocket and his canvas shoe daintily point as he walk appear in the open space before we he throw back his head and there he stand in the golden glow with all his old assyrian luxuriance of beard all his native insolence of droop eyelid and intolerant eye "i fear say he take out his watch that be few minute too late when give you this envelope must confess that have never intend that you should open it for it have be my fix intention to be with you before the hour the unfortunate delay can be apportion between blunder pilot and an intrusive sandbank fear that it have give my colleague professor summerlee occasion to blaspheme ""i be bind to say sir say lord john with some sternness of voice that your turn up be considerable relief to we for our mission seem to have come to premature end even now ca n't for the life of i understand why you should have work it in so extraordinary manner "instead of answering professor challenger enter shake hand with myself and lord john bow with ponderous insolence to professor summerlee and sink back into basket chair which creak and sway beneath his weight "is all ready for your journey he ask "we can start to morrow ""then so you shall you need no chart of direction now since you will have the inestimable advantage of my own guidance from the first have determine that would myself preside over your investigation the most elaborate chart would as you will readily admit be poor substitute for my own intelligence and advice as to the small ruse which play upon you in the matter of the envelope it be clear that have tell you all my intention should have be force to resist unwelcome pressure to travel out with you ""not from i sir exclaim professor summerlee heartily so long as there be another ship upon the atlantic "challenger wave he away with his great hairy hand "your common sense will be sure sustain my objection and realize that it be well that should direct my own movement and appear only at the exact moment when my presence be need that moment have now arrive you be in safe hand you will not now fail to reach your destination from henceforth take command of this expedition and must ask you to complete your preparation to night so that we may be able to make an early start in the morning my time be of value and the same thing may be say no doubt in less degree of your own propose therefore that we push on as rapidly as possible until have demonstrate what you have come to see "lord john roxton have charter large steam launch the esmeralda which be to carry we up the river so far as climate go it be immaterial what time we choose for our expedition as the temperature range from seventy five to ninety degree both summer and winter with no appreciable difference in heat in moisture however it be otherwise from december to may be the period of the rain and during this time the river slowly rise until it attain height of nearly forty foot above its low water mark it flood the bank extend in great lagoon over monstrous waste of country and form huge district call locally the gapo which be for the most part too marshy for foot travel and too shallow for boat about june the water begin to fall and be at their low at october or november thus our expedition be at the time of the dry season when the great river and its tributary be more or less in normal condition the current of the river be slight one the drop be not great than eight inch in mile no stream could be more convenient for navigation since the prevail wind be south east and sailing boat may make continuous progress to the peruvian frontier drop down again with the current in our own case the excellent engine of the esmeralda could disregard the sluggish flow of the stream and we make as rapid progress as if we be navigate stagnant lake for three day we steam north westward up stream which even here thousand mile from its mouth be still so enormous that from its center the two bank be mere shadow upon the distant skyline on the fourth day after leave manaos we turn into tributary which at its mouth be little small than the main stream it narrow rapidly however and after two more day steaming we reach an indian village where the professor insist that we should land and that the esmeralda should be send back to manaos we should soon come upon rapid he explain which would make its further use impossible he add privately that we be now approach the door of the unknown country and that the few whom we take into our confidence the well it would be to this end also he make each of we give our word of honor that we would publish or say nothing which would give any exact clue as to the whereabouts of our travel while the servant be all solemnly swear to the same effect it be for this reason that be compel to be vague in my narrative and would warn my reader that in any map or diagram which may give the relation of place to each other may be correct but the point of the compass be carefully confused so that in no way can it be take as an actual guide to the country professor challenger 's reason for secrecy may be valid or not but we have no choice but to adopt they for he be prepared to abandon the whole expedition rather than modify the condition upon which he would guide we it be august 2nd when we snap our last link with the outer world by bid farewell to the esmeralda since then four day have pass during which we have engage two large canoe from the indians make of so light material skin over bamboo framework that we should be able to carry they round any obstacle these we have load with all our effect and have engage two additional indians to help we in the navigation understand that they be the very two ataca and ipetu by name who accompany professor challenger upon his previous journey they appear to be terrify at the prospect of repeat it but the chief have patriarchal power in these country and if the bargain be good in his eye the clansman have little choice in the matter so to morrow we disappear into the unknown this account be transmit down the river by canoe and it may be our last word to those who be interested in our fate have accord to our arrangement address it to you my dear mr. mcardle and leave it to your discretion to delete alter or do what you like with it from the assurance of professor challenger 's manner and in spite of the continued scepticism of professor summerlee have no doubt that our leader will make good his statement and that we be really on the eve of some most remarkable experience our friend at home may well rejoice with we for we be at our goal and up to point at least we have show that the statement of professor challenger can be verify we have not it be true ascend the plateau but it lie before we and even professor summerlee be in more chastened mood not that he will for an instant admit that his rival could be right but he be less persistent in his incessant objection and have sink for the most part into an observant silence must hark back however and continue my narrative from where drop it we be send home one of our local indians who be injure and be commit this letter to his charge with considerable doubt in my mind as to whether it will ever come to hand when write last we be about to leave the indian village where we have be deposit by the esmeralda have to begin my report by bad news for the first serious personal trouble pass over the incessant bickering between the professors occur this evening and might have have tragic ending have speak of our english speak half breed gomez fine worker and willing fellow but afflict fancy with the vice of curiosity which be common enough among such man on the last evening he seem to have hide himself near the hut in which we be discuss our plan and be observe by our huge negro zambo who be as faithful as dog and have the hatred which all his race bear to the half breed he be drag out and carry into our presence gomez whip out his knife however and but for the huge strength of his captor which enable he to disarm he with one hand he would certainly have stab he the matter have end in reprimand the opponent have be compel to shake hand and there be every hope that all will be well as to the feud of the two learn man they be continuous and bitter it must be admit that challenger be provocative in the last degree but summerlee have an acid tongue which make matter bad last night challenger say that he never care to walk on the thames embankment and look up the river as it be always sad to see one 's own eventual goal he be convince of course that he be destine for westminster abbey summerlee rejoin however with sour smile by say that he understand that millbank prison have be pull down challenger 's conceit be too colossal to allow he to be really annoyed he only smile in his beard and repeat really really in the pitying tone one would use to child indeed they be child both the one wizene and cantankerous the other formidable and overbearing yet each with brain which have put he in the front rank of his scientific age brain character soul only as one see more of life do one understand how distinct be each the very next day we do actually make our start upon this remarkable expedition we find that all our possession fit very easily into the two canoe and we divide our personnel six in each take the obvious precaution in the interest of peace of put one professor into each canoe personally be with challenger who be in beatific humor move about as one in silent ecstasy and beam benevolence from every feature have have some experience of he in other mood however and shall be the less surprised when the thunderstorm suddenly come up amidst the sunshine if it be impossible to be at your ease it be equally impossible to be dull in his company for one be always in state of half tremulous doubt as to what sudden turn his formidable temper may take for two day we make our way up good sized river some hundred of yard broad and dark in color but transparent so that one could usually see the bottom the affluent of the amazon be half of they of this nature while the other half be whitish and opaque the difference depend upon the class of country through which they have flow the dark indicate vegetable decay while the other point to clayey soil twice we come across rapid and in each case make portage of half mile or so to avoid they the wood on either side be primeval which be more easily penetrate than wood of the second growth and we have no great difficulty in carry our canoe through they how shall ever forget the solemn mystery of it the height of the tree and the thickness of the bole exceed anything which in my town breed life could have imagine shoot upwards in magnificent column until at an enormous distance above our head we could dimly discern the spot where they throw out their side branch into gothic upward curve which coalesce to form one great matted roof of verdure through which only an occasional golden ray of sunshine shoot downward to trace thin dazzling line of light amidst the majestic obscurity as we walk noiselessly amid the thick soft carpet of decay vegetation the hush fall upon our soul which come upon we in the twilight of the abbey and even professor challenger 's full cheste note sink into whisper alone should have be ignorant of the name of these giant growth but our man of science point out the cedar the great silk cotton tree and the redwood tree with all that profusion of various plant which have make this continent the chief supplier to the human race of those gift of nature which depend upon the vegetable world while it be the most backward in those product which come from animal life vivid orchid and wonderful colored lichen smolder upon the swarthy tree trunk and where wander shaft of light fall full upon the golden allamanda the scarlet star cluster of the tacsonia or the rich deep blue of ipomaea the effect be as dream of fairyland in these great waste of forest life which abhor darkness struggle ever upwards to the light every plant even the small one curl and writhe to the green surface twine itself round its strong and tall brother in the effort climbing plant be monstrous and luxuriant but other which have never be know to climb elsewhere learn the art as an escape from that somber shadow so that the common nettle the jasmine and even the jacitara palm tree can be see circle the stem of the cedar and strive to reach their crown of animal life there be no movement amid the majestic vault aisle which stretch from we as we walk but constant movement far above our head tell of that multitudinous world of snake and monkey bird and sloth which live in the sunshine and look down in wonder at our tiny dark stumble figure in the obscure depth immeasurably below they at dawn and at sunset the howler monkey scream together and the parrakeet break into shrill chatter but during the hot hour of the day only the full drone of insect like the beat of distant surf fill the ear while nothing move amid the solemn vista of stupendous trunk fade away into the darkness which hold we in once some bandy legged lurch creature an ant eater or bear scuttle clumsily amid the shadow it be the only sign of earth life which see in this great amazonian forest and yet there be indication that even human life itself be not far from we in those mysterious recess on the third day out we be aware of singular deep throbbing in the air rhythmic and solemn come and go fitfully throughout the morning the two boat be paddle within few yard of each other when first we hear it and our indians remain motionless as if they have be turn to bronze listen intently with expression of terror upon their face "what be it then ask "drums say lord john carelessly war drum have hear they before ""yes sir war drum say gomez the half breed wild indians bravos not mansos they watch we every mile of the way kill we if they can ""how can they watch we ask gaze into the dark motionless void the half breed shrug his broad shoulder "the indians know they have their own way they watch we they talk the drum talk to each other kill we if they can "by the afternoon of that day my pocket diary show i that it be tuesday august 18th at least six or seven drum be throb from various point sometimes they beat quickly sometimes slowly sometimes in obvious question and answer one far to the east break out in high staccato rattle and be follow after pause by deep roll from the north there be something indescribably nerve shake and menacing in that constant mutter which seem to shape itself into the very syllable of the half
