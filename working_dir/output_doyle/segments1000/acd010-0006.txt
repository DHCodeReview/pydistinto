breed endlessly repeat we will kill you if we can we will kill you if we can no one ever move in the silent wood all the peace and soothing of quiet nature lie in that dark curtain of vegetation but away from behind there come ever the one message from our fellow man we will kill you if we can say the man in the east we will kill you if we can say the man in the north all day the drum rumble and whisper while their menace reflect itself in the face of our colored companion even the hardy swagger half breed seem cow learn however that day once for all that both summerlee and challenger possess that high type of bravery the bravery of the scientific mind theirs be the spirit which uphold darwin among the gauchos of the argentine or wallace among the head hunter of malaya it be decree by merciful nature that the human brain can not think of two thing simultaneously so that if it be steep in curiosity as to science it have no room for merely personal consideration all day amid that incessant and mysterious menace our two professors watch every bird upon the wing and every shrub upon the bank with many sharp wordy contention when the snarl of summerlee come quick upon the deep growl of challenger but with no more sense of danger and no more reference to drum beat indians than if they be seat together in the smoking room of the royal society 's club in st. james 's street once only do they condescend to discuss they "miranha or amajuaca cannibal say challenger jerk his thumb towards the reverberate wood "no doubt sir summerlee answer like all such tribe shall expect to find they of poly synthetic speech and of mongolian type ""polysynthetic certainly say challenger indulgently be not aware that any other type of language exist in this continent and have note of more than hundred the mongolian theory regard with deep suspicion ""i should have think that even limited knowledge of comparative anatomy would have help to verify it say summerlee bitterly challenger thrust out his aggressive chin until he be all beard and hat rim no doubt sir limited knowledge would have that effect when one 's knowledge be exhaustive one come to other conclusion they glare at each other in mutual defiance while all round rise the distant whisper we will kill you we will kill you if we can "that night we moor our canoe with heavy stone for anchor in the center of the stream and make every preparation for possible attack nothing come however and with the dawn we push upon our way the drum beating die out behind we about three o'clock in the afternoon we come to very steep rapid more than mile long the very one in which professor challenger have suffer disaster upon his first journey confess that the sight of it console i for it be really the first direct corroboration slight as it be of the truth of his story the indians carry first our canoe and then our store through the brushwood which be very thick at this point while we four white our rifle on our shoulder walk between they and any danger come from the wood before evening we have successfully pass the rapid and make our way some ten mile above they where we anchor for the night at this point reckon that we have come not less than hundred mile up the tributary from the main stream it be in the early forenoon of the next day that we make the great departure since dawn professor challenger have be acutely uneasy continually scan each bank of the river suddenly he give an exclamation of satisfaction and point to single tree which project at peculiar angle over the side of the stream "what do you make of that he ask "it be surely an assai palm say summerlee "exactly it be an assai palm which take for my landmark the secret opening be half mile onwards upon the other side of the river there be no break in the tree that be the wonder and the mystery of it there where you see light green rush instead of dark green undergrowth there between the great cotton wood that be my private gate into the unknown push through and you will understand "it be indeed wonderful place having reach the spot mark by line of light green rush we pole out two canoe through they for some hundred of yard and eventually emerge into placid and shallow stream run clear and transparent over sandy bottom it may have be twenty yard across and be bank in on each side by most luxuriant vegetation no one who have not observe that for short distance reed have take the place of shrub could possibly have guess the existence of such stream or dream of the fairyland beyond for fairyland it be the most wonderful that the imagination of man could conceive the thick vegetation meet overhead interlace into natural pergola and through this tunnel of verdure in golden twilight flow the green pellucid river beautiful in itself but marvelous from the strange tint throw by the vivid light from above filter and temper in its fall clear as crystal motionless as sheet of glass green as the edge of an iceberg it stretch in front of we under its leafy archway every stroke of our paddle send thousand ripple across its shine surface it be fitting avenue to land of wonder all sign of the indians have pass away but animal life be more frequent and the tameness of the creature show that they know nothing of the hunter fuzzy little black velvet monkey with snow white tooth and gleaming mock eye chatter at we as we pass with dull heavy splash an occasional cayman plunge in from the bank once dark clumsy tapir stare at we from gap in the bush and then lumber away through the forest once too the yellow sinuous form of great puma whisk amid the brushwood and its green baleful eye glare hatred at we over its tawny shoulder bird life be abundant especially the wade bird stork heron and ibis gathering in little group blue scarlet and white upon every log which jut from the bank while beneath we the crystal water be alive with fish of every shape and color for three day we make our way up this tunnel of hazy green sunshine on the long stretch one could hardly tell as one look ahead where the distant green water end and the distant green archway begin the deep peace of this strange waterway be unbroken by any sign of man "no indian here too much afraid curupuri say gomez "curupuri be the spirit of the wood lord john explain it be name for any kind of devil the poor beggar think that there be something fearsome in this direction and therefore they avoid it "on the third day it become evident that our journey in the canoe could not last much long for the stream be rapidly grow more shallow twice in as many hour we stick upon the bottom finally we pull the boat up among the brushwood and spend the night on the bank of the river in the morning lord john and make our way for couple of mile through the forest keep parallel with the stream but as it grow ever shallow we return and report what professor challenger have already suspect that we have reach the high point to which the canoe could be bring we draw they up therefore and conceal they among the bush blaze tree with our axis so that we should find they again then we distribute the various burden among we gun ammunition food tent blanket and the rest and shoulder our package we set forth upon the more laborious stage of our journey an unfortunate quarrel between our pepper pot mark the outset of our new stage challenger have from the moment of join we issue direction to the whole party much to the evident discontent of summerlee now upon his assign some duty to his fellow professor it be only the carrying of an aneroid barometer the matter suddenly come to head "may ask sir say summerlee with vicious calm in what capacity you take it upon yourself to issue these orders?"challenger glare and bristle "i do it professor summerlee as leader of this expedition ""i be compel to tell you sir that do not recognize you in that capacity ""indeed challenger bow with unwieldy sarcasm perhaps you would define my exact position ""yes sir you be man whose veracity be upon trial and this committee be here to try it you walk sir with your judge ""dear i say challenger seat himself on the side of one of the canoe in that case you will of course go on your way and will follow at my leisure if be not the leader you can not expect i to lead "thank heaven that there be two sane man lord john roxton and myself to prevent the petulance and folly of our learn professors from send we back empty handed to london such arguing and plead and explain before we could get they mollify then at last summerlee with his sneer and his pipe would move forwards and challenger would come roll and grumble after by some good fortune we discover about this time that both our savant have the very poor opinion of dr. illingworth of edinburgh thenceforward that be our one safety and every strained situation be relieve by our introduce the name of the scotch zoologist when both our professor would form temporary alliance and friendship in their detestation and abuse of this common rival advance in single file along the bank of the stream we soon find that it narrow down to mere brook and finally that it lose itself in great green morass of sponge like moss into which we sink up to our knee the place be horribly haunt by cloud of mosquito and every form of fly pest so we be glad to find solid ground again and to make circuit among the tree which enable we to outflank this pestilent morass which drone like an organ in the distance so loud be it with insect life on the second day after leave our canoe we find that the whole character of the country change our road be persistently upwards and as we ascend the wood become thin and lose their tropical luxuriance the huge tree of the alluvial amazonian plain give place to the phoenix and coco palm grow in scatter clump with thick brushwood between in the damper hollow the mauritia palm throw out their graceful drooping frond we travel entirely by compass and once or twice there be difference of opinion between challenger and the two indians when to quote the professor 's indignant word the whole party agree to trust the fallacious instinct of undeveloped savage rather than the high product of modern european culture that we be justify in do so be show upon the third day when challenger admit that he recognize several landmark of his former journey and in one spot we actually come upon four fire blacken stone which must have mark camping place the road still ascend and we cross rock stud slope which take two day to traverse the vegetation have again change and only the vegetable ivory tree remain with great profusion of wonderful orchid among which learn to recognize the rare nuttonia vexillaria and the glorious pink and scarlet blossom of cattleya and odontoglossum occasional brook with pebbly bottom and fern drape bank gurgle down the shallow gorge in the hill and offer good camping ground every evening on the bank of some rock stud pool where swarm of little blue back fish about the size and shape of english trout give we delicious supper on the ninth day after leave the canoe having do as reckon about hundred and twenty mile we begin to emerge from the tree which have grow small until they be mere shrub their place be take by an immense wilderness of bamboo which grow so thickly that we could only penetrate it by cut pathway with the machete and billhook of the indians it take we long day travel from seven in the morning till eight at night with only two break of one hour each to get through this obstacle anything more monotonous and weary could not be imagine for even at the most open place could not see more than ten or twelve yard while usually my vision be limit to the back of lord john 's cotton jacket in front of i and to the yellow wall within foot of i on either side from above come one thin knife edge of sunshine and fifteen foot over our head one see the top of the reed sway against the deep blue sky do not know what kind of creature inhabit such thicket but several time we hear the plunging of large heavy animal quite close to we from their sound lord john judge they to be some form of wild cattle just as night fall we clear the belt of bamboo and at once form our camp exhaust by the interminable day early next morning we be again afoot and find that the character of the country have change once again behind we be the wall of bamboo as definite as if it mark the course of river in front be an open plain slope slightly upwards and dot with clump of tree fern the whole curve before we until it end in long whale back ridge this we reach about midday only to find shallow valley beyond rise once again into gentle incline which lead to low rounded sky line it be here while we cross the first of these hill that an incident occur which may or may not have be important professor challenger who with the two local indians be in the van of the party stop suddenly and point excitedly to the right as he do so we see at the distance of mile or so something which appear to be huge gray bird flap slowly up from the ground and skim smoothly off fly very low and straight until it be lose among the tree fern "did you see it cry challenger in exultation summerlee do you see it?"his colleague be stare at the spot where the creature have disappear "what do you claim that it be he ask "to the good of my belief pterodactyl "summerlee burst into derisive laughter pter fiddlestick say he it be stork if ever see one "challenger be too furious to speak he simply swing his pack upon his back and continue upon his march lord john come abreast of i however and his face be more grave than be his wo nt he have his zeiss glass in his hand "i focus it before it get over the tree say he wo n't undertake to say what it be but 'll risk my reputation as sportsman that it be n't any bird that ever clap eye on in my life "so there the matter stand be we really just at the edge of the unknown encounter the outlying picket of this lose world of which our leader speak give you the incident as it occur and you will know as much as do it stand alone for we see nothing more which could be call remarkable and now my reader if ever have any have bring you up the broad river and through the screen of rush and down the green tunnel and up the long slope of palm tree and through the bamboo brake and across the plain of tree fern at last our destination lie in full sight of we when we have cross the second ridge we see before we an irregular palm stud plain and then the line of high red cliff which have see in the picture there it lie even as write and there can be no question that it be the same at the near point it be about seven mile from our present camp and it curve away stretch as far as can see challenger strut about like prize peacock and summerlee be silent but still sceptical another day should bring some of our doubt to an end meanwhile as jose whose arm be pierce by break bamboo insist upon return send this letter back in his charge and only hope that it may eventually come to hand will write again as the occasion serve have enclose with this rough chart of our journey which may have the effect of make the account rather easy to understand dreadful thing have happen to we who could have foresee it can not foresee any end to our trouble it may be that we be condemn to spend our whole life in this strange inaccessible place be still so confused that can hardly think clearly of the fact of the present or of the chance of the future to my astounded sense the one seem most terrible and the other as black as night no man have ever find themselves in bad position nor be there any use in disclose to you our exact geographical situation and ask our friend for relief party even if they could send one our fate will in all human probability be decide long before it could arrive in south america we be in truth as far from any human aid as if we be in the moon if we be to win through it be only our own quality which can save we have as companion three remarkable man man of great brain power and of unshaken courage there lie our one and only hope it be only when look upon the untroubled face of my comrade that see some glimmer through the darkness outwardly trust that appear as unconcerned as they inwardly be fill with apprehension let i give you with as much detail as can the sequence of event which have lead we to this catastrophe when finish my last letter state that we be within seven mile from an enormous line of ruddy cliff which encircle beyond all doubt the plateau of which professor challenger speak their height as we approach they seem to i in some place to be great than he have state run up in part to at least thousand foot and they be curiously striate in manner which be believe characteristic of basaltic upheaval something of the sort be to be see in salisbury crags at edinburgh the summit show every sign of luxuriant vegetation with bush near the edge and far back many high tree there be no indication of any life that we could see that night we pitch our camp immediately under the cliff most wild and desolate spot the crag above we be not merely perpendicular but curved outward at the top so that ascent be out of the question close to we be the high thin pinnacle of rock which believe mention early in this narrative it be like broad red church spire the top of it be level with the plateau but great chasm gape between on the summit of it there grow one high tree both pinnacle and cliff be comparatively low some five or six hundred foot should think "it be on that say professor challenger point to this tree that the pterodactyl be perch climb half way up the rock before shoot he be inclined to think that good mountaineer like myself could ascend the rock to the top though he would of course be no nearer to the plateau when he have do so "as challenger speak of his pterodactyl glance at professor summerlee and for the first time seem to see some sign of dawn credulity and repentance there be no sneer upon his thin lip but on the contrary gray draw look of excitement and amazement challenger see it too and revel in the first taste of victory "of course say he with his clumsy and ponderous sarcasm professor summerlee will understand that when speak of pterodactyl mean stork only it be the kind of stork which have no feather leathery skin membranous wing and tooth in its jaw he grin and blink and bow until his colleague turn and walk away in the morning after frugal breakfast of coffee and manioc we have to be economical of our store we hold council of war as to the good method of ascend to the plateau above we challenger preside with solemnity as if he be the lord chief justice on the bench picture he seat upon rock his absurd boyish straw hat tilt on the back of his head his supercilious eye dominate we from under his drooping lid his great black beard wag as he slowly define our present situation and our future movement beneath he you might have see the three of we myself sunburnt young and vigorous after our open air tramp summerlee solemn but still critical behind his eternal pipe lord john as keen as razor edge with his supple alert figure lean upon his rifle and his eager eye fix eagerly upon the speaker behind we be group the two swarthy half breed and the little knot of indians while in front and above we tower those huge ruddy rib of rock which keep we from our goal "i need not say say our leader that on the occasion of my last visit exhaust every mean of climb the cliff and where fail do not think that anyone else be likely to succeed for be something of mountaineer have none of the appliance of rock climber with i but have take the precaution to bring they now with their aid be positive could climb that detach pinnacle to the summit but so long as the main cliff overhang it be vain to attempt ascend that be hurry upon my last visit by the approach of the rainy season and by the exhaustion of my supply these consideration limit my time and can only claim that have survey about six mile of the cliff to the east of we find no possible way up what then shall we now do?""there seem to be only one reasonable course say professor summerlee if you have explore the east we should travel along the base of the cliff to the west and seek for practicable point for our ascent ""that be it say lord john the odd be that this plateau be of no great size and we shall travel round it until we either find an easy way up it or come back to the point from which we start ""i have already explain to our young friend here say challenger he have way of allude to i as if be school child ten year old that it be quite impossible that there should be an easy way up anywhere for the simple reason that if there be the summit would not be isolate and those condition would not obtain which have effect so singular an interference with the general law of survival yet admit that there may very well be place where an expert human climber may reach the summit and yet cumbrous and heavy animal be unable to descend it be certain that there be point where an ascent be possible ""how do you know that sir ask summerlee sharply "because my predecessor the american maple white actually make such an ascent how otherwise could he have see the monster which he sketch in his notebook?""there you reason somewhat ahead of the proved fact say the stubborn summerlee admit your plateau because have see it but have not as yet satisfy myself that it contain any form of life whatever ""what you admit sir or what you do not admit be really of inconceivably small importance be glad to perceive that the plateau itself have actually obtrude itself upon your intelligence he glance up at it and then to our amazement he spring from his rock and seize summerlee by the neck he tilt his face into the air now sir he shout hoarse with excitement do help you to realize that the plateau contain some animal life?"i have say that thick fringe of green overhang the edge of the cliff out of this there have emerge black glistening object as it come slowly forth and overhang the chasm we see that it be very large snake with peculiar flat spade like head it waver and quiver above we for minute the morning sun gleam upon its
