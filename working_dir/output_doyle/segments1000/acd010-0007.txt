sleek sinuous coil then it slowly draw inward and disappear summerlee have be so interested that he have stand unresiste while challenger tilt his head into the air now he shake his colleague off and come back to his dignity "i should be glad professor challenger say he if you could see your way to make any remark which may occur to you without seize i by the chin even the appearance of very ordinary rock python do not appear to justify such liberty ""but there be life upon the plateau all the same his colleague reply in triumph and now having demonstrate this important conclusion so that it be clear to anyone however prejudiced or obtuse be of opinion that we can not do well than break up our camp and travel to westward until we find some mean of ascent "the ground at the foot of the cliff be rocky and break so that the going be slow and difficult suddenly we come however upon something which cheer our heart it be the site of an old encampment with several empty chicago meat tin bottle label brandy broken tin opener and quantity of other traveler debris crumpled disintegrate newspaper reveal itself as the chicago democrat though the date have be obliterate "not mine say challenger it must be maple white's "lord john have be gaze curiously at great tree fern which overshadow the encampment say look at this say he believe it be mean for sign post "a slip of hard wood have be nail to the tree in such way as to point to the westward "most certainly sign post say challenger what else find himself upon dangerous errand our pioneer have leave this sign so that any party which follow he may know the way he have take perhaps we shall come upon some other indication as we proceed "we do indeed but they be of terrible and most unexpected nature immediately beneath the cliff there grow considerable patch of high bamboo like that which we have traverse in our journey many of these stem be twenty foot high with sharp strong top so that even as they stand they make formidable spear we be pass along the edge of this cover when my eye be catch by the gleam of something white within it thrust in my head between the stem find myself gaze at fleshless skull the whole skeleton be there but the skull have detach itself and lie some foot near to the open with few blow from the machete of our indians we clear the spot and be able to study the detail of this old tragedy only few shred of clothe could still be distinguish but there be the remain of boot upon the bony foot and it be very clear that the dead man be european gold watch by hudson of new york and chain which hold stylographic pen lie among the bone there be also silver cigarette case with j. c. from a. e. s. upon the lid the state of the metal seem to show that the catastrophe have occur no great time before "who can he be ask lord john poor devil every bone in his body seem to be break ""and the bamboo grow through his smash rib say summerlee it be fast grow plant but it be surely inconceivable that this body could have be here while the cane grow to be twenty foot in length ""as to the man 's identity say professor challenger have no doubt whatever upon that point as make my way up the river before reach you at the fazenda institute very particular inquiry about maple white at para they know nothing fortunately have definite clew for there be particular picture in his sketch book which show he take lunch with certain ecclesiastic at rosario this priest be able to find and though he prove very argumentative fellow who take it absurdly amiss that should point out to he the corrosive effect which modern science must have upon his belief he none the less give i some positive information maple white pass rosario four year ago or two year before see his dead body he be not alone at the time but there be friend an american name james colver who remain in the boat and do not meet this ecclesiastic think therefore that there can be no doubt that we be now look upon the remain of this james colver ""nor say lord john be there much doubt as to how he meet his death he have fall or be chuck from the top and so be impale how else could he come by his broken bone and how could he have be stick through by these cane with their point so high above our heads?"a hush come over we as we stand round these shatter remain and realize the truth of lord john roxton 's word the beetling head of the cliff project over the cane brake undoubtedly he have fall from above but have he fall have it be an accident or already ominous and terrible possibility begin to form round that unknown land we move off in silence and continue to coast round the line of cliff which be as even and unbroken as some of those monstrous antarctic ice field which have seen depict as stretch from horizon to horizon and tower high above the mast head of the explore vessel in five mile we see no rift or break and then suddenly we perceive something which fill we with new hope in hollow of the rock protect from rain there be draw rough arrow in chalk point still to the westward "maple white again say professor challenger he have some presentiment that worthy footstep would follow close behind he ""he have chalk then?""a box of colored chalk be among the effect find in his knapsack remember that the white one be wear to stump ""that be certainly good evidence say summerlee we can only accept his guidance and follow on to the westward "we have proceed some five more mile when again we see white arrow upon the rock it be at point where the face of the cliff be for the first time split into narrow cleft inside the cleft be second guidance mark which point right up it with the tip somewhat elevate as if the spot indicate be above the level of the ground it be solemn place for the wall be so gigantic and the slit of blue sky so narrow and so obscure by double fringe of verdure that only dim and shadowy light penetrate to the bottom we have have no food for many hour and be very weary with the stony and irregular journey but our nerve be too string to allow we to halt we order the camp to be pitch however and leave the indians to arrange it we four with the two half breed proceed up the narrow gorge it be not more than forty foot across at the mouth but it rapidly close until it end in an acute angle too straight and smooth for an ascent certainly it be not this which our pioneer have attempt to indicate we make our way back the whole gorge be not more than quarter of mile deep and then suddenly the quick eye of lord john fall upon what we be seek high up above our head amid the dark shadow there be one circle of deep gloom surely it could only be the opening of cave the base of the cliff be heap with loose stone at the spot and it be not difficult to clamber up when we reach it all doubt be remove not only be it an opening into the rock but on the side of it there be mark once again the sign of the arrow here be the point and this the mean by which maple white and his ill fate comrade have make their ascent we be too excited to return to the camp but must make our first exploration at once lord john have an electric torch in his knapsack and this have to serve we as light he advance throw his little clear circlet of yellow radiance before he while in single file we follow at his heel the cave have evidently be water wear the side be smooth and the floor cover with rounded stone it be of such size that single man could just fit through by stoop for fifty yard it run almost straight into the rock and then it ascend at an angle of forty five presently this incline become even steep and we find ourselves climb upon hand and knee among loose rubble which slide from beneath we suddenly an exclamation break from lord roxton "it be block say he cluster behind he we see in the yellow field of light wall of break basalt which extend to the ceiling "the roof have fall in!"in vain we drag out some of the piece the only effect be that the large one become detach and threaten to roll down the gradient and crush we it be evident that the obstacle be far beyond any effort which we could make to remove it the road by which maple white have ascend be no long available too much cast down to speak we stumble down the dark tunnel and make our way back to the camp one incident occur however before we leave the gorge which be of importance in view of what come afterwards we have gather in little group at the bottom of the chasm some forty foot beneath the mouth of the cave when huge rock roll suddenly downwards and shoot past we with tremendous force it be the narrow escape for one or all of we we could not ourselves see whence the rock have come but our half breed servant who be still at the opening of the cave say that it have fly past they and must therefore have fall from the summit look upwards we could see no sign of movement above we amidst the green jungle which top the cliff there could be little doubt however that the stone be aim at we so the incident surely point to humanity and malevolent humanity upon the plateau we withdraw hurriedly from the chasm our mind full of this new development and its bearing upon our plan the situation be difficult enough before but if the obstruction of nature be increase by the deliberate opposition of man then our case be indeed hopeless one and yet as we look up at that beautiful fringe of verdure only few hundred of foot above our head there be not one of we who could conceive the idea of return to london until we have explore it to its depth on discuss the situation we determine that our good course be to continue to coast round the plateau in the hope of find some other mean of reach the top the line of cliff which have decrease considerably in height have already begin to trend from west to north and if we could take this as represent the arc of circle the whole circumference could not be very great at the bad then we should be back in few day at our starting point we make march that day which total some two and twenty mile without any change in our prospect may mention that our aneroid show we that in the continual incline which we have ascend since we abandon our canoe we have rise to no less than three thousand foot above sea level hence there be considerable change both in the temperature and in the vegetation we have shake off some of that horrible insect life which be the bane of tropical travel few palm still survive and many tree fern but the amazonian tree have be all leave behind it be pleasant to see the convolvulus the passion flower and the begonia all remind i of home here among these inhospitable rock there be red begonia just the same color as one that be keep in pot in the window of certain villa in streatham but be drift into private reminiscence that night be still speak of the first day of our circumnavigation of the plateau great experience await we and one which for ever set at rest any doubt which we could have have as to the wonder so near we you will realize as you read it my dear mr. mcardle and possibly for the first time that the paper have not send i on wild goose chase and that there be inconceivably fine copy wait for the world whenever we have the professor 's leave to make use of it shall not dare to publish these article unless can bring back my proof to england or shall be hail as the journalistic munchausen of all time have no doubt that you feel the same way yourself and that you would not care to stake the whole credit of the gazette upon this adventure until we can meet the chorus of criticism and scepticism which such article must of necessity elicit so this wonderful incident which would make such headline for the old paper must still wait its turn in the editorial drawer and yet it be all over in flash and there be no sequel to it save in our own conviction what occur be this lord john have shoot an ajouti which be small pig like animal and half of it having be give to the indians we be cook the other half upon our fire there be chill in the air after dark and we have all draw close to the blaze the night be moonless but there be some star and one could see for little distance across the plain well suddenly out of the darkness out of the night there swoop something with swish like an aeroplane the whole group of we be cover for an instant by canopy of leathery wing and have momentary vision of long snake like neck fierce red greedy eye and great snapping beak fill to my amazement with little gleam tooth the next instant it be go and so be our dinner huge black shadow twenty foot across skim up into the air for an instant the monster wing blot out the star and then it vanish over the brow of the cliff above we we all sit in amazed silence round the fire like the hero of virgil when the harpies come down upon they it be summerlee who be the first to speak "professor challenger say he in solemn voice which quaver with emotion owe you an apology sir be very much in the wrong and beg that you will forget what be past "it be handsomely say and the two man for the first time shake hand so much we have gain by this clear vision of our first pterodactyl it be worth steal supper to bring two such man together but if prehistoric life exist upon the plateau it be not superabundant for we have no further glimpse of it during the next three day during this time we traverse barren and forbid country which alternate between stony desert and desolate marsh full of many wild fowl upon the north and east of the cliff from that direction the place be really inaccessible and be it not for hardish ledge which run at the very base of the precipice we should have have to turn back many time we be up to our waist in the slime and blubber of an old semi tropical swamp to make matter bad the place seem to be favorite breeding place of the jaracaca snake the most venomous and aggressive in south america again and again these horrible creature come writhe and spring towards we across the surface of this putrid bog and it be only by keep our shot gun for ever ready that we could feel safe from they one funnel shape depression in the morass of livid green in color from some lichen which fester in it will always remain as nightmare memory in my mind it seem to have be special nest of these vermin and the slope be alive with they all writhe in our direction for it be peculiarity of the jaracaca that he will always attack man at first sight there be too many for we to shoot so we fairly take to our heel and run until we be exhausted shall always remember as we look back how far behind we could see the head and neck of our horrible pursuer rise and fall amid the reed jaracaca swamp we name it in the map which we be construct the cliff upon the farther side have lose their ruddy tint be chocolate brown in color the vegetation be more scatter along the top of they and they have sink to three or four hundred foot in height but in no place do we find any point where they could be ascend if anything they be more impossible than at the first point where we have meet they their absolute steepness be indicate in the photograph which take over the stony desert "surely say as we discuss the situation the rain must find its way down somehow there be bind to be water channel in the rock ""our young friend have glimpse of lucidity say professor challenger pat i upon the shoulder "the rain must go somewhere repeat "he keep firm grip upon actuality the only drawback be that we have conclusively prove by ocular demonstration that there be no water channel down the rock ""where then do it go persist "i think it may be fairly assume that if it do not come outward it must run inwards ""then there be lake in the center ""so should suppose ""it be more than likely that the lake may be an old crater say summerlee the whole formation be of course highly volcanic but however that may be should expect to find the surface of the plateau slope inward with considerable sheet of water in the center which may drain off by some subterranean channel into the marsh of the jaracaca swamp ""or evaporation might preserve an equilibrium remark challenger and the two learn man wander off into one of their usual scientific argument which be as comprehensible as chinese to the layman on the sixth day we complete our first circuit of the cliff and find ourselves back at the first camp beside the isolated pinnacle of rock we be disconsolate party for nothing could have be more minute than our investigation and it be absolutely certain that there be no single point where the most active human being could possibly hope to scale the cliff the place which maple white 's chalk mark have indicate as his own mean of access be now entirely impassable what be we to do now our store of provision supplement by our gun be hold out well but the day must come when they would need replenishment in couple of month the rain might be expect and we should be wash out of our camp the rock be hard than marble and any attempt at cut path for so great height be more than our time or resource would admit no wonder that we look gloomily at each other that night and seek our blanket with hardly word exchange remember that as drop off to sleep my last recollection be that challenger be squat like monstrous bull frog by the fire his huge head in his hand sink apparently in the deep thought and entirely oblivious to the good night which wish he but it be very different challenger who greet we in the morning challenger with contentment and self congratulation shine from his whole person he face we as we assemble for breakfast with deprecate false modesty in his eye as who should say know that deserve all that you can say but pray you to spare my blush by not say it his beard bristle exultantly his chest be throw out and his hand be thrust into the front of his jacket so in his fancy may he see himself sometimes grace the vacant pedestal in trafalgar square and add one more to the horror of the london street "eureka he cry his tooth shine through his beard gentleman you may congratulate i and we may congratulate each other the problem be solve ""you have find way up?""i venture to think so ""and where?"for answer he point to the spire like pinnacle upon our right our face or mine at least fall as we survey it that it could be climb we have our companion 's assurance but horrible abyss lie between it and the plateau "we can never get across gasp "we can at least all reach the summit say he when we be up may be able to show you that the resource of an inventive mind be not yet exhausted "after breakfast we unpack the bundle in which our leader have bring his climbing accessory from it he take coil of the strong and light rope hundred and fifty foot in length with climbing iron clamp and other device lord john be an experienced mountaineer and summerlee have do some rough climbing at various time so that be really the novice at rock work of the party but my strength and activity may have make up for my want of experience it be not in reality very stiff task though there be moment which make my hair bristle upon my head the first half be perfectly easy but from there upwards it become continually steep until for the last fifty foot we be literally cling with our finger and toe to tiny ledge and crevice in the rock could not have accomplish it nor could summerlee if challenger have not gain the summit it be extraordinary to see such activity in so unwieldy creature and there fix the rope round the trunk of the considerable tree which grow there with this as our support we be soon able to scramble up the jagged wall until we find ourselves upon the small grassy platform some twenty five foot each way which form the summit the first impression which receive when have recover my breath be of the extraordinary view over the country which we have traverse the whole brazilian plain seem to lie beneath we extend away and away until it end in dim blue mist upon the farth sky line in the foreground be the long slope strew with rock and dot with tree fern far off in the middle distance look over the saddle back hill could just see the yellow and green mass of bamboo through which we have pass and then gradually the vegetation increase until it form the huge forest which extend as far as the eye could reach and for good two thousand mile beyond be still drink in this wonderful panorama when the heavy hand of the professor fall upon my shoulder "this way my young friend say he vestigia nulla retrorsum never look rearward but always to our glorious goal "the level of the plateau when turn be exactly that on which we stand and the green bank of bush with occasional tree be so near that it be difficult to realize how inaccessible it remain at rough guess the gulf be forty foot across but so far as could see it might as well have be forty mile place one arm round the trunk of the tree and lean over the abyss far down be the small dark figure of our servant look up at we the wall be absolutely precipitous as be that which face i "this be indeed curious say the creak voice of professor summerlee turn and find that he be examine with great interest the tree to which clung that smooth bark and those small ribbed leave seem familiar to my eye why cry it be beech!""exactly say summerlee fellow countryman in far land ""not only fellow countryman my good sir say challenger but also if may be allow to enlarge your simile an ally of the first value this beech tree will be our saviour ""by george cry lord john bridge!""exactly my friend bridge it be not for nothing that expend an hour last night in focus my mind upon the situation have some recollection of once remark to our young friend here that g. e. c. be at his good when his back be to the wall last night you will admit that all our back be to the wall but where will power and intellect go together there be always way out drawbridge have to be find which could be drop across the abyss behold it!"it be certainly brilliant idea the tree be good sixty foot
