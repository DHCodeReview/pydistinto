in height and if it only fall the right way it would easily cross the chasm challenger have sling the camp axe over his shoulder when he ascend now he hand it to i "our young friend have the thew and sinew say he think he will be the most useful at this task must beg however that you will kindly refrain from think for yourself and that you will do exactly what you be tell "under his direction cut such gash in the side of the tree as would ensure that it should fall as we desire it have already strong natural tilt in the direction of the plateau so that the matter be not difficult finally set to work in earnest upon the trunk take turn and turn with lord john in little over an hour there be loud crack the tree sway forward and then crash over bury its branch among the bush on the farther side the severed trunk roll to the very edge of our platform and for one terrible second we all think it be over it balance itself however few inch from the edge and there be our bridge to the unknown all of we without word shake hand with professor challenger who raise his straw hat and bow deeply to each in turn "i claim the honor say he to be the first to cross to the unknown land fitting subject no doubt for some future historical painting "he have approach the bridge when lord john lay his hand upon his coat "my dear chap say he really can not allow it ""cannot allow it sir the head go back and the beard forward "when it be matter of science do n't you know follow your lead because you be by way of bein man of science but it be up to you to follow i when you come into my department ""your department sir?""we all have our profession and soldierin be mine we be accordin to my idea invadin new country which may or may not be chock full of enemy of sort to barge blindly into it for want of little common sense and patience be n't my notion of management "the remonstrance be too reasonable to be disregard challenger toss his head and shrug his heavy shoulder "well sir what do you propose?""for all know there may be tribe of cannibal waitin for lunch time among those very bush say lord john look across the bridge it be well to learn wisdom before you get into cookin'-pot so we will content ourselves with hopin that there be no trouble waitin for we and at the same time we will act as if there be malone and will go down again therefore and we will fetch up the four rifle together with gomez and the other one man can then go across and the rest will cover he with gun until he see that it be safe for the whole crowd to come along "challenger sit down upon the cut stump and groan his impatience but summerlee and be of one mind that lord john be our leader when such practical detail be in question the climb be more simple thing now that the rope dangle down the face of the bad part of the ascent within an hour we have bring up the rifle and shot gun the half breed have ascend also and under lord john 's order they have carry up bale of provision in case our first exploration should be long one we have each bandolier of cartridge "now challenger if you really insist upon be the first man in say lord john when every preparation be complete "i be much indebted to you for your gracious permission say the angry professor for never be man so intolerant of every form of authority since you be good enough to allow it shall most certainly take it upon myself to act as pioneer upon this occasion "seate himself with leg overhang the abyss on each side and his hatchet sling upon his back challenger hop his way across the trunk and be soon at the other side he clamber up and wave his arm in the air "at last he cry at last!"i gaze anxiously at he with vague expectation that some terrible fate would dart at he from the curtain of green behind he but all be quiet save that strange many color bird fly up from under his foot and vanish among the tree summerlee be the second his wiry energy be wonderful in so frail frame he insist upon have two rifle sling upon his back so that both professors be armed when he have make his transit come next and try hard not to look down into the horrible gulf over which be pass summerlee hold out the butt end of his rifle and an instant later be able to grasp his hand as to lord john he walk across actually walk without support he must have nerve of iron and there we be the four of we upon the dreamland the lost world of maple white to all of we it seem the moment of our supreme triumph who could have guess that it be the prelude to our supreme disaster let i say in few word how the crush blow fall upon we we have turn away from the edge and have penetrate about fifty yard of close brushwood when there come frightful rend crash from behind we with one impulse we rush back the way that we have come the bridge be gone!far down at the base of the cliff see as look over tangled mass of branch and splinter trunk it be our beech tree have the edge of the platform crumble and let it through for moment this explanation be in all our mind the next from the farther side of the rocky pinnacle before we swarthy face the face of gomez the half breed be slowly protrude yes it be gomez but no long the gomez of the demure smile and the mask like expression here be face with flash eye and distorted feature face convulse with hatred and with the mad joy of gratified revenge "lord roxton he shout lord john roxton!""well say our companion here be "a shriek of laughter come across the abyss "yes there you be you english dog and there you will remain have wait and wait and now have come my chance you find it hard to get up you will find it hard to get down you curse fool you be trap every one of you!"we be too astounded to speak we could only stand there stare in amazement great broken bough upon the grass show whence he have gain his leverage to tilt over our bridge the face have vanish but presently it be up again more frantic than before "we nearly kill you with stone at the cave he cry but this be well it be slow and more terrible your bone will whiten up there and none will know where you lie or come to cover they as you lie die think of lopez whom you shoot five year ago on the putomayo river be his brother and come what will will die happy now for his memory have be avenge furious hand be shake at we and then all be quiet have the half breed simply work his vengeance and then escape all might have be well with he it be that foolish irresistible latin impulse to be dramatic which bring his own downfall roxton the man who have earn himself the name of the flail of the lord through three country be not one who could be safely taunt the half breed be descend on the farther side of the pinnacle but before he could reach the ground lord john have run along the edge of the plateau and gain point from which he could see his man there be single crack of his rifle and though we see nothing we hear the scream and then the distant thud of the fall body roxton come back to we with face of granite "i have be blind simpleton say he bitterly it be my folly that have bring you all into this trouble should have remember that these people have long memory for blood feud and have be more upon my guard ""what about the other one it take two of they to lever that tree over the edge ""i could have shoot he but let he go he may have have no part in it perhaps it would have be well if have kill he for he must as you say have lend hand "now that we have the clue to his action each of we could cast back and remember some sinister act upon the part of the half breed his constant desire to know our plan his arrest outside our tent when he be over hear they the furtive look of hatred which from time to time one or other of we have surprise we be still discuss it endeavor to adjust our mind to these new condition when singular scene in the plain below arrest our attention man in white clothe who could only be the survive half breed be run as one do run when death be the pacemaker behind he only few yard in his rear bound the huge ebony figure of zambo our devoted negro even as we look he spring upon the back of the fugitive and fling his arm round his neck they roll on the ground together an instant afterwards zambo rise look at the prostrate man and then wave his hand joyously to we came run in our direction the white figure lie motionless in the middle of the great plain our two traitor have be destroy but the mischief that they have done live after they by no possible mean could we get back to the pinnacle we have be native of the world now we be native of the plateau the two thing be separate and apart there be the plain which lead to the canoe yonder beyond the violet hazy horizon be the stream which lead back to civilization but the link between be miss no human ingenuity could suggest means of bridge the chasm which yawn between ourselves and our past life one instant have alter the whole condition of our existence it be at such moment that learn the stuff of which my three comrade be compose they be grave it be true and thoughtful but of an invincible serenity for the moment we could only sit among the bush in patience and wait the coming of zambo presently his honest black face top the rock and his herculean figure emerge upon the top of the pinnacle "what do now he cry you tell i and do it "it be question which it be easy to ask than to answer one thing only be clear he be our one trusty link with the outside world on no account must he leave we "no no he cry not leave you whatever come you always find i here but no able to keep indians already they say too much curupuri live on this place and they go home now you leave they i no able to keep they "it be fact that our indians have show in many way of late that they be weary of their journey and anxious to return we realize that zambo speak the truth and that it would be impossible for he to keep they "make they wait till to morrow zambo shout then can send letter back by they ""very good sarr promise they wait till to morrow say the negro but what do for you now?"there be plenty for he to do and admirably the faithful fellow do it first of all under our direction he undo the rope from the tree stump and throw one end of it across to we it be not thick than clothe line but it be of great strength and though we could not make bridge of it we might well find it invaluable if we have any climbing to do he then fasten his end of the rope to the package of supply which have be carry up and we be able to drag it across this give we the mean of life for at least week even if we find nothing else finally he descend and carry up two other packet of mixed good box of ammunition and number of other thing all of which we get across by throw our rope to he and haul it back it be evening when he at last climb down with final assurance that he would keep the indians till next morning and so it be that have spend nearly the whole of this our first night upon the plateau write up our experience by the light of single candle lantern we sup and camp at the very edge of the cliff quench our thirst with two bottle of apollinaris which be in one of the case it be vital to we to find water but think even lord john himself have have adventure enough for one day and none of we feel inclined to make the first push into the unknown we forbore to light fire or to make any unnecessary sound to morrow or to day rather for it be already dawn as write we shall make our first venture into this strange land when shall be able to write again or if ever shall write again know not meanwhile can see that the indians be still in their place and be sure that the faithful zambo will be here presently to get my letter only trust that it will come to hand p.s. the more think the more desperate do our position seem see no possible hope of our return if there be high tree near the edge of the plateau we might drop return bridge across but there be none within fifty yard our united strength could not carry trunk which would serve our purpose the rope of course be far too short that we could descend by it no our position be hopeless hopeless!the most wonderful thing have happen and be continually happen to we all the paper that possess consist of five old note book and lot of scrap and have only the one stylographic pencil but so long as can move my hand will continue to set down our experience and impression for since we be the only man of the whole human race to see such thing it be of enormous importance that should record they whilst they be fresh in my memory and before that fate which seem to be constantly impend do actually overtake we whether zambo can at last take these letter to the river or whether shall myself in some miraculous way carry they back with i or finally whether some daring explorer come upon our track with the advantage perhaps of perfect monoplane should find this bundle of manuscript in any case can see that what be write be destine to immortality as classic of true adventure on the morning after our be trap upon the plateau by the villainous gomez we begin new stage in our experience the first incident in it be not such as to give i very favorable opinion of the place to which we have wander as rouse myself from short nap after day have dawn my eye fall upon most singular appearance upon my own leg my trouser have slip up expose few inch of my skin above my sock on this there rest large purplish grape astonish at the sight lean forward to pick it off when to my horror it burst between my finger and thumb squirt blood in every direction my cry of disgust have bring the two professor to my side "most interesting say summerlee bend over my shin an enormous blood tick as yet believe unclassified ""the first fruit of our labor say challenger in his booming pedantic fashion we can not do less than call it ixodes maloni the very small inconvenience of be bite my young friend can not be sure weigh with you as against the glorious privilege of have your name inscribe in the deathless roll of zoology unhappily you have crush this fine speciman at the moment of satiation ""filthy vermin cry professor challenger raise his great eyebrow in protest and place soothe paw upon my shoulder "you should cultivate the scientific eye and the detach scientific mind say he to man of philosophic temperament like myself the blood tick with its lancet like proboscis and its distending stomach be as beautiful work of nature as the peacock or for that matter the aurora boreali it pain i to hear you speak of it in so unappreciative fashion no doubt with due diligence we can secure some other speciman ""there can be no doubt of that say summerlee grimly for one have just disappear behind your shirt collar "challenger spring into the air bellowing like bull and tear frantically at his coat and shirt to get they off summerlee and laugh so that we could hardly help he at last we expose that monstrous torso fifty four inch by the tailor 's tape his body be all matted with black hair out of which jungle we pick the wandering tick before it have bite he but the bush round be full of the horrible pest and it be clear that we must shift our camp but first of all it be necessary to make our arrangement with the faithful negro who appear presently on the pinnacle with number of tin of cocoa and biscuit which he toss over to we of the store which remain below he be order to retain as much as would keep he for two month the indians be to have the remainder as reward for their service and as payment for take our letter back to the amazon some hour later we see they in single file far out upon the plain each with bundle on his head make their way back along the path we have come zambo occupy our little tent at the base of the pinnacle and there he remain our one link with the world below and now we have to decide upon our immediate movement we shift our position from among the tick laden bush until we come to small clearing thickly surround by tree upon all side there be some flat slab of rock in the center with an excellent well close by and there we sit in cleanly comfort while we make our first plan for the invasion of this new country bird be call among the foliage especially one with peculiar whooping cry which be new to we but beyond these sound there be no sign of life our first care be to make some sort of list of our own store so that we might know what we have to rely upon what with the thing we have ourselves bring up and those which zambo have send across on the rope we be fairly well supplied most important of all in view of the danger which might surround we we have our four rifle and one thousand three hundred round also shot gun but not more than hundred and fifty medium pellet cartridge in the matter of provision we have enough to last for several week with sufficiency of tobacco and few scientific implement include large telescope and good field glass all these thing we collect together in the clearing and as first precaution we cut down with our hatchet and knive number of thorny bush which we pile round in circle some fifteen yard in diameter this be to be our headquarters for the time our place of refuge against sudden danger and the guard house for our store fort challenger we call it it be midday before we have make ourselves secure but the heat be not oppressive and the general character of the plateau both in its temperature and in its vegetation be almost temperate the beech the oak and even the birch be to be find among the tangle of tree which girt we in one huge gingko tree top all the other shoot its great limb and maidenhair foliage over the fort which we have construct in its shade we continue our discussion while lord john who have quickly take command in the hour of action give we his view "so long as neither man nor beast have see or hear we we be safe say he from the time they know we be here our trouble begin there be no sign that they have find we out as yet so our game surely be to lie low for time and spy out the land we want to have good look at our neighbor before we get on visitin term ""but we must advance venture to remark "by all mean sonny my boy we will advance but with common sense we must never go so far that we ca n't get back to our base above all we must never unless it be life or death fire off our gun ""but you fire yesterday say summerlee "well it could n't be help however the wind be strong and blow outward it be not likely that the sound could have travel far into the plateau by the way what shall we call this place suppose it be up to we to give it name?"there be several suggestion more or less happy but challenger 's be final "it can only have one name say he it be call after the pioneer who discover it it be maple white land "maple white land it become and so it be name in that chart which have become my special task so it will trust appear in the atlas of the future the peaceful penetration of maple white land be the press subject before we we have the evidence of our own eye that the place be inhabit by some unknown creature and there be that of maple white 's sketch book to show that more dreadful and more dangerous monster might still appear that there might also prove to be human occupant and that they be of malevolent character be suggest by the skeleton impale upon the bamboo which could not have get there have it not be drop from above our situation strand without possibility of escape in such land be clearly full of danger and our reason endorse every measure of caution which lord john 's experience could suggest yet it be surely impossible that we should halt on the edge of this world of mystery when our very soul be tingle with impatience to push forward and to pluck the heart from it we therefore block the entrance to our zareba by fill it up with several thorny bush and leave our camp with the store entirely surround by this protect hedge we then slowly and cautiously set forth into the unknown follow the course of the little stream which flow from our spring as it should always serve we as guide on our return hardly have we start when we come across sign that there be indeed wonder await we after few hundred yard of thick forest contain many tree which be quite unknown to i but which summerlee who be the botanist of the party recognize as form of conifera and of cycadaceous plant which have long pass away in the world below we enter region where the stream widen out and form considerable bog high reed of peculiar type grow thickly before we which be pronounce to be equisetacea or mare's tail with tree fern scatter amongst they all of they sway in brisk wind suddenly lord john who be walk first halt with uplifted hand "look at this say he by george this must be the trail of the father of all birds!"an enormous three toe track be imprint in the soft mud before we the creature whatever it be have cross the swamp and have pass on into the forest we all stop to examine that monstrous spoor if it be indeed bird and what animal could leave such mark its foot be so much large than an ostrich be that its height upon the same scale must be enormous lord john look eagerly round he and slip two cartridge into his elephant gun "i'll stake my good name as shikarree say he that the track be fresh one the creature have not pass ten minute look how the water be still ooze into that deep print by jove see here be the mark of little one!"sure enough small track of the same general form be run parallel to
