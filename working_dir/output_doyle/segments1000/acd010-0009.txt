the large one "but what do you make of this cry professor summerlee triumphantly point to what look like the huge print of five finger human hand appear among the three toed mark "wealden cry challenger in an ecstasy 've see they in the wealden clay it be creature walk erect upon three toe foot and occasionally put one of its five fingered forepaw upon the ground not bird my dear roxton not bird ""a beast?""no reptile dinosaur nothing else could have leave such track they puzzle worthy sussex doctor some ninety year ago but who in the world could have hope hope to have see sight like that?"his word die away into whisper and we all stand in motionless amazement follow the track we have leave the morass and pass through screen of brushwood and tree beyond be an open glade and in this be five of the most extraordinary creature that have ever see crouch down among the bush we observe they at our leisure there be as say five of they two be adult and three young one in size they be enormous even the baby be as big as elephant while the two large one be far beyond all creature have ever see they have slate color skin which be scale like lizard 's and shimmer where the sun shine upon it all five be sit up balance themselves upon their broad powerful tail and their huge three toe hind foot while with their small five finger front foot they pull down the branch upon which they browse do not know that can bring their appearance home to you well than by say that they look like monstrous kangaroo twenty foot in length and with skin like black crocodile do not know how long we stay motionless gaze at this marvelous spectacle strong wind blow towards we and we be well conceal so there be no chance of discovery from time to time the little one play round their parent in unwieldy gambol the great beast bound into the air and fall with dull thud upon the earth the strength of the parent seem to be limitless for one of they have some difficulty in reach bunch of foliage which grow upon considerable sized tree put his fore leg round the trunk and tear it down as if it have be sapling the action seem as think to show not only the great development of its muscle but also the small one of its brain for the whole weight came crash down upon the top of it and it utter series of shrill yelp to show that big as it be there be limit to what it could endure the incident make it think apparently that the neighborhood be dangerous for it slowly lurch off through the wood follow by its mate and its three enormous infant we see the shimmering slaty gleam of their skin between the tree trunk and their head undulate high above the brush wood then they vanish from our sight look at my comrade lord john be stand at gaze with his finger on the trigger of his elephant gun his eager hunter 's soul shine from his fierce eye what would he not give for one such head to place between the two crossed oar above the mantelpiece in his snuggery at the albany and yet his reason hold he in for all our exploration of the wonder of this unknown land depend upon our presence be conceal from its inhabitant the two professor be in silent ecstasy in their excitement they have unconsciously seize each other by the hand and stand like two little child in the presence of marvel challenger 's cheek bunch up into seraphic smile and summerlee 's sardonic face soften for the moment into wonder and reverence "nunc dimittis he cry at last what will they say in england of this?""my dear summerlee will tell you with great confidence exactly what they will say in england say challenger they will say that you be an infernal liar and scientific charlatan exactly as you and other say of i ""in the face of photographs?""fake summerlee clumsily faked!""in the face of specimens?""ah there we may have they malone and his filthy fleet street crew may be all yelp our praise yet august the twenty eighth the day we see five live iguanodon in glade of maple white land put it down in your diary my young friend and send it to your rag ""and be ready to get the toe end of the editorial boot in return say lord john thing look bit different from the latitude of london young fellah my lad there be many man who never tell his adventure for he ca n't hope to be believe who be to blame they for this will seem bit of dream to ourselves in month or two what do you say they were?""iguanodon say summerlee you 'll find their footmark all over the hastings sand in kent and in sussex the south of england be alive with they when there be plenty of good lush green stuff to keep they go condition have change and the beast die here it seem that the condition have not change and the beast have live ""if ever we get out of this alive must have head with i say lord john lord how some of that somaliland uganda crowd would turn beautiful pea green if they see it do n't know what you chap think but it strike i that we be on mighty thin ice all this time "i have the same feeling of mystery and danger around we in the gloom of the tree there seem constant menace and as we look up into their shadowy foliage vague terror creep into one 's heart it be true that these monstrous creature which we have see be lumber inoffensive brute which be unlikely to hurt anyone but in this world of wonder what other survival might there not be what fierce active horror ready to pounce upon we from their lair among the rock or brushwood know little of prehistoric life but have clear remembrance of one book which have read in which it speak of creature who would live upon our lion and tiger as cat live upon mouse what if these also be to be find in the wood of maple white land!it be destine that on this very morning our first in the new country we be to find out what strange hazard lie around we it be loathsome adventure and one of which hate to think if as lord john say the glade of the iguanodon will remain with we as dream then surely the swamp of the pterodactyls will forever be our nightmare let i set down exactly what occur we pass very slowly through the wood partly because lord roxton act as scout before he would let we advance and partly because at every second step one or other of our professor would fall with cry of wonder before some flower or insect which present he with new type we may have travel two or three mile in all keep to the right of the line of the stream when we come upon considerable opening in the tree belt of brushwood lead up to tangle of rock the whole plateau be strew with boulder we be walk slowly towards these rock among bush which reach over our waist when we become aware of strange low gabbling and whistle sound which fill the air with constant clamor and appear to come from some spot immediately before we lord john hold up his hand as signal for we to stop and he make his way swiftly stoop and run to the line of rock we see he peep over they and give gesture of amazement then he stand stare as if forget we so utterly entrance be he by what he see finally he wave we to come on hold up his hand as signal for caution his whole bearing make i feel that something wonderful but dangerous lie before we creep to his side we look over the rock the place into which we gaze be pit and may in the early day have be one of the small volcanic blow hole of the plateau it be bowl shape and at the bottom some hundred of yard from where we lay be pool of green scum stagnant water fringe with bullrush it be weird place in itself but its occupant make it seem like scene from the seven circles of dante the place be rookery of pterodactyls there be hundred of they congregate within view all the bottom area round the water edge be alive with their young one and with hideous mother brood upon their leathery yellowish egg from this crawl flap mass of obscene reptilian life come the shocking clamor which fill the air and the mephitic horrible musty odor which turn we sick but above perch each upon its own stone tall gray and wither more like dead and dry specimen than actual living creature sit the horrible male absolutely motionless save for the rolling of their red eye or an occasional snap of their rat trap beak as dragon fly go past they their huge membranous wing be close by fold their fore arm so that they sit like gigantic old woman wrap in hideous web color shawl and with their ferocious head protrude above they large and small not less than thousand of these filthy creature lie in the hollow before we our professor would gladly have stay there all day so entrance be they by this opportunity of study the life of prehistoric age they point out the fish and dead bird lie about among the rock as prove the nature of the food of these creature and hear they congratulate each other on having clear up the point why the bone of this fly dragon be find in such great number in certain well define area as in the cambridge green sand since it be now see that like penguin they live in gregarious fashion finally however challenger bent upon prove some point which summerlee have contest thrust his head over the rock and nearly bring destruction upon we all in an instant the near male give shrill whistle cry and flap its twenty foot span of leathery wing as it soar up into the air the female and young one huddle together beside the water while the whole circle of sentinel rise one after the other and sail off into the sky it be wonderful sight to see at least hundred creature of such enormous size and hideous appearance all swoop like swallow with swift shear wing stroke above we but soon we realize that it be not one on which we could afford to linger at first the great brute fly round in huge ring as if to make sure what the exact extent of the danger might be then the flight grow low and the circle narrower until they be whiz round and round we the dry rustle flap of their huge slate color wing fill the air with volume of sound that make i think of hendon aerodrome upon race day "make for the wood and keep together cry lord john club his rifle the brute mean mischief "the moment we attempt to retreat the circle close in upon we until the tip of the wing of those near to we nearly touch our face we beat at they with the stock of our gun but there be nothing solid or vulnerable to strike then suddenly out of the whizzing slate color circle long neck shoot out and fierce beak make thrust at we another and another follow summerlee give cry and put his hand to his face from which the blood be stream feel prod at the back of my neck and turn dizzy with the shock challenger fall and as stoop to pick he up be again strike from behind and drop on the top of he at the same instant hear the crash of lord john 's elephant gun and look up see one of the creature with broken wing struggle upon the ground spit and gurgle at we with wide open beak and blood shoot goggle eye like some devil in medieval picture its comrade have fly high at the sudden sound and be circle above our head "now cry lord john now for our lives!"we stagger through the brushwood and even as we reach the tree the harpy be on we again summerlee be knock down but we tear he up and rush among the trunk once there we be safe for those huge wing have no space for their sweep beneath the branch as we limp homeward sadly maul and discomfited we see they for long time fly at great height against the deep blue sky above our head soar round and round no big than wood pigeon with their eye no doubt still follow our progress at last however as we reach the thick wood they give up the chase and we see they no more "a most interesting and convincing experience say challenger as we halt beside the brook and he bathe swollen knee we be exceptionally well informed summerlee as to the habit of the enraged pterodactyl "summerlee be wipe the blood from cut in his forehead while be tie up nasty stab in the muscle of the neck lord john have the shoulder of his coat tear away but the creature 's tooth have only graze the flesh "it be worth note challenger continue that our young friend have receive an undoubted stab while lord john 's coat could only have be tear by bite in my own case be beat about the head by their wing so we have have remarkable exhibition of their various method of offence ""it have be touch and go for our life say lord john gravely and could not think of more rotten sort of death than to be out by such filthy vermin be sorry to fire my rifle but by jove there be no great choice ""we should not be here if you have n't say with conviction "it may do no harm say he among these wood there must be many loud crack from splitting or fall tree which would be just like the sound of gun but now if you be of my opinion we have have thrill enough for one day and have good get back to the surgical box at the camp for some carbolic who know what venom these beast may have in their hideous jaws?"but surely no man ever have just such day since the world begin some fresh surprise be ever in store for we when follow the course of our brook we at last reach our glade and see the thorny barricade of our camp we think that our adventure be at an end but we have something more to think of before we could rest the gate of fort challenger have be untouched the wall be unbroken and yet it have be visit by some strange and powerful creature in our absence no foot mark show trace of its nature and only the overhang branch of the enormous ginko tree suggest how it might have come and go but of its malevolent strength there be ample evidence in the condition of our store they be strew at random all over the ground and one tin of meat have be crush into piece so as to extract the content case of cartridge have be shatter into matchwood and one of the brass shell lay shred into piece beside it again the feeling of vague horror come upon our soul and we gaze round with frightened eye at the dark shadow which lie around we in all of which some fearsome shape might be lurk how good it be when we be hail by the voice of zambo and go to the edge of the plateau see he sit grin at we upon the top of the opposite pinnacle "all well massa challenger all well he cry i stay here no fear you always find i when you want "his honest black face and the immense view before we which carry we half way back to the affluent of the amazon help we to remember that we really be upon this earth in the twentieth century and have not by some magic be convey to some raw planet in its early and wildest state how difficult it be to realize that the violet line upon the far horizon be well advanced to that great river upon which huge steamer run and folk talk of the small affair of life while we maroon among the creature of bygone age could but gaze towards it and yearn for all that it meant!one other memory remain with i of this wonderful day and with it will close this letter the two professor their temper aggravate no doubt by their injury have fall out as to whether our assailant be of the genus pterodactylus or dimorphodon and high word have ensue to avoid their wrangling move some little way apart and be seat smoke upon the trunk of fallen tree when lord john stroll over in my direction "i say malone say he do you remember that place where those beast were?""very clearly ""a sort of volcanic pit be it not?""exactly say i."did you notice the soil?""rock ""but round the water where the reed were?""it be bluish soil it look like clay ""exactly volcanic tube full of blue clay ""what of that ask "oh nothing nothing say he and stroll back to where the voice of the contend man of science rise in prolong duet the high strident note of summerlee rise and fall to the sonorous bass of challenger should have think no more of lord john 's remark be it not that once again that night hear he mutter to himself blue clay clay in volcanic tube they be the last word hear before drop into an exhausted sleep lord john roxton be right when he think that some specially toxic quality might lie in the bite of the horrible creature which have attack we on the morning after our first adventure upon the plateau both summerlee and be in great pain and fever while challenger 's knee be so bruised that he could hardly limp we keep to our camp all day therefore lord john busy himself with such help as we could give he in raise the height and thickness of the thorny wall which be our only defense remember that during the whole long day be haunt by the feeling that we be closely observe though by whom or whence could give no guess so strong be the impression that tell professor challenger of it who put it down to the cerebral excitement cause by my fever again and again glance round swiftly with the conviction that be about to see something but only to meet the dark tangle of our hedge or the solemn and cavernous gloom of the great tree which arch above our head and yet the feeling grow ever strong in my own mind that something observant and something malevolent be at our very elbow think of the indian superstition of the curupuri the dreadful lurk spirit of the wood and could have imagine that his terrible presence haunt those who have invade his most remote and sacred retreat that night our third in maple white land we have an experience which leave fearful impression upon our mind and make we thankful that lord john have work so hard in make our retreat impregnable we be all sleep round our die fire when we be arouse or rather should say shoot out of our slumber by succession of the most frightful cry and scream to which have ever listen know no sound to which could compare this amazing tumult which seem to come from some spot within few hundred yard of our camp it be as ear splitting as any whistle of railway engine but whereas the whistle be clear mechanical sharp edge sound this be far deep in volume and vibrant with the uttermost strain of agony and horror we clap our hand to our ear to shut out that nerve shake appeal cold sweat break out over my body and my heart turn sick at the misery of it all the woe of torture life all its stupendous indictment of high heaven its innumerable sorrow seem to be center and condense into that one dreadful agonize cry and then under this high pitch ring sound there be another more intermittent low deep cheste laugh growling throaty gurgle of merriment which form grotesque accompaniment to the shriek with which it be blend for three or four minute on end the fearsome duet continue while all the foliage rustle with the rise of startled bird then it shut off as suddenly as it begin for long time we sit in horrified silence then lord john throw bundle of twig upon the fire and their red glare light up the intent face of my companion and flicker over the great bough above our head "what be it whisper "we shall know in the morning say lord john it be close to we not far than the glade ""we have be privilege to overhear prehistoric tragedy the sort of drama which occur among the reed upon the border of some jurassic lagoon when the great dragon pin the less among the slime say challenger with more solemnity than have ever hear in his voice it be surely well for man that he come late in the order of creation there be power abroad in early day which no courage and no mechanism of his could have meet what could his sling his throwing stick or his arrow avail he against such force as have be loose to night even with modern rifle it would be all odd on the monster ""i think should back my little friend say lord john caress his express but the beast would certainly have good sporting chance "summerlee raise his hand "hush he cry surely hear something?"from the utter silence there emerge deep regular pat pat it be the tread of some animal the rhythm of soft but heavy pad place cautiously upon the ground it steal slowly round the camp and then halt near our gateway there be low sibilant rise and fall the breathing of the creature only our feeble hedge separate we from this horror of the night each of we have seize his rifle and lord john have pull out small bush to make an embrasure in the hedge "by george he whisper think can see it!"i stoop and peer over his shoulder through the gap yes could see it too in the deep shadow of the tree there be deep shadow yet black inchoate vague crouch form full of savage vigor and menace it be no high than horse but the dim outline suggest vast bulk and strength that hissing pant as regular and full volume as the exhaust of an engine speak of monstrous organism once as it move think see the glint of two terrible greenish eye there be an uneasy rustling as if it be crawl slowly forward "i believe it be go to spring say cock my rifle "don't fire do n't fire whisper lord john the crash of gun in this silent night would be hear for mile keep it as last card ""if it get over the hedge we be do say summerlee and his voice crackle into nervous laugh as he speak "no it must not get over cry lord john but hold your fire to the last perhaps can make something of the fellow 'll chance it anyhow "it be as brave an act as ever see man do he stoop to the fire pick up blazing branch and slip in an instant through sallyport which he have make in our gateway the thing move forward with dreadful snarl lord john never hesitate but run towards it with quick light step he dash the flame wood into the brute 's face for one moment have vision of horrible mask like giant toad 's of warty leprous skin and of loose mouth all beslobbere with fresh blood the next there be crash in the underwood and our dreadful visitor be go "i think he would n't face the fire say lord john laugh as he come back and throw his branch among the faggot "you should not have take such risk we all cry "there be nothin' else to be do if
