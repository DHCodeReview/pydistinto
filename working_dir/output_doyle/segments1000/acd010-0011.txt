name the lake say he you see it first and by george if you choose to put lake malone on it no one have well right ""by all mean let our young friend give it name say challenger "then say blush dare say as say it let it be name lake gladys ""don't you think the central lake would be more descriptive remark summerlee "i should prefer lake gladys "challenger look at i sympathetically and shake his great head in mock disapproval boy will be boy say he lake gladys let it be "i have say or perhaps have not say for my memory play i sad trick these day that glow with pride when three such man as my comrade thank i for having save or at least greatly help the situation as the youngster of the party not merely in year but in experience character knowledge and all that go to make man have be overshadow from the first and now be come into my own warm at the thought alas for the pride which go before fall that little glow of self satisfaction that add measure of self confidence be to lead i on that very night to the most dreadful experience of my life end with shock which turn my heart sick when think of it it come about in this way have be unduly excited by the adventure of the tree and sleep seem to be impossible summerlee be on guard sit hunch over our small fire quaint angular figure his rifle across his knee and his pointed goat like beard wag with each weary nod of his head lord john lie silent wrap in the south american poncho which he wear while challenger snore with roll and rattle which reverberate through the wood the full moon be shine brightly and the air be crisply cold what night for walk and then suddenly come the thought why not suppose steal softly away suppose make my way down to the central lake suppose be back at breakfast with some record of the place would not in that case be think an even more worthy associate then if summerlee carry the day and some mean of escape be find we should return to london with first hand knowledge of the central mystery of the plateau to which alone of all man would have penetrate think of gladys with she there be heroism all round we seem to hear her voice as she say it think also of mcardle what three column article for the paper what foundation for career correspondentship in the next great war might be within my reach clutch at gun my pocket be full of cartridge and part the thorn bush at the gate of our zareba quickly slip out my last glance show i the unconscious summerlee most futile of sentinel still nod away like queer mechanical toy in front of the smoulder fire have not go hundred yard before deeply repent my rashness may have say somewhere in this chronicle that be too imaginative to be really courageous man but that have an overpower fear of seem afraid this be the power which now carry i onwards simply could not slink back with nothing do even if my comrade should not have miss i and should never know of my weakness there would still remain some intolerable self shame in my own soul and yet shudder at the position in which find myself and would have give all possess at that moment to have be honorably free of the whole business it be dreadful in the forest the tree grow so thickly and their foliage spread so widely that could see nothing of the moon light save that here and there the high branch make tangled filigree against the starry sky as the eye become more used to the obscurity one learn that there be different degree of darkness among the tree that some be dimly visible while between and among they there be coal black shadow patch like the mouth of cave from which shrink in horror as pass think of the despairing yell of the torture iguanodon that dreadful cry which have echo through the wood think too of the glimpse have in the light of lord john 's torch of that bloated warty blood slaver muzzle even now be on its hunting ground at any instant it might spring upon i from the shadow this nameless and horrible monster stop and pick cartridge from my pocket open the breech of my gun as touch the lever my heart leap within i it be the shot gun not the rifle which have taken!again the impulse to return sweep over i here surely be most excellent reason for my failure one for which no one would think the less of i but again the foolish pride fight against that very word could not must not fail after all my rifle would probably have be as useless as shot gun against such danger as might meet if be to go back to camp to change my weapon could hardly expect to enter and to leave again without be see in that case there would be explanation and my attempt would no long be all my own after little hesitation then screw up my courage and continue upon my way my useless gun under my arm the darkness of the forest have be alarming but even bad be the white still flood of moonlight in the open glade of the iguanodon hid among the bush look out at it none of the great brute be in sight perhaps the tragedy which have befall one of they have drive they from their feeding ground in the misty silvery night could see no sign of any live thing take courage therefore slip rapidly across it and among the jungle on the farther side pick up once again the brook which be my guide it be cheery companion gurgle and chuckle as it run like the dear old trout stream in the west country where have fish at night in my boyhood so long as follow it down must come to the lake and so long as follow it back must come to the camp often have to lose sight of it on account of the tangled brush wood but be always within earshot of its tinkle and splash as one descend the slope the wood become thin and bush with occasional high tree take the place of the forest could make good progress therefore and could see without be see pass close to the pterodactyl swamp and as do so with dry crisp leathery rattle of wing one of these great creature it be twenty foot at least from tip to tip rise up from somewhere near i and soar into the air as it pass across the face of the moon the light shine clearly through the membranous wing and it look like fly skeleton against the white tropical radiance crouch low among the bush for know from past experience that with single cry the creature could bring hundred of its loathsome mate about my ear it be not until it have settle again that dare to steal onwards upon my journey the night have be exceedingly still but as advance become conscious of low rumble sound continuous murmur somewhere in front of i this grow louder as proceed until at last it be clearly quite close to i when stand still the sound be constant so that it seem to come from some stationary cause it be like boiling kettle or the bubbling of some great pot soon come upon the source of it for in the center of small clearing find lake or pool rather for it be not large than the basin of the trafalgar square fountain of some black pitch like stuff the surface of which rise and fall in great blister of burst gas the air above it be shimmer with heat and the ground round be so hot that could hardly bear to lay my hand on it it be clear that the great volcanic outburst which have raise this strange plateau so many year ago have not yet entirely spend its force blacken rock and mound of lava have already see everywhere peep out from amid the luxuriant vegetation which drape they but this asphalt pool in the jungle be the first sign that we have of actual exist activity on the slope of the ancient crater have no time to examine it far for have need to hurry if be to be back in camp in the morning it be fearsome walk and one which will be with i so long as memory hold in the great moonlight clearing slunk along among the shadow on the margin in the jungle creep forward stop with beat heart whenever hear as often do the crash of break branch as some wild beast go past now and then great shadow loom up for an instant and be go great silent shadow which seem to prowl upon padded foot how often stop with the intention of return and yet every time my pride conquer my fear and send i on again until my object should be attain at last my watch show that it be one in the morning see the gleam of water amid the opening of the jungle and ten minute later be among the reed upon the border of the central lake be exceedingly dry so lie down and take long draught of its water which be fresh and cold there be broad pathway with many track upon it at the spot which have find so that it be clearly one of the drinking place of the animal close to the water 's edge there be huge isolated block of lava up this climb and lie on the top have an excellent view in every direction the first thing which see fill i with amazement when describe the view from the summit of the great tree say that on the farther cliff could see number of dark spot which appear to be the mouth of cave now as look up at the same cliff see disc of light in every direction ruddy clearly define patch like the port hole of liner in the darkness for moment think it be the lava glow from some volcanic action but this could not be so any volcanic action would surely be down in the hollow and not high among the rock what then be the alternative it be wonderful and yet it must surely be these ruddy spot must be the reflection of fire within the cave fire which could only be light by the hand of man there be human being then upon the plateau how gloriously my expedition be justify here be news indeed for we to bear back with we to london!for long time lie and watch these red quiver blotch of light suppose they be ten mile off from i yet even at that distance one could observe how from time to time they twinkle or be obscure as someone pass before they what would not have give to be able to crawl up to they to peep in and to take back some word to my comrade as to the appearance and character of the race who live in so strange place it be out of the question for the moment and yet surely we could not leave the plateau until we have some definite knowledge upon the point lake gladys my own lake lie like sheet of quicksilver before i with reflected moon shine brightly in the center of it it be shallow for in many place see low sandbank protrude above the water everywhere upon the still surface could see sign of life sometimes mere ring and ripple in the water sometimes the gleam of great silver sided fish in the air sometimes the arched slate color back of some pass monster once upon yellow sandbank see creature like huge swan with clumsy body and high flexible neck shuffle about upon the margin presently it plunge in and for some time could see the arched neck and dart head undulate over the water then it dive and see it no more my attention be soon draw away from these distant sight and bring back to what be go on at my very foot two creature like large armadillo have come down to the drinking place and be squat at the edge of the water their long flexible tongue like red ribbon shoot in and out as they lap huge deer with branch horn magnificent creature which carry itself like king come down with its doe and two fawn and drank beside the armadillo no such deer exist anywhere else upon earth for the moose or elk which have see would hardly have reach its shoulder presently it give warning snort and be off with its family among the reed while the armadillo also scuttle for shelter new comer most monstrous animal be come down the path for moment wonder where could have see that ungainly shape that arch back with triangular fringe along it that strange bird like head hold close to the ground then it come back to i it be the stegosaurus the very creature which maple white have preserve in his sketch book and which have be the first object which arrest the attention of challenger there he be perhaps the very speciman which the american artist have encounter the ground shake beneath his tremendous weight and his gulping of water resound through the still night for five minute he be so close to my rock that by stretch out my hand could have touch the hideous wave hackle upon his back then he lumber away and be lose among the boulder look at my watch see that it be half past two o'clock and high time therefore that start upon my homeward journey there be no difficulty about the direction in which should return for all along have keep the little brook upon my left and it open into the central lake within stone's throw of the boulder upon which have be lie set off therefore in high spirit for feel that have do good work and be bring back fine budget of news for my companion foremost of all of course be the sight of the fiery cave and the certainty that some troglodytic race inhabit they but besides that could speak from experience of the central lake could testify that it be full of strange creature and have see several land form of primeval life which we have not before encounter reflect as walk that few man in the world could have spend stranger night or add more to human knowledge in the course of it be plod up the slope turn these thought over in my mind and have reach point which may have be half way to home when my mind be bring back to my own position by strange noise behind i it be something between snore and growl low deep and exceedingly menacing some strange creature be evidently near i but nothing could be see so hasten more rapidly upon my way have traverse half mile or so when suddenly the sound be repeat still behind i but louder and more menacing than before my heart stand still within i as it flash across i that the beast whatever it be must surely be after i my skin grow cold and my hair rise at the thought that these monster should tear each other to piece be part of the strange struggle for existence but that they should turn upon modern man that they should deliberately track and hunt down the predominant human be staggering and fearsome thought remember again the blood beslobbere face which we have see in the glare of lord john 's torch like some horrible vision from the deep circle of dante 's hell with my knee shake beneath i stand and glare with start eye down the moonlit path which lie behind i all be quiet as in dream landscape silver clearing and the black patch of the bush nothing else could see then from out of the silence imminent and threatening there come once more that low throaty croaking far louder and close than before there could no long be doubt something be on my trail and be close in upon i every minute stand like man paralyze still stare at the ground which have traverse then suddenly see it there be movement among the bush at the far end of the clearing which have just traverse great dark shadow disengage itself and hop out into the clear moonlight say hop advisedly for the beast move like kangaroo spring along in an erect position upon its powerful hind leg while its front one be hold bent in front of it it be of enormous size and power like an erect elephant but its movement in spite of its bulk be exceedingly alert for moment as see its shape hope that it be an iguanodon which know to be harmless but ignorant as be soon see that this be very different creature instead of the gentle deer shape head of the great three toe leaf eater this beast have broad squat toad like face like that which have alarm we in our camp his ferocious cry and the horrible energy of his pursuit both assure i that this be surely one of the great flesh eat dinosaur the most terrible beast which have ever walk this earth as the huge brute lope along it drop forward upon its fore paw and bring its nose to the ground every twenty yard or so it be smell out my trail sometimes for an instant it be at fault then it would catch it up again and come bound swiftly along the path have take even now when think of that nightmare the sweat break out upon my brow what could do my useless fowling piece be in my hand what help could get from that look desperately round for some rock or tree but be in bushy jungle with nothing high than sapling within sight while know that the creature behind i could tear down an ordinary tree as though it be reed my only possible chance lie in flight could not move swiftly over the rough broken ground but as looked round i in despair see well mark hard beat path which run across in front of i we have see several of the sort the run of various wild beast during our expedition along this could perhaps hold my own for be fast runner and in excellent condition fling away my useless gun set myself to do such half mile as have never do before or since my limb ache my chest heave feel that my throat would burst for want of air and yet with that horror behind i run and run and run at last pause hardly able to move for moment think that have throw he off the path lie still behind i and then suddenly with crashing and rending thudding of giant foot and panting of monster lung the beast be upon i once more he be at my very heel be lose madman that be to linger so long before flee up to then he have hunt by scent and his movement be slow but he have actually see i as start to run from then onwards he have hunt by sight for the path show he where have go now as he come round the curve he be spring in great bound the moonlight shine upon his huge projecting eye the row of enormous tooth in his open mouth and the gleam fringe of claws upon his short powerful forearm with scream of terror turn and rush wildly down the path behind i the thick gasp breathing of the creature sound louder and louder his heavy footfall be beside i every instant expect to feel his grip upon my back and then suddenly there come crash be fall through space and everything beyond be darkness and rest as emerge from my unconsciousness which could not think have last more than few minute be aware of most dreadful and penetrate smell put out my hand in the darkness come upon something which feel like huge lump of meat while my other hand close upon large bone up above i there be circle of starlit sky which show i that be lie at the bottom of deep pit slowly stagger to my foot and feel myself all over be stiff and sore from head to foot but there be no limb which would not move no joint which would not bend as the circumstance of my fall come back into my confused brain look up in terror expect to see that dreadful head silhouette against the pale sky there be no sign of the monster however nor could hear any sound from above begin to walk slowly round therefore feel in every direction to find out what this strange place could be into which have be so opportunely precipitate it be as have say pit with sharply slope wall and level bottom about twenty foot across this bottom be litter with great gobbet of flesh most of which be in the last state of putridity the atmosphere be poisonous and horrible after trip and stumble over these lump of decay come suddenly against something hard and find that an upright post be firmly fix in the center of the hollow it be so high that could not reach the top of it with my hand and it appear to be cover with grease suddenly remember that have tin box of wax vestas in my pocket strike one of they be able at last to form some opinion of this place into which have fall there could be no question as to its nature it be trap make by the hand of man the post in the center some nine foot long be sharpen at the upper end and be black with the stale blood of the creature who have be impale upon it the remain scatter about be fragment of the victim which have be cut away in order to clear the stake for the next who might blunder in remember that challenger have declare that man could not exist upon the plateau since with his feeble weapon he could not hold his own against the monster who roam over it but now it be clear enough how it could be do in their narrow mouthed cave the native whoever they might be have refuge into which the huge saurian could not penetrate while with their develop brain they be capable of set such trap cover with branch across the path which mark the run of the animal as would destroy they in spite of all their strength and activity man be always the master the slope wall of the pit be not difficult for an active man to climb but hesitate long before trust myself within reach of the dreadful creature which have so nearly destroy i how do know that he be not lurk in the near clump of bush wait for my reappearance take heart however as recall conversation between challenger and summerlee upon the habit of the great saurian both be agree that the monster be practically brainless that there be no room for reason in their tiny cranial cavity and that if they have disappear from the rest of the world it be assuredly on account of their own stupidity which make it impossible for they to adapt themselves to change condition to lie in wait for i now would mean that the creature have appreciate what have happen to i and this in turn would argue some power connect cause and effect surely it be more likely that brainless creature act solely by vague predatory instinct would give up the chase when disappear and after pause of astonishment would wander away in search of some other prey clamber to the edge of the pit and look over the star be fade the sky be whiten and the cold wind of morning blow pleasantly upon my face could see or hear nothing of my enemy slowly climb out and
