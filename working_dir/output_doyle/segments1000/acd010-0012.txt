sit for while upon the ground ready to spring back into my refuge if any danger should appear then reassure by the absolute stillness and by the grow light take my courage in both hand and steal back along the path which have come some distance down it pick up my gun and shortly afterwards strike the brook which be my guide so with many frightened backward glance make for home and suddenly there come something to remind i of my absent companion in the clear still morning air there sound far away the sharp hard note of single rifle shoot pause and listen but there be nothing more for moment be shock at the thought that some sudden danger might have befall they but then simple and more natural explanation come to my mind it be now broad daylight no doubt my absence have be notice they have imagine that be lose in the wood and have fire this shot to guide i home it be true that we have make strict resolution against firing but if it seem to they that might be in danger they would not hesitate it be for i now to hurry on as fast as possible and so to reassure they be weary and spend so my progress be not so fast as wish but at last come into region which know there be the swamp of the pterodactyls upon my left there in front of i be the glade of the iguanodon now be in the last belt of tree which separate i from fort challenger raise my voice in cheery shout to allay their fear no answer greeting come back to i my heart sink at that ominous stillness quicken my pace into run the zareba rise before i even as have leave it but the gate be open rush in in the cold morning light it be fearful sight which meet my eye our effect be scatter in wild confusion over the ground my comrade have disappear and close to the smoulder ashe of our fire the grass be stain crimson with hideous pool of blood be so stunned by this sudden shock that for time must have nearly lose my reason have vague recollection as one remember bad dream of rush about through the wood all round the empty camp call wildly for my companion no answer come back from the silent shadow the horrible thought that might never see they again that might find myself abandon all alone in that dreadful place with no possible way of descend into the world below that might live and die in that nightmare country drive i to desperation could have tear my hair and beat my head in my despair only now do realize how have learn to lean upon my companion upon the serene self confidence of challenger and upon the masterful humorous coolness of lord john roxton without they be like child in the dark helpless and powerless do not know which way to turn or what should do first after period during which sit in bewilderment set myself to try and discover what sudden misfortune could have befall my companion the whole disorder appearance of the camp show that there have be some sort of attack and the rifle shoot no doubt mark the time when it have occur that there should have be only one shot show that it have be all over in an instant the rifle still lie upon the ground and one of they lord john 's have the empty cartridge in the breech the blanket of challenger and of summerlee beside the fire suggest that they have be asleep at the time the case of ammunition and of food be scatter about in wild litter together with our unfortunate camera and plate carrier but none of they be miss on the other hand all the expose provision and remember that there be considerable quantity of they be go they be animal then and not native who have make the inroad for surely the latter would have leave nothing behind but if animal or some single terrible animal then what have become of my comrade ferocious beast would surely have destroy they and leave their remain it be true that there be that one hideous pool of blood which tell of violence such monster as have pursue i during the night could have carry away victim as easily as cat would mouse in that case the other would have follow in pursuit but then they would assuredly have take their rifle with they the more try to think it out with my confused and weary brain the less could find any plausible explanation search round in the forest but could see no track which could help i to conclusion once lose myself and it be only by good luck and after an hour of wandering that find the camp once more suddenly thought come to i and bring some little comfort to my heart be not absolutely alone in the world down at the bottom of the cliff and within call of i be wait the faithful zambo go to the edge of the plateau and look over sure enough he be squat among his blanket beside his fire in his little camp but to my amazement second man be seat in front of he for an instant my heart leap for joy as think that one of my comrade have make his way safely down but second glance dispel the hope the rise sun shine red upon the man 's skin he be an indian shout loudly and wave my handkerchief presently zambo look up wave his hand and turn to ascend the pinnacle in short time he be stand close to i and listen with deep distress to the story which tell he "devil get they for sure massa malone say he you get into the devil 's country sah and he take you all to himself you take advice massa malone and come down quick else he get you as well ""how can come down zambo?""you get creeper from tree massa malone throw they over here make fast to this stump and so you have bridge ""we have think of that there be no creeper here which could bear we ""send for rope massa malone ""who can send and where?""send to indian village sah plenty hide rope in indian village indian down below send he ""who be he?"one of our indians other one beat he and take away his pay he come back to we ready now to take letter bring rope anything "to take letter why not perhaps he might bring help but in any case he would ensure that our life be not spend for nothing and that news of all that we have win for science should reach our friend at home have two complete letter already wait would spend the day in write third which would bring my experience absolutely up to date the indian could bear this back to the world order zambo therefore to come again in the evening and spend my miserable and lonely day in record my own adventure of the night before also draw up note to be give to any white merchant or captain of steam boat whom the indian could find implore they to see that rope be send to we since our life must depend upon it these document throw to zambo in the evening and also my purse which contain three english sovereign these be to be give to the indian and he be promise twice as much if he return with the rope so now you will understand my dear mr. mcardle how this communication reach you and you will also know the truth in case you never hear again from your unfortunate correspondent to night be too weary and too depressed to make my plan to morrow must think out some way by which shall keep in touch with this camp and yet search round for any trace of my unhappy friend just as the sun be set upon that melancholy night see the lonely figure of the indian upon the vast plain beneath i and watch he our one faint hope of salvation until he disappear in the rise mist of evening which lie rise tint from the set sun between the far off river and i it be quite dark when at last turn back to our stricken camp and my last vision as go be the red gleam of zambo 's fire the one point of light in the wide world below as be his faithful presence in my own shadow soul and yet feel happy than have do since this crush blow have fall upon i for it be good to think that the world should know what we have do so that at the bad our name should not perish with our body but should go down to posterity associate with the result of our labor it be an awesome thing to sleep in that ill fate camp and yet it be even more unnerving to do so in the jungle one or the other it must be prudence on the one hand warn i that should remain on guard but exhaust nature on the other declare that should do nothing of the kind climb up on to limb of the great gingko tree but there be no secure perch on its rounded surface and should certainly have fall off and break my neck the moment begin to doze get down therefore and ponder over what should do finally close the door of the zareba light three separate fire in triangle and having eat hearty supper drop off into profound sleep from which have strange and most welcome awakening in the early morning just as day be break hand be lay upon my arm and start up with all my nerve in tingle and my hand feel for rifle give cry of joy as in the cold gray light see lord john roxton kneel beside i it be he and yet it be not he have leave he calm in his bearing correct in his person prim in his dress now he be pale and wild eyed gasp as he breathe like one who have run far and fast his gaunt face be scratch and bloody his clothe be hang in rag and his hat be go stare in amazement but he give i no chance for question he be grab at our store all the time he speak "quick young fellah quick he cry every moment count get the rifle both of they have the other two now all the cartridge you can gather fill up your pocket now some food half dozen tin will do that be all right do n't wait to talk or think get move on or we be done!"still half awake and unable to imagine what it all might mean find myself hurry madly after he through the wood rifle under each arm and pile of various store in my hand he dodge in and out through the thickest of the scrub until he come to dense clump of brush wood into this he rush regardless of thorn and throw himself into the heart of it pull i down by his side "there he pant think we be safe here they 'll make for the camp as sure as fate it will be their first idea but this should puzzle 'em ""what be it all ask when have get my breath where be the professor and who be it that be after us?""the ape man he cry my god what brute do n't raise your voice for they have long ear sharp eye too but no power of scent so far as could judge so do n't think they can sniff we out where have you be young fellah you be well out of it "in few sentence whisper what have do "pretty bad say he when he have hear of the dinosaur and the pit it be n't quite the place for rest cure what but have no idea what its possibility be until those devil get hold of we the man eatin papuans have i once but they be chesterfields compare to this crowd ""how do it happen ask "it be in the early mornin our learn friend be just stirrin had n't even begin to argue yet suddenly it rain ape they come down as thick as apple out of tree they have be assemblin in the dark suppose until that great tree over our head be heavy with they shoot one of they through the belly but before we know where we be they have we spread eagle on our back call they ape but they carry stick and stone in their hand and jabber talk to each other and end up by tyin our hand with creeper so they be ahead of any beast that have see in my wanderin 's ape man that be what they be missin link and wish they have stay missin they carry off their wound comrade he be bleedin like pig and then they sit around we and if ever see frozen murder it be in their face they be big fellow as big as man and deal strong curious glassy gray eye they have under red tuft and they just sit and gloat and gloat challenger be no chicken but even he be cow he manage to struggle to his foot and yell out at they to have do with it and get it over think he have go bit off his head at the suddenness of it for he rage and curse at they like lunatic if they have be row of his favorite pressmen he could not have slang they bad ""well what do they do be enthral by the strange story which my companion be whisper into my ear while all the time his keen eye be shoot in every direction and his hand grasp his cocked rifle "i think it be the end of we but instead of that it start they on new line they all jabber and chatter together then one of they stand out beside challenger you 'll smile young fellah but pon my word they might have be kinsman could n't have believe it if have n't see it with my own eye this old ape man he be their chief be sort of red challenger with every one of our friend 's beauty point only just trifle more so he have the short body the big shoulder the round chest no neck great ruddy frill of beard the tufte eyebrow the what do you want damn you look about the eye and the whole catalogue when the ape man stand by challenger and put his paw on his shoulder the thing be complete summerlee be bit hysterical and he laugh till he cry the ape man laugh too or at least they put up the devil of cacklin and they set to work to drag we off through the forest they would n't touch the gun and thing think they dangerous expect but they carry away all our loose food summerlee and get some rough handlin on the way there be my skin and my clothe to prove it for they take we bee line through the bramble and their own hide be like leather but challenger be all right four of they carry he shoulder high and he go like roman emperor what be that?"it be strange clicking noise in the distance not unlike castanet "there they go say my companion slip cartridge into the second double barrelled express load they all up young fellah my lad for we be not go to be take alive and do n't you think it that be the row they make when they be excited by george they 'll have something to excite they if they put we up the last stand of the grays wo n't be in it with their rifle grasp in their stiffen hand mid ring of the dead and dyin as some fathead sing can you hear they now?""very far away ""that little lot will do no good but expect their search party be all over the wood well be tell you my tale of woe they get we soon to this town of theirs about thousand hut of branch and leave in great grove of tree near the edge of the cliff it be three or four mile from here the filthy beast finger i all over and feel as if should never be clean again they tie we up the fellow who handle i could tie like bosun and there we lie with our toe up beneath tree while great brute stand guard over we with club in his hand when say we mean summerlee and myself old challenger be up tree eatin pine and havin' the time of his life be bind to say that he manage to get some fruit to we and with his own hand he loosen our bond if you have see he sit up in that tree hob nobbin with his twin brother and singin in that rollin bass of his ring out wild bell cause music of any kind seem to put 'em in good humor you 'd have smile but we be n't in much mood for laughin as you can guess they be incline within limit to let he do what he like but they draw the line pretty sharply at we it be mighty consolation to we all to know that you be runnin loose and have the archive in your keepin' "well now young fellah 'll tell you what will surprise you you say you see sign of man and fire trap and the like well we have see the native themselves poor devil they be down face little chap and have enough to make they so it seem that the human hold one side of this plateau over yonder where you see the cave and the ape man hold this side and there be bloody war between they all the time that be the situation so far as could follow it well yesterday the ape man get hold of dozen of the human and bring they in as prisoner you never hear such jabberin and shriekin in your life the man be little red fellow and have be bite and claw so that they could hardly walk the ape man put two of they to death there and then fairly pull the arm off one of they it be perfectly beastly plucky little chap they be and hardly give squeak but it turn we absolutely sick summerlee faint and even challenger have as much as he could stand think they have clear do n't you?"we listen intently but nothing save the calling of the bird break the deep peace of the forest lord roxton go on with his story "i think you have have the escape of your life young fellah my lad it be catchin those indians that put you clean out of their head else they would have be back to the camp for you as sure as fate and gather you in of course as you say they have be watchin we from the beginnin out of that tree and they know perfectly well that we be one short however they could think only of this new haul so it be and not bunch of ape that drop in on you in the morning well we have horrid business afterwards my god what nightmare the whole thing be you remember the great bristle of sharp cane down below where we find the skeleton of the american well that be just under ape town and that be the jumpin'-off place of their prisoner expect there 's heap of skeleton there if we look for 'em they have sort of clear parade ground on the top and they make proper ceremony about it one by one the poor devil have to jump and the game be to see whether they be merely dash to piece or whether they get skewered on the cane they take we out to see it and the whole tribe line up on the edge four of the indians jump and the cane go through 'em like knittin needle through pat of butter no wonder we find that poor yankee 's skeleton with the cane growin between his rib it be horrible but it be doocedly interestin too we be all fascinated to see they take the dive even when we think it would be our turn next on the spring board "well it be n't they keep six of the indians up for to day that be how understand it but fancy we be to be the star performer in the show challenger might get off but summerlee and be in the bill their language be more than half sign and it be not hard to follow they so think it be time we make break for it have be plottin it out bit and have one or two thing clear in my mind it be all on i for summerlee be useless and challenger not much well the only time they get together they get slangin because they could n't agree upon the scientific classification of these red head devil that have get hold of we one say it be the dryopithecus of java the other say it be pithecanthropus madness call it loonie both but as say have think out one or two point that be helpful one be that these brute could not run as fast as man in the open they have short bandy leg you see and heavy body even challenger could give few yard in hundred to the good of they and you or would be perfect shrubb another point be that they know nothin' about gun do n't believe they ever understand how the fellow shoot come by his hurt if we could get at our gun there be no sayin what we could do "so break away early this mornin give my guard kick in the tummy that lay he out and sprint for the camp there get you and the gun and here we be ""but the professor cry in consternation "well we must just go back and fetch 'em could n't bring 'em with i challenger be up the tree and summerlee be not fit for the effort the only chance be to get the gun and try rescue of course they may scupper they at once in revenge do n't think they would touch challenger but would n't answer for summerlee but they would have have he in any case of that be certain so have n't make matter any bad by boltin but we be honor bind to go back and have they out or see it through with they so you can make up your soul young fellah my lad for it will be one way or the other before evenin' "i have try to imitate here lord roxton 's jerky talk his short strong sentence the half humorous half reckless tone that run through it all but he be bear leader as danger thicken his jaunty manner would increase his speech become more racy his cold eye glitter into ardent life and his don quixote moustache bristle with joyous excitement his love of danger his intense appreciation of the drama of an adventure all the more intense for be hold tightly in his consistent view that every peril in life be form of sport fierce game betwixt you and fate with death as forfeit make he wonderful companion at such hour if it be not for our fear as to the fate of our companion it would have be positive joy to throw myself with such man into such an affair we be rise from our brushwood hiding place when suddenly feel his grip upon my arm "by george he whisper here they come!"from where we lay we could look down brown aisle arch with green form by the trunk and branch along this party of the ape man be pass they go in single file
