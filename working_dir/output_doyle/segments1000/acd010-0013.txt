with bent leg and rounded back their hand occasionally touch the ground their head turn to left and right as they trot along their crouch gait take away from their height but should put they at five foot or so with long arm and enormous chest many of they carry stick and at the distance they look like line of very hairy and deform human being for moment catch this clear glimpse of they then they be lose among the bush "not this time say lord john who have catch up his rifle our good chance be to lie quiet until they have give up the search then we shall see whether we ca n't get back to their town and hit 'em where it hurt most give 'em an hour and we 'll march "we fill in the time by open one of our food tin and make sure of our breakfast lord roxton have have nothing but some fruit since the morning before and eat like starve man then at last our pocket bulge with cartridge and rifle in each hand we start off upon our mission of rescue before leave it we carefully mark our little hiding place among the brush wood and its bearing to fort challenger that we might find it again if we need it we slunk through the bush in silence until we come to the very edge of the cliff close to the old camp there we halt and lord john give i some idea of his plan "so long as we be among the thick tree these swine be our master say he they can see we and we can not see they but in the open it be different there we can move fast than they so we must stick to the open all we can the edge of the plateau have few large tree than far inland so that be our line of advance go slowly keep your eye open and your rifle ready above all never let they get you prisoner while there be cartridge leave that be my last word to you young fellah "when we reach the edge of the cliff look over and see our good old black zambo sitting smoke on rock below we would have give great deal to have hail he and tell he how we be place but it be too dangerous lest we should be hear the wood seem to be full of the ape man again and again we hear their curious click chatter at such time we plunge into the near clump of bush and lie still until the sound have pass away our advance therefore be very slow and two hour at least must have pass before see by lord john 's cautious movement that we must be close to our destination he motion to i to lie still and he crawl forward himself in minute he be back again his face quiver with eagerness "come say he come quick hope to the lord we be not too late already!"i find myself shake with nervous excitement as scramble forward and lie down beside he look out through the bush at clearing which stretch before we it be sight which shall never forget until my die day so weird so impossible that do not know how be to make you realize it or how in few year shall bring myself to believe in it if live to sit once more on lounge in the savage club and look out on the drab solidity of the embankment know that it will seem then to be some wild nightmare some delirium of fever yet will set it down now while it be still fresh in my memory and one at least the man who lie in the damp grass by my side will know if have lie wide open space lie before we some hundred of yard across all green turf and low bracken grow to the very edge of the cliff round this clearing there be semi circle of tree with curious hut build of foliage pile one above the other among the branch rookery with every nest little house would well convey the idea the opening of these hut and the branch of the tree be throng with dense mob of ape people whom from their size take to be the female and infant of the tribe they form the background of the picture and be all look out with eager interest at the same scene which fascinate and bewilder we in the open and near the edge of the cliff there have assemble crowd of some hundred of these shaggy red haired creature many of they of immense size and all of they horrible to look upon there be certain discipline among they for none of they attempt to break the line which have be form in front there stand small group of indians little clean limbed red fellow whose skin glow like polished bronze in the strong sunlight tall thin white man be stand beside they his head bow his arm fold his whole attitude expressive of his horror and dejection there be no mistake the angular form of professor summerlee in front of and around this deject group of prisoner be several ape man who watch they closely and make all escape impossible then right out from all the other and close to the edge of the cliff be two figure so strange and under other circumstance so ludicrous that they absorb my attention the one be our comrade professor challenger the remain of his coat still hang in strip from his shoulder but his shirt have be all tear out and his great beard merge itself in the black tangle which cover his mighty chest he have lose his hat and his hair which have grow long in our wandering be fly in wild disorder single day seem to have change he from the high product of modern civilization to the most desperate savage in south america beside he stand his master the king of the ape man in all thing he be as lord john have say the very image of our professor save that his coloring be red instead of black the same short broad figure the same heavy shoulder the same forward hang of the arm the same bristle beard merge itself in the hairy chest only above the eyebrow where the slope forehead and low curved skull of the ape man be in sharp contrast to the broad brow and magnificent cranium of the european could one see any marked difference at every other point the king be an absurd parody of the professor all this which take i so long to describe impress itself upon i in few second then we have very different thing to think of for an active drama be in progress two of the ape man have seize one of the indians out of the group and drag he forward to the edge of the cliff the king raise his hand as signal they catch the man by his leg and arm and swing he three time backwards and forwards with tremendous violence then with frightful heave they shoot the poor wretch over the precipice with such force do they throw he that he curve high in the air before begin to drop as he vanish from sight the whole assembly except the guard rush forward to the edge of the precipice and there be long pause of absolute silence break by mad yell of delight they spring about toss their long hairy arm in the air and howl with exultation then they fall back from the edge form themselves again into line and wait for the next victim this time it be summerlee two of his guard catch he by the wrist and pull he brutally to the front his thin figure and long limb struggle and flutter like chicken be drag from coop challenger have turn to the king and wave his hand frantically before he he be beg plead implore for his comrade 's life the ape man push he roughly aside and shake his head it be the last conscious movement he be to make upon earth lord john 's rifle crack and the king sink down tangled red sprawl thing upon the ground "shoot into the thick of they shoot sonny shoot cry my companion there be strange red depth in the soul of the most commonplace man be tenderhearte by nature and have find my eye moist many time over the scream of wound hare yet the blood lust be on i now find myself on my foot empty one magazine then the other click open the breech to re load snap it to again while cheer and yell with pure ferocity and joy of slaughter as do so with our four gun the two of we make horrible havoc both the guard who hold summerlee be down and he be staggering about like drunken man in his amazement unable to realize that he be free man the dense mob of ape man run about in bewilderment marvel whence this storm of death be come or what it might mean they wave gesticulate scream and trip up over those who have fall then with sudden impulse they all rush in howl crowd to the tree for shelter leave the ground behind they spot with their stricken comrade the prisoner be leave for the moment stand alone in the middle of the clearing challenger 's quick brain have grasp the situation he seize the bewildered summerlee by the arm and they both run towards we two of their guard bound after they and fall to two bullet from lord john we run forward into the open to meet our friend and press loaded rifle into the hand of each but summerlee be at the end of his strength he could hardly totter already the ape man be recover from their panic they be come through the brushwood and threaten to cut we off challenger and run summerlee along one at each of his elbow while lord john cover our retreat fire again and again as savage head snarl at we out of the bush for mile or more the chatter brute be at our very heel then the pursuit slacken for they learn our power and would no long face that unerre rifle when we have at last reach the camp we look back and find ourselves alone so it seem to we and yet we be mistaken we have hardly close the thornbush door of our zareba clasp each other 's hand and throw ourselves pant upon the ground beside our spring when we hear patter of foot and then gentle plaintive crying from outside our entrance lord roxton rush forward rifle in hand and throw it open there prostrate upon their face lie the little red figure of the four survive indians tremble with fear of we and yet implore our protection with an expressive sweep of his hand one of they point to the wood around they and indicate that they be full of danger then dart forward he throw his arm round lord john 's leg and rest his face upon they "by george cry our peer pull at his moustache in great perplexity say what the deuce be we to do with these people get up little chappie and take your face off my boot "summerlee be sit up and stuff some tobacco into his old briar "we've get to see they safe say he you 've pull we all out of the jaw of death my word it be good bit of work!""admirable cry challenger admirable not only we as individual but european science collectively owe you deep debt of gratitude for what you have do do not hesitate to say that the disappearance of professor summerlee and myself would have leave an appreciable gap in modern zoological history our young friend here and you have do most excellently well "he beam at we with the old paternal smile but european science would have be somewhat amazed could they have see their choose child the hope of the future with his tangled unkempt head his bare chest and his tattered clothe he have one of the meat tin between his knee and sit with large piece of cold australian mutton between his finger the indian look up at he and then with little yelp cringe to the ground and clung to lord john 's leg "don't you be scared my bonnie boy say lord john pat the matted head in front of he he ca n't stick your appearance challenger and by george do n't wonder all right little chap he be only human just the same as the rest of we ""really sir cry the professor "well it be lucky for you challenger that you be little out of the ordinary if you have n't be so like the king upon my word lord john you allow yourself great latitude ""well it be fact ""i beg sir that you will change the subject your remark be irrelevant and unintelligible the question before we be what be we to do with these indians the obvious thing be to escort they home if we know where their home be ""there be no difficulty about that say i. they live in the cave on the other side of the central lake ""our young friend here know where they live gather that it be some distance ""a good twenty mile say i.summerlee give groan "i for one could never get there surely hear those brute still howl upon our track "as he speak from the dark recess of the wood we hear far away the jabbering cry of the ape man the indians once more set up feeble wail of fear "we must move and move quick say lord john you help summerlee young fellah these indians will carry store now then come along before they can see we "in less than half an hour we have reach our brushwood retreat and conceal ourselves all day we hear the excited calling of the ape man in the direction of our old camp but none of they come our way and the tired fugitive red and white have long deep sleep be doze myself in the evening when someone pluck my sleeve and find challenger kneel beside i "you keep diary of these event and you expect eventually to publish it mr. malone say he with solemnity "i be only here as press reporter answer "exactly you may have hear some rather fatuous remark of lord john roxton 's which seem to imply that there be some some resemblance yes hear they ""i need not say that any publicity give to such an idea any levity in your narrative of what occur would be exceedingly offensive to i ""i will keep well within the truth ""lord john 's observation be frequently exceedingly fanciful and he be capable of attribute the most absurd reason to the respect which be always show by the most undeveloped race to dignity and character you follow my meaning?""entirely ""i leave the matter to your discretion then after long pause he add the king of the ape man be really creature of great distinction most remarkably handsome and intelligent personality do it not strike you?""a most remarkable creature say i.and the professor much ease in his mind settle down to his slumber once more we have imagine that our pursuer the ape man know nothing of our brush wood hiding place but we be soon to find out our mistake there be no sound in the wood not leaf move upon the tree and all be peace around we but we should have be warn by our first experience how cunningly and how patiently these creature can watch and wait until their chance come whatever fate may be mine through life be very sure that shall never be near death than be that morning but will tell you the thing in its due order we all awake exhausted after the terrific emotion and scanty food of yesterday summerlee be still so weak that it be an effort for he to stand but the old man be full of sort of surly courage which would never admit defeat council be hold and it be agree that we should wait quietly for an hour or two where we be have our much need breakfast and then make our way across the plateau and round the central lake to the cave where my observation have show that the indians live we rely upon the fact that we could count upon the good word of those whom we have rescue to ensure warm welcome from their fellow then with our mission accomplish and possess full knowledge of the secret of maple white land we should turn our whole thought to the vital problem of our escape and return even challenger be ready to admit that we should then have do all for which we have come and that our first duty from that time onwards be to carry back to civilization the amazing discovery we have make we be able now to take more leisurely view of the indians whom we have rescue they be small man wiry active and well build with lank black hair tie up in bunch behind their head with leathern thong and leathern also be their loin clothe their face be hairless well formed and good humored the lobe of their ear hang ragged and bloody show that they have be pierce for some ornament which their captor have tear out their speech though unintelligible to we be fluent among themselves and as they point to each other and utter the word accala many time over we gather that this be the name of the nation occasionally with face which be convulse with fear and hatred they shake their clenched hand at the wood round and cry doda doda which be surely their term for their enemy "what do you make of they challenger ask lord john one thing be very clear to i and that be that the little chap with the front of his head shave be chief among they "it be indeed evident that this man stand apart from the other and that they never venture to address he without every sign of deep respect he seem to be the young of they all and yet so proud and high be his spirit that upon challenger lay his great hand upon his head he start like spurred horse and with quick flash of his dark eye move far away from the professor then place his hand upon his breast and hold himself with great dignity he utter the word maretas several time the professor unabashe seize the near indian by the shoulder and proceed to lecture upon he as if he be potted speciman in class room "the type of these people say he in his sonorous fashion whether judge by cranial capacity facial angle or any other test can not be regard as low one on the contrary we must place it as considerably high in the scale than many south american tribe which can mention on no possible supposition can we explain the evolution of such race in this place for that matter so great gap separate these ape man from the primitive animal which have survive upon this plateau that it be inadmissible to think that they could have develop where we find they ""then where the dooce do they drop from ask lord john "a question which will no doubt be eagerly discuss in every scientific society in europe and america the professor answer my own reading of the situation for what it be worth he inflate his chest enormously and look insolently around he at the word be that evolution have advance under the peculiar condition of this country up to the vertebrate stage the old type survive and live on in company with the new one thus we find such modern creature as the tapir an animal with quite respectable length of pedigree the great deer and the ant eater in the companionship of reptilian form of jurassic type so much be clear and now come the ape man and the indian what be the scientific mind to think of their presence can only account for it by an invasion from outside it be probable that there exist an anthropoid ape in south america who in past age find his way to this place and that he develop into the creature we have see some of which here he look hard at i be of an appearance and shape which if it have be accompany by correspond intelligence would do not hesitate to say have reflect credit upon any live race as to the indians can not doubt that they be more recent immigrant from below under the stress of famine or of conquest they have make their way up here face by ferocious creature which they have never before see they take refuge in the cave which our young friend have describe but they have no doubt have bitter fight to hold their own against wild beast and especially against the ape man who would regard they as intruder and wage merciless war upon they with cunning which the large beast would lack hence the fact that their number appear to be limit well gentleman have read you the riddle aright or be there any point which you would query?"professor summerlee for once be too depressed to argue though he shake his head violently as token of general disagreement lord john merely scratch his scanty lock with the remark that he could n't put up fight as he be n't in the same weight or class for my own part perform my usual role of bring thing down to strictly prosaic and practical level by the remark that one of the indians be missing "he have go to fetch some water say lord roxton we fit he up with an empty beef tin and he be off ""to the old camp ask "no to the brook it be among the tree there it ca n't be more than couple of hundred yard but the beggar be certainly take his time ""i'll go and look after he say i. pick up my rifle and stroll in the direction of the brook leave my friend to lay out the scanty breakfast it may seem to you rash that even for so short distance should quit the shelter of our friendly thicket but you will remember that we be many mile from ape town that so far as we know the creature have not discover our retreat and that in any case with rifle in my hand have no fear of they have not yet learn their cunning or their strength could hear the murmur of our brook somewhere ahead of i but there be tangle of tree and brushwood between i and it be make my way through this at point which be just out of sight of my companion when under one of the tree notice something red huddle among the bush as approach it be shocked to see that it be the dead body of the miss indian he lie upon his side his limb draw up and his head screw round at most unnatural angle so that he seem to be look straight over his own shoulder give cry to warn my friend that something be amiss and run forwards stoop over the body surely my guardian angel be very near i then for some instinct of fear or it may have be some faint rustle of leave make i glance upwards out of the thick green foliage which hang low over my head two long muscular arm cover with reddish hair be slowly descend another instant and the great stealthy hand would have be round my throat spring backwards but quick as be those hand be quick still through my sudden spring they miss fatal grip but one of they catch the back of my neck and the other one my face throw my hand up to protect my throat and the next moment the huge paw have slide down my face and close over they be lift lightly from the ground and feel an intolerable pressure force my head back and back until the strain upon the cervical spine be more than could bear my sense swam but still tear at the hand and force it out from my chin look up see frightful face with cold inexorable light blue eye look down into mine there be something hypnotic in those terrible eye could struggle no long as the creature feel i grow limp in his grasp two white canine gleam for moment at each side of the vile mouth and the grip tighten still more upon my chin force it always upwards
