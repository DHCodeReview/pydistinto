and back thin oval tint mist form before my eye and little silvery bell tinkle in my ear dully and far off hear the crack of rifle and be feebly aware of the shock as be drop to the earth where lie without sense or motion awake to find myself on my back upon the grass in our lair within the thicket someone have bring the water from the brook and lord john be sprinkle my head with it while challenger and summerlee be prop i up with concern in their face for moment have glimpse of the human spirit behind their scientific mask it be really shock rather than any injury which have prostrate i and in half an hour in spite of ache head and stiff neck be sit up and ready for anything "but you 've have the escape of your life young fellah my lad say lord roxton when hear your cry and run forward and see your head twist half off and your stohwasser kickin in the air think we be one short miss the beast in my flurry but he drop you all right and be off like streak by george wish have fifty man with rifle 'd clear out the whole infernal gang of they and leave this country bit clean than we find it "it be clear now that the ape man have in some way mark we down and that we be watch on every side we have not so much to fear from they during the day but they would be very likely to rush we by night so the soon we get away from their neighborhood the well on three side of we be absolute forest and there we might find ourselves in an ambush but on the fourth side that which slope down in the direction of the lake there be only low scrub with scatter tree and occasional open glade it be in fact the route which have myself take in my solitary journey and it lead we straight for the indian cave this then must for every reason be our road one great regret we have and that be to leave our old camp behind we not only for the sake of the store which remain there but even more because we be lose touch with zambo our link with the outside world however we have fair supply of cartridge and all our gun so for time at least we could look after ourselves and we hope soon to have chance of return and restore our communication with our negro he have faithfully promise to stay where he be and we have not doubt that he would be as good as his word it be in the early afternoon that we start upon our journey the young chief walk at our head as our guide but refuse indignantly to carry any burden behind he come the two survive indians with our scanty possession upon their back we four white man walk in the rear with rifle load and ready as we start there break from the thick silent wood behind we sudden great ululation of the ape man which may have be cheer of triumph at our departure or jeer of contempt at our flight look back we see only the dense screen of tree but that long draw yell tell we how many of our enemy lurk among they we see no sign of pursuit however and soon we have get into more open country and beyond their power as tramp along the rearmost of the four could not help smile at the appearance of my three companion in front be this the luxurious lord john roxton who have sit that evening in the albany amidst his persian rug and his picture in the pink radiance of the tint light and be this the impose professor who have swell behind the great desk in his massive study at enmore park and finally could this be the austere and prim figure which have rise before the meeting at the zoological institute no three tramp that one could have meet in surrey lane could have look more hopeless and bedraggle we have it be true be only week or so upon the top of the plateau but all our spare clothing be in our camp below and the one week have be severe one upon we all though least to i who have not to endure the handling of the ape man my three friend have all lose their hat and have now bind handkerchief round their head their clothe hang in ribbon about they and their unshaven grimy face be hardly to be recognize both summerlee and challenger be limp heavily while still drag my foot from weakness after the shock of the morning and my neck be as stiff as board from the murderous grip that hold it we be indeed sorry crew and do not wonder to see our indian companion glance back at we occasionally with horror and amazement on their face in the late afternoon we reach the margin of the lake and as we emerge from the bush and see the sheet of water stretch before we our native friend set up shrill cry of joy and point eagerly in front of they it be indeed wonderful sight which lie before we sweep over the glassy surface be great flotilla of canoe come straight for the shore upon which we stand they be some mile out when we first see they but they shoot forward with great swiftness and be soon so near that the rower could distinguish our person instantly thunderous shout of delight burst from they and we see they rise from their seat wave their paddle and spear madly in the air then bend to their work once more they fly across the intervene water beach their boat upon the slope sand and rush up to we prostrate themselves with loud cry of greeting before the young chief finally one of they an elderly man with necklace and bracelet of great lustrous glass bead and the skin of some beautiful mottled amber color animal sling over his shoulder run forward and embrace most tenderly the youth whom we have save he then look at we and ask some question after which he step up with much dignity and embrace we also each in turn then at his order the whole tribe lie down upon the ground before we in homage personally feel shy and uncomfortable at this obsequious adoration and read the same feeling in the face of roxton and summerlee but challenger expand like flower in the sun "they may be undeveloped type say he stroke his beard and look round at they but their deportment in the presence of their superior might be lesson to some of our more advanced europeans strange how correct be the instinct of the natural man!"it be clear that the native have come out upon the war path for every man carry his spear long bamboo tip with bone his bow and arrow and some sort of club or stone battle axe slung at his side their dark angry glance at the wood from which we have come and the frequent repetition of the word doda make it clear enough that this be rescue party who have set forth to save or revenge the old chief 's son for such we gather that the youth must be council be now hold by the whole tribe squat in circle whilst we sit near on slab of basalt and watch their proceeding two or three warrior speak and finally our young friend make spirited harangue with such eloquent feature and gesture that we could understand it all as clearly as if we have know his language "what be the use of return he say soon or later the thing must be do your comrade have be murder what if have return safe these other have be do to death there be no safety for any of we we be assemble now and ready then he point to we these strange man be our friend they be great fighter and they hate the ape man even as we do they command here he point up to heaven the thunder and the lightning when shall we have such chance again let we go forward and either die now or live for the future in safety how else shall we go back unashamed to our women?"the little red warrior hang upon the word of the speaker and when he have finish they burst into roar of applause wave their rude weapon in the air the old chief step forward to we and ask we some question point at the same time to the wood lord john make sign to he that he should wait for an answer and then he turn to we "well it be up to you to say what you will do say he for my part have score to settle with these monkey folk and if it end by wipe they off the face of the earth do n't see that the earth need fret about it be goin' with our little red pal and mean to see they through the scrap what do you say young fellah?""of course will come ""and you challenger?""i will assuredly co operate ""and you summerlee?""we seem to be drift very far from the object of this expedition lord john assure you that little think when leave my professional chair in london that it be for the purpose of head raid of savage upon colony of anthropoid ape ""to such base use do we come say lord john smile but we be up against it so what be the decision?""it seem most questionable step say summerlee argumentative to the last but if you be all go hardly see how can remain behind ""then it be settle say lord john and turn to the chief he nod and slap his rifle the old fellow clasp our hand each in turn while his man cheer louder than ever it be too late to advance that night so the indians settle down into rude bivouac on all side their fire begin to glimmer and smoke some of they who have disappear into the jungle come back presently drive young iguanodon before they like the other it have daub of asphalt upon its shoulder and it be only when we see one of the native step forward with the air of an owner and give his consent to the beast 's slaughter that we understand at last that these great creature be as much private property as herd of cattle and that these symbol which have so perplex we be nothing more than the mark of the owner helpless torpid and vegetarian with great limb but minute brain they could be round up and drive by child in few minute the huge beast have be cut up and slab of he be hang over dozen camp fire together with great scaly ganoid fish which have be spear in the lake summerlee have lain down and sleep upon the sand but we other roam round the edge of the water seek to learn something more of this strange country twice we find pit of blue clay such as we have already see in the swamp of the pterodactyls these be old volcanic vent and for some reason excite the great interest in lord john what attract challenger on the other hand be bubble gurgle mud geyser where some strange gas form great bursting bubble upon the surface he thrust hollow reed into it and cry out with delight like schoolboy then he be able on touch it with light match to cause sharp explosion and blue flame at the far end of the tube still more pleased be he when invert leathern pouch over the end of the reed and so fill it with the gas he be able to send it soar up into the air "an inflammable gas and one markedly light than the atmosphere should say beyond doubt that it contain considerable proportion of free hydrogen the resource of g. e. c. be not yet exhausted my young friend may yet show you how great mind mold all nature to its use he swell with some secret purpose but would say no more there be nothing which we could see upon the shore which seem to i so wonderful as the great sheet of water before we our number and our noise have frighten all living creature away and save for few pterodactyls which soar round high above our head while they wait for the carrion all be still around the camp but it be different out upon the rise tint water of the central lake it boil and heave with strange life great slate color back and high serrate dorsal fin shoot up with fringe of silver and then roll down into the depth again the sand bank far out be spot with uncouth crawl form huge turtle strange saurian and one great flat creature like writhing palpitate mat of black greasy leather which flop its way slowly to the lake here and there high serpent head project out of the water cut swiftly through it with little collar of foam in front and long swirling wake behind rise and fall in graceful swan like undulation as they go it be not until one of these creature wriggle on to sand bank within few hundred yard of we and expose barrel shape body and huge flipper behind the long serpent neck that challenger and summerlee who have join we break out into their duet of wonder and admiration "plesiosaurus fresh water plesiosaurus cry summerlee that should have live to see such sight we be bless my dear challenger above all zoologist since the world began!"it be not until the night have fall and the fire of our savage ally glow red in the shadow that our two man of science could be drag away from the fascination of that primeval lake even in the darkness as we lie upon the strand we hear from time to time the snort and plunge of the huge creature who live therein at early dawn our camp be astir and an hour later we have start upon our memorable expedition often in my dream have think that might live to be war correspondent in what wildest one could have conceive the nature of the campaign which it should be my lot to report here then be my first despatch from field of battle our number have be reinforce during the night by fresh batch of native from the cave and we may have be four or five hundred strong when we make our advance fringe of scout be throw out in front and behind they the whole force in solid column make their way up the long slope of the bush country until we be near the edge of the forest here they spread out into long straggling line of spearman and bowman roxton and summerlee take their position upon the right flank while challenger and be on the left it be host of the stone age that we be accompany to battle we with the last word of the gunsmith 's art from st. james street and the strand we have not long to wait for our enemy wild shrill clamor rise from the edge of the wood and suddenly body of ape man rush out with club and stone and make for the center of the indian line it be valiant move but foolish one for the great bandy legge creature be slow of foot while their opponent be as active as cat it be horrible to see the fierce brute with foaming mouth and glare eye rush and grasp but forever miss their elusive enemy while arrow after arrow bury itself in their hide one great fellow run past i roar with pain with dozen dart stick from his chest and rib in mercy put bullet through his skull and he fall sprawl among the aloe but this be the only shot fire for the attack have be on the center of the line and the indians there have need no help of ours in repulse it of all the ape man who have rush out into the open do not think that one get back to cover but the matter be more deadly when we come among the tree for an hour or more after we enter the wood there be desperate struggle in which for time we hardly hold our own spring out from among the scrub the ape man with huge club break in upon the indians and often fell three or four of they before they could be spear their frightful blow shatter everything upon which they fall one of they knock summerlee 's rifle to matchwood and the next would have crush his skull have an indian not stab the beast to the heart other ape man in the tree above we hurl down stone and log of wood occasionally drop bodily on to our rank and fight furiously until they be fell once our ally break under the pressure and have it not be for the execution do by our rifle they would certainly have take to their heel but they be gallantly rally by their old chief and come on with such rush that the ape man begin in turn to give way summerlee be weaponless but be empty my magazine as quick as could fire and on the further flank we hear the continuous cracking of our companion 's rifle then in moment come the panic and the collapse scream and howl the great creature rush away in all direction through the brushwood while our ally yell in their savage delight follow swiftly after their fly enemy all the feud of countless generation all the hatred and cruelty of their narrow history all the memory of ill usage and persecution be to be purge that day at last man be to be supreme and the man beast to find forever his allotted place fly as they would the fugitive be too slow to escape from the active savage and from every side in the tangled wood we hear the exultant yell the twanging of bow and the crash and thud as ape man be bring down from their hiding place in the tree be follow the other when find that lord john and challenger have come across to join we "it be over say lord john think we can leave the tidying up to they perhaps the less we see of it the well we shall sleep "challenger 's eye be shine with the lust of slaughter "we have be privileged he cry strut about like gamecock to be present at one of the typical decisive battle of history the battle which have determine the fate of the world what my friend be the conquest of one nation by another it be meaningless each produce the same result but those fierce fight when in the dawn of the age the cave dweller hold their own against the tiger folk or the elephant first find that they have master those be the real conquest the victory that count by this strange turn of fate we have see and help to decide even such contest now upon this plateau the future must ever be for man "it need robust faith in the end to justify such tragic mean as we advance together through the wood we find the ape man lie thick transfix with spear or arrow here and there little group of shatter indians mark where one of the anthropoid have turn to bay and sell his life dearly always in front of we we hear the yell and roaring which show the direction of the pursuit the ape man have be drive back to their city they have make last stand there once again they have be break and now we be in time to see the final fearful scene of all some eighty or hundred male the last survivor have be drive across that same little clearing which lead to the edge of the cliff the scene of our own exploit two day before as we arrive the indians semicircle of spearman have close in on they and in minute it be over thirty or forty die where they stand the other scream and clawing be thrust over the precipice and went hurtle down as their prisoner have of old on to the sharp bamboo six hundred foot below it be as challenger have say and the reign of man be assure forever in maple white land the male be exterminate ape town be destroy the female and young be drive away to live in bondage and the long rivalry of untold century have reach its bloody end for we the victory bring much advantage once again we be able to visit our camp and get at our store once more also we be able to communicate with zambo who have be terrify by the spectacle from afar of an avalanche of ape fall from the edge of the cliff "come away massas come away he cry his eye start from his head the debbil get you sure if you stay up there ""it be the voice of sanity say summerlee with conviction we have have adventure enough and they be neither suitable to our character or our position hold you to your word challenger from now onwards you devote your energy to get we out of this horrible country and back once more to civilization "i write this from day to day but trust that before come to the end of it may be able to say that the light shine at last through our cloud we be hold here with no clear mean of make our escape and bitterly we chafe against it yet can well imagine that the day may come when we may be glad that we be keep against our will to see something more of the wonder of this singular place and of the creature who inhabit it the victory of the indians and the annihilation of the ape man mark the turning point of our fortune from then onwards we be in truth master of the plateau for the native look upon we with mixture of fear and gratitude since by our strange power we have aid they to destroy their hereditary foe for their own sake they would perhaps be glad to see the departure of such formidable and incalculable people but they have not themselves suggest any way by which we may reach the plain below there have be so far as we could follow their sign tunnel by which the place could be approach the low exit of which we have see from below by this no doubt both ape man and indians have at different epoch reach the top and maple white with his companion have take the same way only the year before however there have be terrific earthquake and the upper end of the tunnel have fall in and completely disappear the indians now could only shake their head and shrug their shoulder when we express by sign our desire to descend it may be that they can not but it may also be that they will not help we to get away at the end of the victorious campaign the survive ape folk be drive across the plateau their wailing be horrible and establish in the neighborhood of the indian cave where they would from now onwards be servile race under the eye of their master it be rude raw primeval version of the jews in babylon or the israelites in egypt at night we could hear from amid the tree the long draw cry as some primitive ezekiel mourn for fall greatness and recall the depart glory of ape town hewer of wood and drawer of water such be they from now onwards we have return across the plateau with our ally two day after the battle and make our camp at the foot of their cliff they would have have we share their cave with they but lord john would by no mean consent to it consider that to do so would put we in their power if they be treacherously disposed we keep our independence therefore and have our weapon ready for any emergency while preserve the most friendly relation we also continually visit their cave which be most remarkable place though whether make by man or by nature we have never be able to determine they be all on the one stratum hollow out of some soft rock which lie between the volcanic basalt form the ruddy cliff above they and the hard granite which form their base the opening be about eighty foot above the ground and be lead up to by long stone stair so narrow and steep that no large animal could mount they inside they be warm and dry run in straight passage of vary length into the side of the hill with smooth gray wall decorate with many excellent picture do with charred stick and represent the various animal of the plateau if every living thing be sweep from the country the future explorer would find upon the wall of these cave ample evidence of the strange fauna the dinosaur iguanodon and fish lizard which have live so recently upon earth since we have learn
