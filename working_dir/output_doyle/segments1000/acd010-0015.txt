that the huge iguanodon be keep as tame herd by their owner and be simply walk meat store we have conceive that man even with his primitive weapon have establish his ascendancy upon the plateau we be soon to discover that it be not so and that he be still there upon tolerance it be on the third day after our form our camp near the indian cave that the tragedy occur challenger and summerlee have go off together that day to the lake where some of the native under their direction be engage in harpoon specimen of the great lizard lord john and have remain in our camp while number of the indians be scatter about upon the grassy slope in front of the cave engage in different way suddenly there be shrill cry of alarm with the word stoa resounding from hundred tongue from every side man woman and child be rush wildly for shelter swarm up the staircase and into the cave in mad stampede look up we could see they wave their arm from the rock above and beckon to we to join they in their refuge we have both seize our magazine rifle and run out to see what the danger could be suddenly from the near belt of tree there break forth group of twelve or fifteen indians run for their life and at their very heel two of those frightful monster which have disturb our camp and pursue i upon my solitary journey in shape they be like horrible toad and move in succession of spring but in size they be of an incredible bulk large than the large elephant we have never before see they save at night and indeed they be nocturnal animal save when disturb in their lair as these have be we now stand amazed at the sight for their blotched and warty skin be of curious fish like iridescence and the sunlight strike they with an ever vary rainbow bloom as they move we have little time to watch they however for in an instant they have overtake the fugitive and be make dire slaughter among they their method be to fall forward with their full weight upon each in turn leave he crush and mangle to bind on after the other the wretched indians scream with terror but be helpless run as they would before the relentless purpose and horrible activity of these monstrous creature one after another they go down and there be not half dozen surviving by the time my companion and could come to their help but our aid be of little avail and only involve we in the same peril at the range of couple of hundred yard we empty our magazine fire bullet after bullet into the beast but with no more effect than if we be pelt they with pellet of paper their slow reptilian nature care nothing for wound and the spring of their life with no special brain center but scatter throughout their spinal cord could not be tap by any modern weapon the most that we could do be to check their progress by distract their attention with the flash and roar of our gun and so to give both the native and ourselves time to reach the step which lead to safety but where the conical explosive bullet of the twentieth century be of no avail the poison arrow of the native dip in the juice of strophanthu and steep afterwards in decayed carrion could succeed such arrow be of little avail to the hunter who attack the beast because their action in that torpid circulation be slow and before its power fail it could certainly overtake and slay its assailant but now as the two monster hound we to the very foot of the stair drift of dart came whistle from every chink in the cliff above they in minute they be feather with they and yet with no sign of pain they claw and slobber with impotent rage at the step which would lead they to their victim mount clumsily up for few yard and then slide down again to the ground but at last the poison work one of they give deep rumble groan and drop his huge squat head on to the earth the other bound round in an eccentric circle with shrill wail cry and then lie down writhe in agony for some minute before it also stiffen and lie still with yell of triumph the indians came flock down from their cave and dance frenzied dance of victory round the dead body in mad joy that two more of the most dangerous of all their enemy have be slay that night they cut up and remove the body not to eat for the poison be still active but lest they should breed pestilence the great reptilian heart however each as large as cushion still lie there beat slowly and steadily with gentle rise and fall in horrible independent life it be only upon the third day that the ganglia run down and the dreadful thing be still some day when have well desk than meat tin and more helpful tool than worn stub of pencil and last tattered note book will write some full account of the accala indians of our life amongst they and of the glimpse which we have of the strange condition of wondrous maple white land memory at least will never fail i for so long as the breath of life be in i every hour and every action of that period will stand out as hard and clear as do the first strange happening of our childhood no new impression could efface those which be so deeply cut when the time come will describe that wondrous moonlit night upon the great lake when young ichthyosauru strange creature half seal half fish to look at with bone cover eye on each side of his snout and third eye fix upon the top of his head be entangle in an indian net and nearly upset our canoe before we tow it ashore the same night that green water snake shoot out from the rush and carry off in its coil the steersman of challenger 's canoe will tell too of the great nocturnal white thing to this day we do not know whether it be beast or reptile which live in vile swamp to the east of the lake and flit about with faint phosphorescent glimmer in the darkness the indians be so terrified at it that they would not go near the place and though we twice make expedition and see it each time we could not make our way through the deep marsh in which it live can only say that it seem to be large than cow and have the strange musky odor will tell also of the huge bird which chase challenger to the shelter of the rock one day great run bird far tall than an ostrich with vulture like neck and cruel head which make it walk death as challenger climb to safety one dart of that savage curve beak shore off the heel of his boot as if it have be cut with chisel this time at least modern weapon prevail and the great creature twelve foot from head to foot phororachus its name accord to our panting but exultant professor go down before lord roxton 's rifle in flurry of wave feather and kick limb with two remorseless yellow eye glare up from the midst of it may live to see that flatten vicious skull in its own niche amid the trophy of the albany finally will assuredly give some account of the toxodon the giant ten foot guinea pig with project chisel tooth which we kill as it drink in the gray of the morning by the side of the lake all this shall some day write at full length and amidst these more stirring day would tenderly sketch in these lovely summer evening when with the deep blue sky above we we lie in good comradeship among the long grass by the wood and marvel at the strange fowl that sweep over we and the quaint new creature which creep from their burrow to watch we while above we the bough of the bush be heavy with luscious fruit and below we strange and lovely flower peep at we from among the herbage or those long moonlit night when we lie out upon the shimmering surface of the great lake and watch with wonder and awe the huge circle ripple out from the sudden splash of some fantastic monster or the greenish gleam far down in the deep water of some strange creature upon the confine of darkness these be the scene which my mind and my pen will dwell upon in every detail at some future day but you will ask why these experience and why this delay when you and your comrade should have be occupy day and night in the devising of some mean by which you could return to the outer world my answer be that there be not one of we who be not work for this end but that our work have be in vain one fact we have very speedily discover the indians would do nothing to help we in every other way they be our friend one might almost say our devoted slave but when it be suggest that they should help we to make and carry plank which would bridge the chasm or when we wish to get from they thong of leather or liana to weave rope which might help we we be meet by good humored but an invincible refusal they would smile twinkle their eye shake their head and there be the end of it even the old chief meet we with the same obstinate denial and it be only maretas the youngster whom we have save who look wistfully at we and tell we by his gesture that he be grieve for our thwart wish ever since their crown triumph with the ape man they look upon we as superman who bear victory in the tube of strange weapon and they believe that so long as we remain with they good fortune would be theirs little red skinned wife and cave of our own be freely offer to each of we if we would but forget our own people and dwell forever upon the plateau so far all have be kindly however far apart our desire might be but we feel well assure that our actual plan of descent must be keep secret for we have reason to fear that at the last they might try to hold we by force in spite of the danger from dinosaur which be not great save at night for as may have say before they be mostly nocturnal in their habit have twice in the last three week be over to our old camp in order to see our negro who still keep watch and ward below the cliff my eye strain eagerly across the great plain in the hope of see afar off the help for which we have pray but the long cactus strew level still stretch away empty and bare to the distant line of the cane brake "they will soon come now massa malone before another week pass indian come back and bring rope and fetch you down such be the cheery cry of our excellent zambo have one strange experience as come from this second visit which have involve my be away for night from my companion be return along the well remember route and have reach spot within mile or so of the marsh of the pterodactyls when see an extraordinary object approach i it be man who walk inside framework make of bent cane so that he be enclose on all side in bell shape cage as draw near be more amazed still to see that it be lord john roxton when he see i he slip from under his curious protection and come towards i laugh and yet as think with some confusion in his manner "well young fellah say he who would have think of meetin you up here?""what in the world be you do ask "visitin my friend the pterodactyls say he "but why?""interestin beast do n't you think but unsociable nasty rude way with stranger as you may remember so rig this framework which keep they from bein too pressin in their attention ""but what do you want in the swamp?"he look at i with very question eye and read hesitation in his face "don't you think other people besides professors can want to know thing he say at last be studyin the pretty dear that be enough for you ""no offense say i. his good humor return and he laugh "no offense young fellah be goin' to get young devil chick for challenger that be one of my job no do n't want your company be safe in this cage and you be not so long and 'll be back in camp by night fall "he turn away and leave he wander on through the wood with his extraordinary cage around he if lord john 's behavior at this time be strange that of challenger be more so may say that he seem to possess an extraordinary fascination for the indian woman and that he always carry large spread palm branch with which he beat they off as if they be fly when their attention become too pressing to see he walk like comic opera sultan with this badge of authority in his hand his black beard bristle in front of he his toe point at each step and train of wide eyed indian girl behind he clothe in their slender drapery of bark cloth be one of the most grotesque of all the picture which will carry back with i as to summerlee he be absorb in the insect and bird life of the plateau and spend his whole time save that considerable portion which be devoted to abuse challenger for not get we out of our difficulty in clean and mount his specimen challenger have be in the habit of walk off by himself every morning and return from time to time with look of portentous solemnity as one who bear the full weight of great enterprise upon his shoulder one day palm branch in hand and his crowd of adore devotee behind he he lead we down to his hide work shop and take we into the secret of his plan the place be small clearing in the center of palm grove in this be one of those boil mud geyser which have already describe around its edge be scatter number of leathern thong cut from iguanodon hide and large collapse membrane which prove to be the dried and scrape stomach of one of the great fish lizard from the lake this huge sack have be sew up at one end and only small orifice leave at the other into this open several bamboo cane have be insert and the other end of these cane be in contact with conical clay funnel which collect the gas bubble up through the mud of the geyser soon the flaccid organ begin to slowly expand and show such tendency to upward movement that challenger fasten the cord which hold it to the trunk of the surround tree in half an hour good sized gas bag have be form and the jerk and strain upon the thong show that it be capable of considerable lift challenger like glad father in the presence of his first bear stand smile and stroke his beard in silent self satisfied content as he gaze at the creation of his brain it be summerlee who first break the silence "you do n't mean we to go up in that thing challenger say he in an acid voice "i mean my dear summerlee to give you such demonstration of its power that after see it you will be sure have no hesitation in trust yourself to it ""you can put it right out of your head now at once say summerlee with decision nothing on earth would induce i to commit such folly lord john trust that you will not countenance such madness?""dooced ingenious call it say our peer 'd like to see how it work ""so you shall say challenger for some day have exert my whole brain force upon the problem of how we shall descend from these cliff we have satisfy ourselves that we can not climb down and that there be no tunnel we be also unable to construct any kind of bridge which may take we back to the pinnacle from which we come how then shall find means to convey we some little time ago have remark to our young friend here that free hydrogen be evolve from the geyser the idea of balloon naturally follow be will admit somewhat baffle by the difficulty of discover an envelope to contain the gas but the contemplation of the immense entrail of these reptile supply i with solution to the problem behold the result!"he put one hand in the front of his ragged jacket and point proudly with the other by this time the gas bag have swell to goodly rotundity and be jerk strongly upon its lashing "midsummer madness snort summerlee lord john be delighted with the whole idea clever old dear ai n't he he whisper to i and then louder to challenger what about car?""the car will be my next care have already plan how it be to be make and attach meanwhile will simply show you how capable my apparatus be of support the weight of each of we ""all of we surely?""no it be part of my plan that each in turn shall descend as in parachute and the balloon be draw back by mean which shall have no difficulty in perfect if it will support the weight of one and let he gently down it will have do all that be require of it will now show you its capacity in that direction "he bring out lump of basalt of considerable size construct in the middle so that cord could be easily attach to it this cord be the one which we have bring with we on to the plateau after we have use it for climb the pinnacle it be over hundred foot long and though it be thin it be very strong he have prepare sort of collar of leather with many strap depend from it this collar be place over the dome of the balloon and the hang thong be gather together below so that the pressure of any weight would be diffuse over considerable surface then the lump of basalt be fasten to the thong and the rope be allow to hang from the end of it be pass three time round the professor 's arm "i will now say challenger with smile of pleased anticipation demonstrate the carry power of my balloon as he say so he cut with knife the various lashing that hold it never be our expedition in more imminent danger of complete annihilation the inflated membrane shoot up with frightful velocity into the air in an instant challenger be pull off his foot and drag after it have just time to throw my arm round his ascend waist when be myself whip up into the air lord john have i with rat trap grip round the leg but feel that he also be come off the ground for moment have vision of four adventurer float like string of sausage over the land that they have explore but happily there be limit to the strain which the rope would stand though none apparently to the lift power of this infernal machine there be sharp crack and we be in heap upon the ground with coil of rope all over we when we be able to stagger to our foot we see far off in the deep blue sky one dark spot where the lump of basalt be speed upon its way "splendid cry the undaunted challenger rub his injure arm most thorough and satisfactory demonstration could not have anticipate such success within week gentleman promise that second balloon will be prepare and that you can count upon take in safety and comfort the first stage of our homeward journey so far have write each of the foregoing event as it occur now be round off my narrative from the old camp where zambo have wait so long with all our difficulty and danger leave like dream behind we upon the summit of those vast ruddy crag which tower above our head we have descend in safety though in most unexpected fashion and all be well with we in six week or two month we shall be in london and it be possible that this letter may not reach you much early than we do ourselves already our heart yearn and our spirit fly towards the great mother city which hold so much that be dear to we it be on the very evening of our perilous adventure with challenger 's home make balloon that the change come in our fortune have say that the one person from whom we have have some sign of sympathy in our attempt to get away be the young chief whom we have rescue he alone have no desire to hold we against our will in strange land he have tell we as much by his expressive language of sign that evening after dusk he come down to our little camp hand i for some reason he have always show his attention to i perhaps because be the one who be near his age small roll of the bark of tree and then point solemnly up at the row of cave above he he have put his finger to his lip as sign of secrecy and have steal back again to his people take the slip of bark to the firelight and we examine it together it be about foot square and on the inner side there be singular arrangement of line which here reproduce they be neatly do in charcoal upon the white surface and look to i at first sight like some sort of rough musical score "whatever it be can swear that it be of importance to we say i. could read that on his face as he give it ""unless we have come upon primitive practical joker summerlee suggest which should think would be one of the most elementary development of man ""it be clearly some sort of script say challenger "look like guinea puzzle competition remark lord john crane his neck to have look at it then suddenly he stretch out his hand and seize the puzzle "by george he cry believe 've get it the boy guess right the very first time see here how many mark be on that paper eighteen well if you come to think of it there be eighteen cave opening on the hill side above we ""he point up to the cave when he give it to i say i."well that settle it this be chart of the cave what eighteen of they all in row some short some deep some branching same as we see they it be map and here be cross on it what be the cross for it be place to mark one that be much deep than the other ""one that go through cry "i believe our young friend have read the riddle say challenger if the cave do not go through do not understand why this person who have every reason to mean we well should have draw our attention to it but if it do go through and come out at the corresponding point on the other side we should not have more than hundred foot to descend ""a hundred foot grumble summerlee "well our rope be still more than hundred foot long cry surely we could get down ""how about the indians in the cave summerlee object "there be no indians in any of the cave above our head say i. they be all use as barn and store house why should we not go up now at once and spy out the land?"there be dry bituminous wood upon the plateau specie of araucaria accord to our botanist which be always use by the indians for torch each of we pick up faggot of this and we make our way up weed cover step to the particular cave which be mark in the drawing it be as have say empty save for great number of enormous bat which flap round our head as we advance into it as we have no desire to draw the attention of the indians to our proceeding we stumble along in the dark until we have go round several curve and penetrate considerable distance into the cavern then at last we light our torch it be beautiful dry tunnel with smooth gray wall cover with native symbol curved roof which arch over our head and white glistening sand beneath our foot we hurry eagerly along it until with deep groan of bitter disappointment we be bring to halt sheer wall of rock have appear
