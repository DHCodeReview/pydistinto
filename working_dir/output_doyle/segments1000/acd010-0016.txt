before we with no chink through which mouse could have slip there be no escape for we there we stand with bitter heart stare at this unexpected obstacle it be not the result of any convulsion as in the case of the ascending tunnel the end wall be exactly like the side one it be and have always be cul de sac "never mind my friend say the indomitable challenger you have still my firm promise of balloon "summerlee groaned "can we be in the wrong cave suggest "no use young fellah say lord john with his finger on the chart seventeen from the right and second from the left this be the cave sure enough "i look at the mark to which his finger point and give sudden cry of joy "i believe have it follow i follow me!"i hurry back along the way we have come my torch in my hand here say point to some match upon the ground be where we light up ""exactly ""well it be mark as fork cave and in the darkness we pass the fork before the torch be light on the right side as we go out we should find the long arm "it be as have say we have not go thirty yard before great black opening loom in the wall we turn into it to find that we be in much large passage than before along it we hurry in breathless impatience for many hundred of yard then suddenly in the black darkness of the arch in front of we we see gleam of dark red light we stare in amazement sheet of steady flame seem to cross the passage and to bar our way we hasten towards it no sound no heat no movement come from it but still the great luminous curtain glow before we silver all the cave and turn the sand to powdered jewel until as we draw close it discover circular edge "the moon by george cry lord john we be through boy we be through!"it be indeed the full moon which shine straight down the aperture which open upon the cliff it be small rift not large than window but it be enough for all our purpose as we crane our neck through it we could see that the descent be not very difficult one and that the level ground be no very great way below we it be no wonder that from below we have not observe the place as the cliff curve overhead and an ascent at the spot would have seem so impossible as to discourage close inspection we satisfy ourselves that with the help of our rope we could find our way down and then return rejoicing to our camp to make our preparation for the next evening what we do we have to do quickly and secretly since even at this last hour the indians might hold we back our store we would leave behind we save only our gun and cartridge but challenger have some unwieldy stuff which he ardently desire to take with he and one particular package of which may not speak which give we more labor than any slowly the day pass but when the darkness fall we be ready for our departure with much labor we get our thing up the step and then look back take one last long survey of that strange land soon fear to be vulgarize the prey of hunter and prospector but to each of we dreamland of glamour and romance land where we have dare much suffer much and learn much our land as we shall ever fondly call it along upon our left the neighboring cave each throw out its ruddy cheery firelight into the gloom from the slope below we rise the voice of the indians as they laugh and sing beyond be the long sweep of the wood and in the center shimmer vaguely through the gloom be the great lake the mother of strange monster even as we look high whicker cry the call of some weird animal ring clear out of the darkness it be the very voice of maple white land bid we good bye we turn and plunge into the cave which lead to home two hour later we our package and all we own be at the foot of the cliff save for challenger 's luggage we have never difficulty leave it all where we descend we start at once for zambo 's camp in the early morning we approach it but only to find to our amazement not one fire but dozen upon the plain the rescue party have arrive there be twenty indians from the river with stake rope and all that could be useful for bridge the chasm at least we shall have no difficulty now in carry our package when to morrow we begin to make our way back to the amazon and so in humble and thankful mood close this account our eye have see great wonder and our soul be chasten by what we have endure each be in his own way well and deep man it may be that when we reach para we shall stop to refit if we do this letter will be mail ahead if not it will reach london on the very day that do in either case my dear mr. mcardle hope very soon to shake you by the hand should wish to place upon record here our gratitude to all our friend upon the amazon for the very great kindness and hospitality which be show to we upon our return journey very particularly would thank senhor penalosa and other official of the brazilian government for the special arrangement by which we be help upon our way and senhor pereira of para to whose forethought we owe the complete outfit for decent appearance in the civilized world which we find ready for we at that town it seem poor return for all the courtesy which we encounter that we should deceive our host and benefactor but under the circumstance we have really no alternative and hereby tell they that they will only waste their time and their money if they attempt to follow upon our trace even the name have be alter in our account and be very sure that no one from the most careful study of they could come within thousand mile of our unknown land the excitement which have be cause through those part of south america which we have to traverse be imagine by we to be purely local and can assure our friend in england that we have no notion of the uproar which the mere rumor of our experience have cause through europe it be not until the ivernia be within five hundred mile of southampton that the wireless message from paper after paper and agency after agency offer huge price for short return message as to our actual result show we how strained be the attention not only of the scientific world but of the general public it be agree among we however that no definite statement should be give to the press until we have meet the member of the zoological institute since as delegate it be our clear duty to give our first report to the body from which we have receive our commission of investigation thus although we find southampton full of pressmen we absolutely refuse to give any information which have the natural effect of focusse public attention upon the meeting which be advertise for the evening of november 7th for this gathering the zoological hall which have be the scene of the inception of our task be find to be far too small and it be only in the queen 's hall in regent street that accommodation could be find it be now common knowledge the promoter might have venture upon the albert hall and still find their space too scanty it be for the second evening after our arrival that the great meeting have be fix for the first we have each no doubt our own press personal affair to absorb we of mine can not yet speak it may be that as it stand far from i may think of it and even speak of it with less emotion have show the reader in the beginning of this narrative where lie the spring of my action it be but right perhaps that should carry on the tale and show also the result and yet the day may come when would not have it otherwise at least have be drive forth to take part in wondrous adventure and can not but be thankful to the force that drive i and now turn to the last supreme eventful moment of our adventure as be rack my brain as to how should well describe it my eye fall upon the issue of my own journal for the morning of the 8th of november with the full and excellent account of my friend and fellow reporter macdona what can do well than transcribe his narrative head line and all admit that the paper be exuberant in the matter out of compliment to its own enterprise in send correspondent but the other great daily be hardly less full in their account thus then friend mac in his report great meeting at the queen 's hall scenes of uproar extraordinary incident what be it nocturnal riot in regent street special)"the much discuss meeting of the zoological institute convene to hear the report of the committee of investigation send out last year to south america to test the assertion make by professor challenger as to the continued existence of prehistoric life upon that continent be hold last night in the great queen 's hall and it be safe to say that it be likely to be red letter date in the history of science for the proceeding be of so remarkable and sensational character that no one present be ever likely to forget they oh brother scribe macdona what monstrous opening sentence the ticket be theoretically confine to member and their friend but the latter be an elastic term and long before eight o'clock the hour fix for the commencement of the proceeding all part of the great hall be tightly pack the general public however which most unreasonably entertain grievance at having be exclude storm the door at quarter to eight after prolong melee in which several people be injure include inspector scoble of h. division whose leg be unfortunately broken after this unwarrantable invasion which not only fill every passage but even intrude upon the space set apart for the press it be estimate that nearly five thousand people await the arrival of the traveler when they eventually appear they take their place in the front of platform which already contain all the lead scientific man not only of this country but of france and of germany sweden be also represent in the person of professor sergius the famous zoologist of the university of upsala the entrance of the four hero of the occasion be the signal for remarkable demonstration of welcome the whole audience rise and cheer for some minute an acute observer might however have detect some sign of dissent amid the applause and gather that the proceeding be likely to become more lively than harmonious it may safely be prophesy however that no one could have foresee the extraordinary turn which they be actually to take "of the appearance of the four wanderer little need be say since their photograph have for some time be appear in all the paper they bear few trace of the hardship which they be say to have undergo professor challenger 's beard may be more shaggy professor summerlee 's feature more ascetic lord john roxton 's figure more gaunt and all three may be burn to dark tint than when they leave our shore but each appear to be in most excellent health as to our own representative the well know athlete and international rugby football player e. d. malone he look train to hair and as he survey the crowd smile of good humored contentment pervade his honest but homely face all right mac wait till get you alone!)"when quiet have be restore and the audience resume their seat after the ovation which they have give to the traveler the chairman the duke of durham address the meeting he would not he say stand for more than moment between that vast assembly and the treat which lie before they it be not for he to anticipate what professor summerlee who be the spokesman of the committee have to say to they but it be common rumor that their expedition have be crown by extraordinary success applause apparently the age of romance be not dead and there be common ground upon which the wild imagining of the novelist could meet the actual scientific investigation of the searcher for truth he would only add before he sit down that he rejoice and all of they would rejoice that these gentleman have return safe and sound from their difficult and dangerous task for it can not be deny that any disaster to such an expedition would have inflict well nigh irreparable loss to the cause of zoological science great applause in which professor challenger be observe to join.)"professor summerlee 's rise be the signal for another extraordinary outbreak of enthusiasm which break out again at interval throughout his address that address will not be give in extenso in these column for the reason that full account of the whole adventure of the expedition be be publish as supplement from the pen of our own special correspondent some general indication will therefore suffice having describe the genesis of their journey and pay handsome tribute to his friend professor challenger couple with an apology for the incredulity with which his assertion now fully vindicate have be receive he give the actual course of their journey carefully withhold such information as would aid the public in any attempt to locate this remarkable plateau having describe in general term their course from the main river up to the time that they actually reach the base of the cliff he enthral his hearer by his account of the difficulty encounter by the expedition in their repeat attempt to mount they and finally describe how they succeed in their desperate endeavor which cost the life of their two devoted half breed servant this amazing reading of the affair be the result of summerlee 's endeavor to avoid raise any questionable matter at the meeting.)"having conduct his audience in fancy to the summit and maroon they there by reason of the fall of their bridge the professor proceed to describe both the horror and the attraction of that remarkable land of personal adventure he say little but lay stress upon the rich harvest reap by science in the observation of the wonderful beast bird insect and plant life of the plateau peculiarly rich in the coleoptera and in the lepidoptera forty six new specie of the one and ninety four of the other have be secure in the course of few week it be however in the large animal and especially in the large animal suppose to have be long extinct that the interest of the public be naturally center of these he be able to give goodly list but have little doubt that it would be largely extend when the place have be more thoroughly investigate he and his companion have see at least dozen creature most of they at distance which correspond with nothing at present know to science these would in time be duly classify and examine he instance snake the cast skin of which deep purple in color be fifty one foot in length and mention white creature suppose to be mammalian which give forth well mark phosphorescence in the darkness also large black moth the bite of which be suppose by the indians to be highly poisonous set aside these entirely new form of life the plateau be very rich in know prehistoric form date back in some case to early jurassic time among these he mention the gigantic and grotesque stegosaurus see once by mr. malone at drinking place by the lake and draw in the sketch book of that adventurous american who have first penetrate this unknown world he describe also the iguanodon and the pterodactyl two of the first of the wonder which they have encounter he then thrill the assembly by some account of the terrible carnivorous dinosaur which have on more than one occasion pursue member of the party and which be the most formidable of all the creature which they have encounter thence he pass to the huge and ferocious bird the phororachus and to the great elk which still roam upon this upland it be not however until he sketch the mystery of the central lake that the full interest and enthusiasm of the audience be arouse one have to pinch oneself to be sure that one be awake as one hear this sane and practical professor in cold measure tone describe the monstrous three eyed fish lizard and the huge water snake which inhabit this enchanted sheet of water next he touch upon the indians and upon the extraordinary colony of anthropoid ape which might be look upon as an advance upon the pithecanthropus of java and as come therefore near than any know form to that hypothetical creation the missing link finally he describe amongst some merriment the ingenious but highly dangerous aeronautic invention of professor challenger and wound up most memorable address by an account of the method by which the committee do at last find their way back to civilization "it have be hope that the proceeding would end there and that vote of thank and congratulation move by professor sergius of upsala university would be duly second and carry but it be soon evident that the course of event be not destine to flow so smoothly symptom of opposition have be evident from time to time during the evening and now dr. james illingworth of edinburgh rise in the center of the hall dr. illingworth ask whether an amendment should not be take before resolution "the chairman yes sir if there must be an amendment '"dr illingworth your grace there must be an amendment '"the chairman then let we take it at once '"professor summerlee spring to his foot ): might explain your grace that this man be my personal enemy ever since our controversy in the quarterly journal of science as to the true nature of bathybius?'"the chairman fear can not go into personal matter proceed '"dr illingworth be imperfectly hear in part of his remark on account of the strenuous opposition of the friend of the explorer some attempt be also make to pull he down be man of enormous physique however and possess of very powerful voice he dominate the tumult and succeed in finish his speech it be clear from the moment of his rise that he have number of friend and sympathizer in the hall though they form minority in the audience the attitude of the great part of the public might be describe as one of attentive neutrality "dr illingworth begin his remark by express his high appreciation of the scientific work both of professor challenger and of professor summerlee he much regret that any personal bias should have be read into his remark which be entirely dictate by his desire for scientific truth his position in fact be substantially the same as that take up by professor summerlee at the last meeting at that last meeting professor challenger have make certain assertion which have be query by his colleague now this colleague come forward himself with the same assertion and expect they to remain unquestioned be this reasonable yes no and prolonged interruption during which professor challenger be hear from the press box to ask leave from the chairman to put dr. illingworth into the street year ago one man say certain thing now four man say other and more startling one be this to constitute final proof where the matter in question be of the most revolutionary and incredible character there have be recent example of traveler arrive from the unknown with certain tale which have be too readily accept be the london zoological institute to place itself in this position he admit that the member of the committee be man of character but human nature be very complex even professor might be mislead by the desire for notoriety like moth we all love good to flutter in the light heavy game shot like to be in position to cap the tale of their rival and journalist be not averse from sensational coup even when imagination have to aid fact in the process each member of the committee have his own motive for make the most of his result shame shame he have no desire to be offensive you be and interruption the corroboration of these wondrous tale be really of the most slend description what do it amount to some photograph \{was it possible that in this age of ingenious manipulation photograph could be accept as evidence?\ what more we have story of flight and descent by rope which preclude the production of large specimen it be ingenious but not convincing it be understand that lord john roxton claim to have the skull of phororachus he could only say that he would like to see that skull "lord john roxton be this fellow call i liar uproar.)"the chairman order order dr. illingworth must direct you to bring your remark to conclusion and to move your amendment '"dr illingworth your grace have more to say but bow to your ruling move then that while professor summerlee be thank for his interesting address the whole matter shall be regard as non proven and shall be refer back to large and possibly more reliable committee of investigation '"it be difficult to describe the confusion cause by this amendment large section of the audience express their indignation at such slur upon the traveler by noisy shout of dissent and cry of do n't put it withdraw turn he out on the other hand the malcontent and it can not be deny that they be fairly numerous cheer for the amendment with cry of order chair and fair play scuffle break out in the back bench and blow be freely exchange among the medical student who crowd that part of the hall it be only the moderate influence of the presence of large number of lady which prevent an absolute riot suddenly however there be pause hush and then complete silence professor challenger be on his foot his appearance and manner be peculiarly arrest and as he raise his hand for order the whole audience settle down expectantly to give he hearing "'it will be within the recollection of many present say professor challenger that similar foolish and unmannerly scene mark the last meeting at which have be able to address they on that occasion professor summerlee be the chief offender and though he be now chastened and contrite the matter could not be entirely forget have hear to night similar but even more offensive sentiment from the person who have just sit down and though it be conscious effort of self effacement to come down to that person 's mental level will endeavor to do so in order to allay any reasonable doubt which could possibly exist in the mind of anyone laughter and interruption need not remind this audience that though professor summerlee as the head of the committee of investigation have be put up to speak to night still it be who be the real prime mover in this business and that it be mainly to i that any successful result must be ascribe have safely conduct these three gentleman to the spot mention and have as you have hear convince they of the accuracy of my previous account we have hope that we should find upon our return that no one be so dense as to dispute our joint conclusion warn however by my previous experience have not come without such proof as may convince reasonable man as explain by professor summerlee our camera have be tamper with by the ape man when they ransack our camp and most of our negative ruin jeer laughter and tell we another from the back have mention the ape man and can not forbear from say that some of the sound which now meet my ear bring back most vividly to my recollection my experience with those interesting creature laughter in spite of the destruction of so many invaluable negative there still remain in our collection certain number of corroborative photograph show the condition of life upon the plateau do they accuse they of having forge these photograph voice yes and considerable interruption which end in several man be put out of the hall the negative be open to the inspection of expert but what other evidence have they under the condition of their escape it be naturally impossible to bring large
