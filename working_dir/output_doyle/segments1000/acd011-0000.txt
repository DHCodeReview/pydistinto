be inclined to think say i."i should do so sherlock holmes remark impatiently believe that be one of the most long suffering of mortal but 'll admit that be annoy at the sardonic interruption really holmes say severely you be little try at time "he be too much absorb with his own thought to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance he lean upon his hand with his untasted breakfast before he and he stare at the slip of paper which he have just draw from its envelope then he take the envelope itself hold it up to the light and very carefully study both the exterior and the flap "it be porlock 's writing say he thoughtfully can hardly doubt that it be porlock 's writing though have see it only twice before the greek with the peculiar top flourish be distinctive but if it be porlock then it must be something of the very first importance "he be speak to himself rather than to i but my vexation disappear in the interest which the word awaken "who then be porlock ask "porlock watson be nom de plume mere identification mark but behind it lie shifty and evasive personality in former letter he frankly inform i that the name be not his own and defy i ever to trace he among the teem million of this great city porlock be important not for himself but for the great man with whom he be in touch picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark the jackal with the lion anything that be insignificant in companionship with what be formidable not only formidable watson but sinister in the high degree sinister that be where he come within my purview you have hear i speak of professor moriarty?""the famous scientific criminal as famous among crook as my blush watson holme murmur in deprecate voice "i be about to say as he be unknown to the public ""a touch distinct touch cry holmes you be develop certain unexpected vein of pawky humour watson against which must learn to guard myself but in call moriarty criminal you be utter libel in the eye of the law and there lie the glory and the wonder of it the great schemer of all time the organizer of every deviltry the control brain of the underworld brain which might have make or mar the destiny of nation that be the man but so aloof be he from general suspicion so immune from criticism so admirable in his management and self effacement that for those very word that you have utter he could hale you to court and emerge with your year 's pension as solatium for his wound character be he not the celebrated author of the dynamics of an asteroid book which ascend to such rarefied height of pure mathematic that it be say that there be no man in the scientific press capable of criticize it be this man to traduce foul mouthed doctor and slandered professor such would be your respective role that be genius watson but if be spare by less man our day will surely come ""may be there to see exclaim devoutly but you be speak of this man porlock ""ah yes the so call porlock be link in the chain some little way from its great attachment porlock be not quite sound link between ourselves he be the only flaw in that chain so far as have be able to test it ""but no chain be strong than its weak link ""exactly my dear watson hence the extreme importance of porlock lead on by some rudimentary aspiration towards right and encourage by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten pound note send to he by devious method he have once or twice give i advance information which have be of value that high value which anticipate and prevent rather than avenge crime can not doubt that if we have the cipher we should find that this communication be of the nature that indicate "again holmes flatten out the paper upon his unused plate rise and lean over he stare down at the curious inscription which run as follows:534 c2 13 127 36 31 17 21 41 douglas 109 293 37 birlstone 26 birlstone 47 171"what do you make of it holmes?""it be obviously an attempt to convey secret information ""but what be the use of cipher message without the cipher?""in this instance none at all ""why do you say in this instance'?""because there be many cipher which would read as easily as do the apocrypha of the agony column such crude device amuse the intelligence without fatigue it but this be different it be clearly reference to the word in page of some book until be tell which page and which book be powerless ""but why douglas and birlstone'?""clearly because those be word which be not contain in the page in question ""then why have he not indicate the book?""your native shrewdness my dear watson that innate cunning which be the delight of your friend would surely prevent you from inclose cipher and message in the same envelope should it miscarry you be undone as it be both have to go wrong before any harm come from it our second post be now overdue and shall be surprised if it do not bring we either further letter of explanation or as be more probable the very volume to which these figure refer "holme 's calculation be fulfil within very few minute by the appearance of billy the page with the very letter which we be expect "the same writing remark holmes as he open the envelope and actually sign he add in an exultant voice as he unfold the epistle come we be get on watson his brow cloud however as he glance over the content "dear i this be very disappointing fear watson that all our expectation come to nothing trust that the man porlock will come to no harm "dear mr holmes he says]:"i will go no far in this matter it be too dangerous he suspect i can see that he suspect i he come to i quite unexpectedly after have actually address this envelope with the intention of send you the key to the cipher be able to cover it up if he have see it it would have go hard with i but read suspicion in his eye please burn the cipher message which can now be of no use to you "fred porlock."holme sit for some little time twist this letter between his finger and frown as he stare into the fire "after all he say at last there may be nothing in it it may be only his guilty conscience know himself to be traitor he may have read the accusation in the other 's eye ""the other being presume professor moriarty ""no less when any of that party talk about he you know whom they mean there be one predominant he for all of they ""but what can he do?""hum that be large question when you have one of the first brain of europe up against you and all the power of darkness at his back there be infinite possibility anyhow friend porlock be evidently scare out of his sense kindly compare the writing in the note to that upon its envelope which be do he tell we before this ill omen visit the one be clear and firm the other hardly legible ""why do he write at all why do he not simply drop it?""because he fear would make some inquiry after he in that case and possibly bring trouble on he ""no doubt say i. of course have pick up the original cipher message and be bend my brow over it it be pretty madden to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper and that it be beyond human power to penetrate it "sherlock holmes have push away his untasted breakfast and light the unsavoury pipe which be the companion of his deep meditation wonder say he lean back and stare at the ceiling perhaps there be point which have escape your machiavellian intellect let we consider the problem in the light of pure reason this man 's reference be to book that be our point of departure ""a somewhat vague one ""let we see then if we can narrow it down as focus my mind upon it it seem rather less impenetrable what indication have we as to this book?""none ""well well it be surely not quite so bad as that the cipher message begin with large 534 do it not we may take it as work hypothesis that 534 be the particular page to which the cipher refer so our book have already become large book which be surely something gain what other indication have we as to the nature of this large book the next sign be c2 what do you make of that watson?""chapter the second no doubt ""hardly that watson you will be sure agree with i that if the page be give the number of the chapter be immaterial also that if page 534 find we only in the second chapter the length of the first one must have be really intolerable ""column cry "brilliant watson you be scintillate this morning if it be not column then be very much deceive so now you see we begin to visualize large book print in double column which be each of considerable length since one of the word be number in the document as the two hundred and ninety third have we reach the limit of what reason can supply?""i fear that we have ""surely you do yourself an injustice one more coruscation my dear watson yet another brain wave have the volume be an unusual one he would have send it to i instead of that he have intend before his plan be nip to send i the clue in this envelope he say so in his note this would seem to indicate that the book be one which he think would have no difficulty in find for myself he have it and he imagine that would have it too in short watson it be very common book ""what you say certainly sound plausible ""so we have contract our field of search to large book print in double column and in common use ""the bible cry triumphantly "good watson good but not if may say so quite good enough even if accept the compliment for myself could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of moriarty 's associate besides the edition of holy writ be so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copy would have the same pagination this be clearly book which be standardized he know for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534.""but very few book would correspond with that ""exactly therein lie our salvation our search be narrow down to standardized book which anyone may be suppose to possess ""bradshaw!""there be difficulty watson the vocabulary of bradshaw be nervous and terse but limited the selection of word would hardly lend itself to the sending of general message we will eliminate bradshaw the dictionary be fear inadmissible for the same reason what then be left?""an almanac!""excellent watson be very much mistaken if you have not touch the spot an almanac let we consider the claim of whitaker 's almanac it be in common use it have the requisite number of page it be in double column though reserve in its early vocabulary it become if remember right quite garrulous towards the end he pick the volume from his desk here be page 534 column two substantial block of print dealing perceive with the trade and resource of british india jot down the word watson number thirteen be mahratta not fear very auspicious beginning number one hundred and twenty seven be government which at least make sense though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and professor moriarty now let we try again what do the mahratta government do alas the next word be pig's bristle we be undone my good watson it be finished!"he have speak in jest vein but the twitching of his bushy eyebrow bespoke his disappointment and irritation sit helpless and unhappy stare into the fire long silence be break by sudden exclamation from holmes who dash at cupboard from which he emerge with second yellow cover volume in his hand "we pay the price watson for be too up to date he cry we be before our time and suffer the usual penalty be the seventh of january we have very properly lay in the new almanac it be more than likely that porlock take his message from the old one no doubt he would have tell we so have his letter of explanation be write now let we see what page 534 have in store for we number thirteen be there which be much more promising number one hundred and twenty seven be be there be holmes 's eye be gleam with excitement and his thin nervous finger twitch as he count the word danger ha ha capital put that down watson there be danger may come very soon one then we have the name douglas rich country now at birlstone house birlstone confidence be press there watson what do you think of pure reason and its fruit if the green grocer have such thing as laurel wreath should send billy round for it "i be stare at the strange message which have scrawl as he decipher it upon sheet of foolscap on my knee "what queer scramble way of express his meaning say i."on the contrary he have do quite remarkably well say holmes when you search single column for word with which to express your meaning you can hardly expect to get everything you want you be bind to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent the purport be perfectly clear some deviltry be intend against one douglas whoever he may be reside as state rich country gentleman he be sure confidence be as near as he could get to confident that it be press there be our result and very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was!"holme have the impersonal joy of the true artist in his well work even as he mourn darkly when it fall below the high level to which he aspire he be still chuckle over his success when billy swing open the door and inspector macdonald of scotland yard be usher into the room those be the early day at the end of the 80 ' when alec macdonald be far from having attain the national fame which he have now achieve he be young but trusted member of the detective force who have distinguish himself in several case which have be intrust to he his tall bony figure give promise of exceptional physical strength while his great cranium and deep set lustrous eye speak no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkle out from behind his bushy eyebrow he be silent precise man with dour nature and hard aberdonian accent twice already in his career have holmes help he to attain success his own sole reward be the intellectual joy of the problem for this reason the affection and respect of the scotchman for his amateur colleague be profound and he show they by the frankness with which he consult holmes in every difficulty mediocrity know nothing high than itself but talent instantly recognize genius and macdonald have talent enough for his profession to enable he to perceive that there be no humiliation in seek the assistance of one who already stand alone in europe both in his gift and in his experience holmes be not prone to friendship but he be tolerant of the big scotchman and smile at the sight of he "you be an early bird mr. mac say he wish you luck with your worm fear this mean that there be some mischief afoot ""if you say hope instead of fear it would be nearer the truth be think mr. holmes the inspector answer with know grin well maybe wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill no wo n't smoke thank you 'll have to be push on my way for the early hour of case be the precious one as no man know well than your own self but but the inspector have stop suddenly and be stare with look of absolute amazement at paper upon the table it be the sheet upon which have scrawl the enigmatic message "douglas he stammer birlstone what be this mr. holmes man it be witchcraft where in the name of all that be wonderful do you get those names?""it be cipher that dr. watson and have have occasion to solve but why what be amiss with the names?"the inspector look from one to the other of we in daze astonishment just this say he that mr. douglas of birlstone manor house be horribly murder last night!"it be one of those dramatic moment for which my friend exist it would be an overstatement to say that he be shocked or even excite by the amazing announcement without have tinge of cruelty in his singular composition he be undoubtedly callous from long overstimulation yet if his emotion be dull his intellectual perception be exceedingly active there be no trace then of the horror which have myself feel at this curt declaration but his face show rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who see the crystal fall into position from his oversaturated solution "remarkable say he remarkable!""you do n't seem surprised ""interested mr. mac but hardly surprised why should be surprised receive an anonymous communication from quarter which know to be important warn i that danger threaten certain person within an hour learn that this danger have actually materialize and that the person be dead be interested but as you observe be not surprised "in few short sentence he explain to the inspector the fact about the letter and the cipher macdonald sit with his chin on his hand and his great sandy eyebrow bunch into yellow tangle "i be go down to birlstone this morning say he have come to ask you if you care to come with i you and your friend here but from what you say we might perhaps be do well work in london ""i rather think not say holmes "hang it all mr. holmes cry the inspector the paper will be full of the birlstone mystery in day or two but where be the mystery if there be man in london who prophesy the crime before ever it occur we have only to lay our hand on that man and the rest will follow ""no doubt mr. mac but how do you propose to lay your hand on the so call porlock?"macdonald turn over the letter which holmes have hand he post in camberwell that do n't help we much name you say be assume not much to go on certainly do n't you say that you have send he money?""twice ""and how?""in note to camberwell post office ""did you ever trouble to see who call for them?""no "the inspector look surprised and little shocked why not?""because always keep faith have promise when he first write that would not try to trace he ""you think there be someone behind him?""i know there be ""this professor that 've hear you mention?""exactly!"inspector macdonald smile and his eyelid quiver as he glance towards i wo n't conceal from you mr. holmes that we think in the c.i.d. that you have wee bit of bee in your bonnet over this professor make some inquiry myself about the matter he seem to be very respectable learn and talented sort of man ""i'm glad you 've get so far as to recognize the talent ""man you ca n't but recognize it after hear your view make it my business to see he have chat with he on eclipse how the talk get that way canna think but he have out reflector lantern and globe and make it all clear in minute he lend i book but do n't mind say that it be bit above my head though have good aberdeen upbringing he 'd have make grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair and solemn like way of talk when he put his hand on my shoulder as we be part it be like father 's blessing before you go out into the cold cruel world "holme chuckle and rub his hand great he say great tell i friend macdonald this pleasing and touching interview be suppose in the professor 's study?""that be so ""a fine room be it not?""very fine very handsome indeed mr. holmes ""you sit in front of his writing desk?""just so ""sun in your eye and his face in the shadow?""well it be evening but mind that the lamp be turn on my face ""it would be do you happen to observe picture over the professor 's head?""i do n't miss much mr. holmes maybe learn that from you yes see the picture young woman with her head on her hand peep at you sideways ""that painting be by jean baptiste greuze "the inspector endeavour to look interested "jean baptiste greuze holme continue join his finger tip and lean well back in his chair be french artist who flourish between the year 1750 and 1800 allude of course to his working career modern criticism have more than indorse the high opinion form of he by his contemporary "the inspector 's eye grow abstracted had n't we well he say "we be do so holme interrupt all that be say have very direct and vital bearing upon what you have call the birlstone mystery in fact it may in sense be call the very centre of it "macdonald smile feebly and look appealingly to i your thought move bit too quick for i mr. holmes you leave out link or two and ca n't get over the gap what in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead paint man and the affair at birlstone?""all knowledge come useful to the detective remark holmes even the trivial fact that in the year 1865 picture by greuze entitle la jeune fille l'agneau fetch one million two hundred thousand franc more than forty thousand pound at the portalis sale may start train of reflection in your mind "it be clear that it do the inspector look honestly interested "i may remind you holme continue that the professor 's salary can be ascertain in several trustworthy book of reference it be seven hundred year ""then how could he buy quite so how could he?""ay that be remarkable say the inspector thoughtfully talk away mr. holmes be just love it it be fine!"holme smile he be always warm by genuine admiration the characteristic of the real artist what about birlstone he ask "we've time yet say the inspector glance at his watch 've cab at the door and it wo n't take we twenty minute to victoria but about this picture think you tell i once mr. holmes that you have never meet professor moriarty ""no never have ""then how do you know about his rooms?""ah that be another matter have be three time in his room twice wait for he under different pretext and leave before he come once well can hardly tell about the once to an official detective it be on the last occasion that take the liberty of run over his paper with the most unexpected result ""you find something compromising?""absolutely nothing that be what amaze i however you have now see the point of the picture it show he to be very wealthy man how do he acquire wealth he be unmarried his young brother be station master in the west of england his chair be worth seven hundred year and he own greuze ""well?""surely the
