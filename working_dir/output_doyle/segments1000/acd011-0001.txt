towards the centre of the web where the poisonous motionless creature be lurk only mention the greuze because it bring the matter within the range of your own observation ""well mr. holmes admit that what you say be interesting it be more than interesting it be just wonderful but let we have it little clear if you can be it forgery coining burglary where do the money come from?""have you ever read of jonathan wild?""well the name have familiar sound someone in novel be he not do n't take much stock of detective in novel chap that do thing and never let you see how they do they that be just inspiration not business ""jonathan wild be n't detective and he be n't in novel he be master criminal and he live last century 1750 or thereabout ""then he be no use to i be practical man ""mr mac the most practical thing that you ever do in your life would be to shut yourself up for three month and read twelve hour day at the annal of crime everything come in circle even professor moriarty jonathan wild be the hidden force of the london criminal to whom he sell his brain and his organization on fifteen per cent commission the old wheel turn and the same speak come up it be all be do before and will be again 'll tell you one or two thing about moriarty which may interest you ""you'll interest i right enough ""i happen to know who be the first link in his chain chain with this napoleon go wrong at one end and hundred broken fight man pickpocket blackmailer and card sharper at the other with every sort of crime in between his chief of staff be colonel sebastian moran as aloof and guard and inaccessible to the law as himself what do you think he pay him?""i'd like to hear ""six thousand year that be pay for brain you see the american business principle learn that detail quite by chance it be more than the prime minister get that give you an idea of moriarty 's gain and of the scale on which he work another point make it my business to hunt down some of moriarty 's check lately just common innocent check that he pay his household bill with they be draw on six different bank do that make any impression on your mind?""queer certainly but what do you gather from it?""that he want no gossip about his wealth no single man should know what he have have no doubt that he have twenty banking account the bulk of his fortune abroad in the deutsche bank or the credit lyonnais as likely as not sometime when you have year or two to spare commend to you the study of professor moriarty "inspector macdonald have grow steadily more impressed as the conversation proceed he have lose himself in his interest now his practical scotch intelligence bring he back with snap to the matter in hand "he can keep anyhow say he you 've get we side track with your interesting anecdote mr. holmes what really count be your remark that there be some connection between the professor and the crime that you get from the warning receive through the man porlock can we for our present practical need get any far than that?""we may form some conception as to the motive of the crime it be as gather from your original remark an inexplicable or at least an unexplained murder now presume that the source of the crime be as we suspect it to be there might be two different motive in the first place may tell you that moriarty rule with rod of iron over his people his discipline be tremendous there be only one punishment in his code it be death now we might suppose that this murder man this douglas whose approach fate be know by one of the arch criminal 's subordinate have in some way betray the chief his punishment follow and would be know to all if only to put the fear of death into they ""well that be one suggestion mr. holmes ""the other be that it have be engineer by moriarty in the ordinary course of business be there any robbery?""i have not hear ""if so it would of course be against the first hypothesis and in favour of the second moriarty may have be engage to engineer it on promise of part spoil or he may have be pay so much down to manage it either be possible but whichever it may be or if it be some third combination it be down at birlstone that we must seek the solution know our man too well to suppose that he have leave anything up here which may lead we to he ""then to birlstone we must go cry macdonald jump from his chair my word it be later than think can give you gentleman five minute for preparation and that be all ""and ample for we both say holmes as he spring up and hasten to change from his dressing gown to his coat while we be on our way mr. mac will ask you to be good enough to tell i all about it ""all about it prove to be disappointingly little and yet there be enough to assure we that the case before we might well be worthy of the expert 's close attention he brighten and rub his thin hand together as he listen to the meagre but remarkable detail long series of sterile week lie behind we and here at last there be fitting object for those remarkable power which like all special gift become irksome to their owner when they be not in use that razor brain blunt and rust with inaction sherlock holmes 's eye glisten his pale cheek take warm hue and his whole eager face shine with an inward light when the call for work reach he lean forward in the cab he listen intently to macdonald 's short sketch of the problem which await we in sussex the inspector be himself dependent as he explain to we upon scribble account forward to he by the milk train in the early hour of the morning white mason the local officer be personal friend and hence macdonald have be notify much more promptly than be usual at scotland yard when provincial need their assistance it be very cold scent upon which the metropolitan expert be generally ask to run "dear inspector macdonald say the letter which he read to us]:"official requisition for your service be in separate envelope this be for your private eye wire i what train in the morning you can get for birlstone and will meet it or have it meet if be too occupied this case be snorter do n't waste moment in getting start if you can bring mr. holmes please do so for he will find something after his own heart we would think the whole have be fix up for theatrical effect if there be n't dead man in the middle of it my word it be snorter ""your friend seem to be no fool remark holmes "no sir white mason be very live man if be any judge ""well have you anything more?""only that he will give we every detail when we meet ""then how do you get at mr. douglas and the fact that he have be horribly murdered?""that be in the inclosed official report it do n't say horrible that be not recognize official term it give the name john douglas it mention that his injury have be in the head from the discharge of shotgun it also mention the hour of the alarm which be close on to midnight last night it add that the case be undoubtedly one of murder but that no arrest have be make and that the case be one which present some very perplexing and extraordinary feature that be absolutely all we have at present mr. holmes ""then with your permission we will leave it at that mr. mac the temptation to form premature theory upon insufficient datum be the bane of our profession can see only two thing for certain at present great brain in london and dead man in sussex it be the chain between that we be go to trace "now for moment will ask leave to remove my own insignificant personality and to describe event which occur before we arrive upon the scene by the light of knowledge which come to we afterwards only in this way can make the reader appreciate the people concern and the strange setting in which their fate be cast the village of birlstone be small and very ancient cluster of half timbere cottage on the northern border of the county of sussex for century it have remain unchanged but within the last few year its picturesque appearance and situation have attract number of well to do resident whose villa peep out from the wood around these wood be locally suppose to be the extreme fringe of the great weald forest which thin away until it reach the northern chalk down number of small shop have come into be to meet the want of the increase population so there seem some prospect that birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into modern town it be the centre for considerable area of country since tunbridge wells the near place of importance be ten or twelve mile to the eastward over the border of kent about half mile from the town stand in an old park famous for its huge beech tree be the ancient manor house of birlstone part of this venerable building date back to the time of the first crusade when hugo de capus build fortalice in the centre of the estate which have be grant to he by the red king this be destroy by fire in 1543 and some of its smoke blacken corner stone be use when in jacobean time brick country house rise upon the ruin of the feudal castle the manor house with its many gable and its small diamond pan window be still much as the builder have leave it in the early seventeenth century of the double moat which have guard its more warlike predecessor the outer have be allow to dry up and serve the humble function of kitchen garden the inner one be still there and lie forty foot in breadth though now only few foot in depth round the whole house small stream feed it and continue beyond it so that the sheet of water though turbid be never ditchlike or unhealthy the ground floor window be within foot of the surface of the water the only approach to the house be over drawbridge the chain and windlass of which have long be rust and break the late tenant of the manor house have however with characteristic energy set this right and the drawbridge be not only capable of be raise but actually be raise every evening and lower every morning by thus renew the custom of the old feudal day the manor house be convert into an island during the night fact which have very direct bearing upon the mystery which be soon to engage the attention of all england the house have be untenante for some year and be threaten to moulder into picturesque decay when the douglases take possession of it this family consist of only two individual john douglas and his wife douglas be remarkable man both in character and in person in age he may have be about fifty with strong jaw rugged face grizzle moustache peculiarly keen gray eye and wiry vigorous figure which have lose nothing of the strength and activity of youth he be cheery and genial to all but somewhat offhand in his manner give the impression that he have see life in social strata on some far low horizon than the county society of sussex yet though look at with some curiosity and reserve by his more cultivated neighbour he soon acquire great popularity among the villager subscribe handsomely to all local object and attend their smoking concert and other function where have remarkably rich tenor voice he be always ready to oblige with an excellent song he appear to have plenty of money which be say to have be gain in the california gold field and it be clear from his own talk and that of his wife that he have spend part of his life in america the good impression which have be produce by his generosity and by his democratic manner be increase by reputation gain for utter indifference to danger though wretched rider he turn out at every meet and take the most amazing fall in his determination to hold his own with the good when the vicarage catch fire he distinguish himself also by the fearlessness with which he reentere the building to save property after the local fire brigade have give it up as impossible thus it come about that john douglas of the manor house have within five year win himself quite reputation in birlstone his wife too be popular with those who have make her acquaintance though after the english fashion the caller upon stranger who settle in the county without introduction be few and far between this matter the less to she as she be retire by disposition and very much absorb to all appearance in her husband and her domestic duty it be know that she be an english lady who have meet mr. douglas in london he be at that time widower she be beautiful woman tall dark and slender some twenty year young than her husband disparity which seem in no wise to mar the contentment of their family life it be remark sometimes however by those who know they well that the confidence between the two do not appear to be complete since the wife be either very reticent about her husband 's past life or else as seem more likely be imperfectly inform about it it have also be note and comment upon by few observant people that there be sign sometimes of some nerve strain upon the part of mrs. douglas and that she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should ever be particularly late in his return on quiet countryside where all gossip be welcome this weakness of the lady of the manor house do not pass without remark and it bulk large upon people 's memory when the event arise which give it very special significance there be yet another individual whose residence under that roof be it be true only an intermittent one but whose presence at the time of the strange happening which will now be narrate bring his name prominently before the public this be cecil james barker of hales lodge hampstead cecil barker 's tall loose jointed figure be familiar one in the main street of birlstone village for he be frequent and welcome visitor at the manor house he be the more noticed as be the only friend of the past unknown life of mr. douglas who be ever see in his new english surrounding barker be himself an undoubted englishman but by his remark it be clear that he have first know douglas in america and have there live on intimate term with he he appear to be man of considerable wealth and be repute to be bachelor in age he be rather young than douglas forty five at the most tall straight broad cheste fellow with clean shave prize fighter face thick strong black eyebrow and pair of masterful black eye which might even without the aid of his very capable hand clear way for he through hostile crowd he neither ride nor shoot but spend his day in wander round the old village with his pipe in his mouth or in drive with his host or in his absence with his hostess over the beautiful countryside an easy go free handed gentleman say ames the butler but my word have rather not be the man that cross he he be cordial and intimate with douglas and he be no less friendly with his wife friendship which more than once seem to cause some irritation to the husband so that even the servant be able to perceive his annoyance such be the third person who be one of the family when the catastrophe occur as to the other denizen of the old building it will suffice out of large household to mention the prim respectable and capable ames and mrs. allen buxom and cheerful person who relieve the lady of some of her household care the other six servant in the house bear no relation to the event of the night of january 6th it be at eleven forty five that the first alarm reach the small local police station in charge of sergeant wilson of the sussex constabulary cecil barker much excited have rush up to the door and peal furiously upon the bell terrible tragedy have occur at the manor house and john douglas have be murder that be the breathless burden of his message he have hurry back to the house follow within few minute by the police sergeant who arrive at the scene of the crime little after twelve o'clock after take prompt step to warn the county authority that something serious be afoot on reach the manor house the sergeant have find the drawbridge down the window light up and the whole household in state of wild confusion and alarm the white face servant be huddle together in the hall with the frightened butler wring his hand in the doorway only cecil barker seem to be master of himself and his emotion he have open the door which be nearest to the entrance and he have beckon to the sergeant to follow he at that moment there arrive dr. wood brisk and capable general practitioner from the village the three man enter the fatal room together while the horror stricken butler follow at their heel close the door behind he to shut out the terrible scene from the maid servant the dead man lie on his back sprawl with outstretched limb in the centre of the room he be clothe only in pink dressing gown which cover his night clothe there be carpet slipper on his bare foot the doctor kneel beside he and hold down the hand lamp which have stand on the table one glance at the victim be enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispense with the man have be horribly injure lie across his chest be curious weapon shotgun with the barrel saw off foot in front of the trigger it be clear that this have be fire at close range and that he have receive the whole charge in the face blow his head almost to piece the trigger have be wire together so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive the country policeman be unnerve and trouble by the tremendous responsibility which have come so suddenly upon he we will touch nothing until my superior arrive he say in hushed voice stare in horror at the dreadful head "nothing have be touch up to now say cecil barker 'll answer for that you see it all exactly as find it ""when be that the sergeant have draw out his notebook "it be just half past eleven have not begin to undress and be sit by the fire in my bedroom when hear the report it be not very loud it seem to be muffle rush down do n't suppose it be thirty second before be in the room ""was the door open?""yes it be open poor douglas be lie as you see he his bedroom candle be burn on the table it be who light the lamp some minute afterward ""did you see no one?""no hear mrs. douglas come down the stair behind i and rush out to prevent she from see this dreadful sight mrs. allen the housekeeper come and take she away ame have arrive and we run back into the room once more ""but surely have hear that the drawbridge be keep up all night ""yes it be up until lower it ""then how could any murderer have get away it be out of the question mr. douglas must have shoot himself ""that be our first idea but see barker draw aside the curtain and show that the long diamond pan window be open to its full extent and look at this he hold the lamp down and illuminate smudge of blood like the mark of boot sole upon the wooden sill someone have stand there in get out ""you mean that someone wade across the moat?""exactly!""then if you be in the room within half minute of the crime he must have be in the water at that very moment ""i have not doubt of it wish to heaven that have rush to the window but the curtain screen it as you can see and so it never occur to i then hear the step of mrs. douglas and could not let she enter the room it would have be too horrible ""horrible enough say the doctor look at the shattered head and the terrible mark which surround it 've never see such injury since the birlstone railway smash ""but say remark the police sergeant whose slow bucolic common sense be still ponder the open window it be all very well your say that man escape by wade this moat but what ask you be how do he ever get into the house at all if the bridge be up?""ah that be the question say barker "at what o'clock be it raised?""it be nearly six o'clock say ames the butler "i've hear say the sergeant that it be usually raise at sunset that would be near half past four than six at this time of year ""mrs douglas have visitor to tea say ames could n't raise it until they go then wind it up myself ""then it come to this say the sergeant if anyone come from outside if they do they must have get in across the bridge before six and be in hiding ever since until mr. douglas come into the room after eleven ""that be so mr. douglas go round the house every night the last thing before he turn in to see that the light be right that bring he in here the man be wait and shoot he then he get away through the window and leave his gun behind he that be how read it for nothing else will fit the fact "the sergeant pick up card which lie beside the dead man on the floor the initial v.v. and under they the number 341 be rudely scrawl in ink upon it "what be this he ask hold it up barker look at it with curiosity never notice it before he say the murderer must have leave it behind he ""v.v. 341 can make no sense of that "the sergeant keep turn it over in his big finger what be v.v. somebody 's initial maybe what have you get there dr. wood?"it be good sized hammer which have be lie on the rug in front of the fireplace substantial workmanlike hammer cecil barker point to box of brass head nail upon the mantelpiece "mr douglas be alter the picture yesterday he say see he myself stand upon that chair and fix the big picture above it that account for the hammer ""we'd good put it back on the rug where we find it say the sergeant scratch his puzzled head in his perplexity it will want the good brain in the force to get to the bottom of this thing it will be london job before it be finish he raise the hand lamp and walk slowly round the room hullo he cry excitedly draw the window curtain to one side what o'clock be those curtain drawn?""when the lamp be light say the butler it would be shortly after four ""someone have be hide here sure enough he hold down the light and the mark of muddy boot be very visible in the corner be bind to say this bear out your theory mr. barker it look as if the man get into the house after four when the curtain be draw and before six when the bridge be raise he slip into this room because it be the first that he see there be no other place where he could hide so he pop in behind this curtain that all seem clear enough it be likely that his main idea be to burgle the house but mr. douglas chance to come upon he so he murder he and
