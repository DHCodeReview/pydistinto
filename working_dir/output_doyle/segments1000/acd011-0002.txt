escape ""that be how read it say barker but say be n't we waste precious time could n't we start out and scout the country before the fellow get away?"the sergeant consider for moment "there be no train before six in the morning so he ca n't get away by rail if he go by road with his leg all dripping it be odd that someone will notice he anyhow ca n't leave here myself until be relieved but think none of you should go until we see more clearly how we all stand "the doctor have take the lamp and be narrowly scrutinize the body what be this mark he ask could this have any connection with the crime?"the dead man 's right arm be thrust out from his dressing gown and expose as high as the elbow about halfway up the forearm be curious brown design triangle inside circle stand out in vivid relief upon the lard colour skin "it be not tattoo say the doctor peer through his glass never see anything like it the man have be brand at some time as they brand cattle what be the meaning of this?""i do n't profess to know the meaning of it say cecil barker but have see the mark on douglas many time this last ten year ""and so have say the butler many time when the master have roll up his sleeve have notice that very mark 've often wonder what it could be ""then it have nothing to do with the crime anyhow say the sergeant but it be rum thing all the same everything about this case be rum well what be it now?"the butler have give an exclamation of astonishment and be point at the dead man 's outstretche hand "they've take his wedding ring he gasp "what!""yes indeed master always wear his plain gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left hand that ring with the rough nugget on it be above it and the twisted snake ring on the third finger there be the nugget and there be the snake but the wedding ring be go ""he be right say barker "do you tell i say the sergeant that the wedding ring be below the other?""always!""then the murderer or whoever it be first take off this ring you call the nugget ring then the wedding ring and afterwards put the nugget ring back again ""that be so!"the worthy country policeman shake his head seem to i the soon we get london on to this case the well say he white mason be smart man no local job have ever be too much for white mason it wo n't be long now before he be here to help we but expect we 'll have to look to london before we be through anyhow be not ashamed to say that it be deal too thick for the like of i "at three in the morning the chief sussex detective obey the urgent call from sergeant wilson of birlstone arrive from headquarters in light dog cart behind breathless trotter by the five forty train in the morning he have send his message to scotland yard and he be at the birlstone station at twelve o'clock to welcome we white mason be quiet comfortable look person in loose tweed suit with clean shave ruddy face stoutish body and powerful bandy leg adorn with gaiter look like small farmer retire gamekeeper or anything upon earth except very favourable speciman of the provincial criminal officer "a real downright snorter mr. macdonald he keep repeat we 'll have the pressman down like fly when they understand it be hope we will get our work do before they get poke their nose into it and mess up all the trail there have be nothing like this that can remember there be some bit that will come home to you mr. holmes or be mistaken and you also dr. watson for the medico will have word to say before we finish your room be at the westville arms there be no other place but hear that it be clean and good the man will carry your bag this way gentleman if you please "he be very bustling and genial person this sussex detective in ten minute we have all find our quarter in ten more we be seat in the parlour of the inn and be treat to rapid sketch of those event which have be outline in the previous chapter macdonald make an occasional note while holme sat absorb with the expression of surprised and reverent admiration with which the botanist survey the rare and precious bloom "remarkable he say when the story be unfold most remarkable can hardly recall any case where the feature have be more peculiar ""i think you would say so mr. holmes say white mason in great delight we be well up with the time in sussex 've tell you now how matter be up to the time when take over from sergeant wilson between three and four this morning my word make the old mare go but need not have be in such hurry as it turn out for there be nothing immediate that could do sergeant wilson have all the fact check they and consider they and maybe add few of my own ""what be they ask holmes eagerly "well first have the hammer examine there be dr. wood there to help i we find no sign of violence upon it be hope that if mr. douglas defend himself with the hammer he might have leave his mark upon the murderer before he drop it on the mat but there be no stain ""that of course prove nothing at all remark inspector macdonald there have be many hammer murder and no trace on the hammer ""quite so it do n't prove it be n't use but there might have be stain and that would have help we as matter of fact there be none then examine the gun they be buckshot cartridge and as sergeant wilson point out the trigger be wire together so that if you pull on the hinder one both barrel be discharge whoever fix that up have make up his mind that he be go to take no chance of miss his man the sawed gun be not more than two foot long one could carry it easily under one 's coat there be no complete maker 's name but the print letter be on the fluting between the barrel and the rest of the name have be cut off by the saw ""a big with flourish above it and small ask holmes "exactly ""pennsylvania small arms company well know american firm say holmes white mason gaze at my friend as the little village practitioner look at the harley street specialist who by word can solve the difficulty that perplex he "that be very helpful mr. holmes no doubt you be right wonderful wonderful do you carry the name of all the gun maker in the world in your memory?"holme dismiss the subject with wave "no doubt it be an american shotgun white mason continue seem to have read that saw off shotgun be weapon use in some part of america apart from the name upon the barrel the idea have occur to i there be some evidence then that this man who enter the house and kill its master be an american "macdonald shake his head man you be surely travel overfast say he have hear no evidence yet that any stranger be ever in the house at all ""the open window the blood on the sill the queer card the mark of boot in the corner the gun!""nothing there that could not have be arrange mr. douglas be an american or have live long in america so have mr. barker you do n't need to import an american from outside in order to account for american doing ""ames the butler what about he be he reliable?""ten year with sir charles chandos as solid as rock he have be with douglas ever since he take the manor house five year ago he have never see gun of this sort in the house ""the gun be make to conceal that be why the barrel be saw it would fit into any box how could he swear there be no such gun in the house?""well anyhow he have never see one "macdonald shake his obstinate scotch head be not convince yet that there be ever anyone in the house say he be ask you to conseedar his accent become more aberdonian as he lose himself in his argument be ask you to conseedar what it involve if you suppose that this gun be ever bring into the house and that all these strange thing be do by person from outside oh man it be just inconceivable it be clean against common sense put it to you mr. holmes judge it by what we have hear ""well state your case mr. mac say holmes in his most judicial style "the man be not burglar suppose that he ever exist the ring business and the card point to premeditate murder for some private reason very good here be man who slip into house with the deliberate intention of commit murder he know if he know anything that he will have deeficulty in make his escape as the house be surround with water what weapon would he choose you would say the most silent in the world then he could hope when the deed be do to slip quickly from the window to wade the moat and to get away at his leisure that be understandable but be it understandable that he should go out of his way to bring with he the most noisy weapon he could select know well that it will fetch every human being in the house to the spot as quick as they can run and that it be all odd that he will be see before he can get across the moat be that credible mr. holmes?""well you put the case strongly my friend reply thoughtfully it certainly need good deal of justification may ask mr. white mason whether you examine the farther side of the moat at once to see if there be any sign of the man having climb out from the water?""there be no sign mr. holmes but it be stone ledge and one could hardly expect they ""no track or marks?""none ""ha would there be any objection mr. white mason to our go down to the house at once there may possibly be some small point which might be suggestive ""i be go to propose it mr. holmes but think it well to put you in touch with all the fact before we go suppose if anything should strike you white mason look doubtfully at the amateur "i have work with mr. holmes before say inspector macdonald he play the game ""my own idea of the game at any rate say holmes with smile go into case to help the end of justice and the work of the police if have ever separate myself from the official force it be because they have first separate themselves from i have no wish ever to score at their expense at the same time mr. white mason claim the right to work in my own way and give my result at my own time complete rather than in stage ""i be sure we be honour by your presence and to show you all we know say white mason cordially come along dr. watson and when the time come we 'll all hope for place in your book "we walk down the quaint village street with row of pollard elm on each side of it just beyond be two ancient stone pillar weather stain and lichen blotch bear upon their summit shapeless something which have once be the rampant lion of capus of birlstone short walk along the winding drive with such sward and oak around it as one only see in rural england then sudden turn and the long low jacobean house of dingy liver colour brick lie before we with an old fashioned garden of cut yew on each side of it as we approach it there be the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold winter sunshine three century have flow past the old manor house century of birth and of homecoming of country dance and of the meeting of fox hunter strange that now in its old age this dark business should have cast its shadow upon the venerable wall and yet those strange peaked roof and quaint overhung gable be fitting covering to grim and terrible intrigue as look at the deep set window and the long sweep of the dull coloured water lap front feel that no more fitting scene could be set for such tragedy "that be the window say white mason that one on the immediate right of the drawbridge it be open just as it be find last night ""it look rather narrow for man to pass ""well it be n't fat man anyhow we do n't need your deduction mr. holmes to tell we that but you or could squeeze through all right "holme walk to the edge of the moat and look across then he examine the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it "i've have good look mr. holmes say white mason there be nothing there no sign that anyone have land but why should he leave any sign?""exactly why should he be the water always turbid?""generally about this colour the stream bring down the clay ""how deep be it?""about two foot at each side and three in the middle ""so we can put aside all idea of the man having be drown in crossing ""no child could not be drown in it "we walk across the drawbridge and be admit by quaint gnarl dry up person who be the butler ames the poor old fellow be white and quiver from the shock the village sergeant tall formal melancholy man still hold his vigil in the room of fate the doctor have depart "anything fresh sergeant wilson ask white mason "no sir ""then you can go home you 've have enough we can send for you if we want you the butler have well wait outside tell he to warn mr. cecil barker mrs. douglas and the housekeeper that we may want word with they presently now gentleman perhaps you will allow i to give you the view have form first and then you will be able to arrive at your own "he impress i this country specialist he have solid grip of fact and cool clear common sense brain which should take he some way in his profession holme listen to he intently with no sign of that impatience which the official exponent too often produce "is it suicide or be it murder that be our first question gentleman be it not if it be suicide then we have to believe that this man begin by take off his wedding ring and conceal it that he then come down here in his dressing gown trample mud into corner behind the curtain in order to give the idea someone have wait for he open the window put blood on the we can surely dismiss that say macdonald "so think suicide be out of the question then murder have be do what we have to determine be whether it be do by someone outside or inside the house ""well let 's hear the argument ""there be considerable difficulty both way and yet one or the other it must be we will suppose first that some person or person inside the house do the crime they get this man down here at time when everything be still and yet no one be asleep they then do the deed with the queer and noisy weapon in the world so as to tell everyone what have happen weapon that be never see in the house before that do not seem very likely start do it?""no it do not ""well then everyone be agree that after the alarm be give only minute at the most have pass before the whole household not mr. cecil barker alone though he claim to have be the first but ames and all of they be on the spot do you tell i that in that time the guilty person manage to make footmark in the corner open the window mark the sill with blood take the wedding ring off the dead man 's finger and all the rest of it it be impossible!""you put it very clearly say holmes be inclined to agree with you ""well then we be drive back to the theory that it be do by someone from outside we be still face with some big difficulty but anyhow they have cease to be impossibility the man get into the house between four thirty and six that be to say between dusk and the time when the bridge be raise there have be some visitor and the door be open so there be nothing to prevent he he may have be common burglar or he may have have some private grudge against mr. douglas since mr. douglas have spend most of his life in america and this shotgun seem to be an american weapon it would seem that the private grudge be the more likely theory he slip into this room because it be the first he come to and he hide behind the curtain there he remain until past eleven at night at that time mr. douglas enter the room it be short interview if there be any interview at all for mrs. douglas declare that her husband have not leave she more than few minute when she hear the shot ""the candle show that say holmes "exactly the candle which be new one be not burn more than half an inch he must have place it on the table before he be attack otherwise of course it would have fall when he fall this show that he be not attack the instant that he enter the room when mr. barker arrive the candle be light and the lamp be out ""that be all clear enough ""well now we can reconstruct thing on those line mr. douglas enter the room he put down the candle man appear from behind the curtain he be armed with this gun he demand the wedding ring heaven only know why but so it must have be mr. douglas give it up then either in cold blood or in the course of struggle douglas may have grip the hammer that be find upon the mat he shoot douglas in this horrible way he drop his gun and also it would seem this queer card v.v. 341 whatever that may mean and he make his escape through the window and across the moat at the very moment when cecil barker be discover the crime how be that mr. holmes?""very interesting but just little unconvincing ""man it would be absolute nonsense if it be n't that anything else be even bad cry macdonald somebody kill the man and whoever it be could clearly prove to you that he should have do it some other way what do he mean by allow his retreat to be cut off like that what do he mean by use shotgun when silence be his one chance of escape come mr. holmes it be up to you to give we lead since you say mr. white mason 's theory be unconvincing "holme have sit intently observant during this long discussion miss no word that be say with his keen eye dart to right and to left and his forehead wrinkle with speculation "i should like few more fact before get so far as theory mr. mac say he kneel down beside the body dear i these injury be really appalling can we have the butler in for moment ... ame understand that you have often see this very unusual mark brand triangle inside circle upon mr. douglas 's forearm?""frequently sir ""you never hear any speculation as to what it meant?""no sir ""it must have cause great pain when it be inflict it be undoubtedly burn now observe ames that there be small piece of plaster at the angle of mr. douglas 's jaw do you observe that in life?""yes sir he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning ""did you ever know he to cut himself in shaving before?""not for very long time sir ""suggestive say holmes it may of course be mere coincidence or it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he have reason to apprehend danger have you notice anything unusual in his conduct yesterday ames?""it strike i that he be little restless and excited sir ""ha the attack may not have be entirely unexpected we do seem to make little progress do we not perhaps you would rather do the questioning mr. mac?""no mr. holmes it be in well hand than mine ""well then we will pass to this card v.v. 341 it be rough cardboard have you any of the sort in the house?""i do n't think so "holme walk across to the desk and dab little ink from each bottle on to the blot paper it be not print in this room he say this be black ink and the other purplish it be do by thick pen and these be fine no it be do elsewhere should say can you make anything of the inscription ames?""no sir nothing ""what do you think mr. mac?""it give i the impression of secret society of some sort the same with his badge upon the forearm ""that be my idea too say white mason "well we can adopt it as work hypothesis and then see how far our difficulty disappear an agent from such society make his way into the house wait for mr. douglas blow his head nearly off with this weapon and escape by wade the moat after leave card beside the dead man which will when mention in the paper tell other member of the society that vengeance have be do that all hang together but why this gun of all weapons?""exactly ""and why the miss ring?""quite so ""and why no arrest it be past two now take it for grant that since dawn every constable within forty mile have be look out for wet stranger?""that be so mr. holmes ""well unless he have burrow close by or change of clothe ready they can hardly miss he and yet they have miss he up to now holme have go to the window and be examine with his lens the blood mark on the sill it be clearly the tread of shoe it be remarkably broad splay foot one would say curious because so far as one can trace any footmark in this mud stain corner one would say it be more shapely sole however they be certainly very indistinct what be this under the side table?""mr douglas 's dumb bell say ames "dumb bell there be only one where be the other?""i do n't know mr. holmes there may have be only one have not notice they for month ""one dumb bell holme say seriously but his remark be interrupt by sharp knock at the door tall sunburned capable look clean shave man look in at we have no difficulty in guess that it be the cecil barker of whom have hear his masterful eye travel quickly with questioning glance from face to face "sorry to interrupt your consultation say he but you should hear the late news ""an arrest?""no such luck but they 've find his bicycle the fellow leave his bicycle behind he come and have look it be within hundred yard of the hall door "we find three or four groom and idler stand in the drive inspect bicycle which have be draw out from clump of evergreen in which it have be conceal it be well use rudge whitworth splash as from considerable journey there be saddlebag with spanner and oilcan but no clue as to the owner "it would be grand help to the police say the inspector if these thing be number and register but we must be thankful for what
