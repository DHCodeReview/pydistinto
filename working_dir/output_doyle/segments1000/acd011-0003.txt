we 've get if we ca n't find where he go to at least we be likely to get where he come from but what in the name of all that be wonderful make the fellow leave it behind and how in the world have he get away without it we do n't seem to get gleam of light in the case mr. holmes ""don't we my friend answer thoughtfully wonder!""have you see all you want of the study ask white mason as we reentere the house "for the time say the inspector and holmes nod "then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the people in the house we could use the dining room ames please come yourself first and tell we what you know "the butler 's account be simple and clear one and he give convincing impression of sincerity he have be engage five year before when douglas first come to birlstone he understand that mr. douglas be rich gentleman who have make his money in america he have be kind and considerate employer not quite what ames be use to perhaps but one ca n't have everything he never see any sign of apprehension in mr. douglas on the contrary he be the most fearless man he have ever know he order the drawbridge to be pull up every night because it be the ancient custom of the old house and he like to keep the old way up mr. douglas seldom go to london or leave the village but on the day before the crime he have be shop at tunbridge wells he ames have observe some restlessness and excitement on the part of mr. douglas that day for he have seem impatient and irritable which be unusual with he he have not go to bed that night but be in the pantry at the back of the house put away the silver when he hear the bell ring violently he hear no shot but it be hardly possible he would as the pantry and kitchen be at the very back of the house and there be several closed door and long passage between the housekeeper have come out of her room attract by the violent ringing of the bell they have go to the front of the house together as they reach the bottom of the stair he have see mrs. douglas come down it no she be not hurry it do not seem to he that she be particularly agitated just as she reach the bottom of the stair mr. barker have rush out of the study he have stop mrs. douglas and beg she to go back "for god 's sake go back to your room he cry poor jack be dead you can do nothing for god 's sake go back!"after some persuasion upon the stair mrs. douglas have go back she do not scream she make no outcry whatever mrs. allen the housekeeper have take she upstairs and stay with she in the bedroom ame and mr. barker have then return to the study where they have find everything exactly as the police have see it the candle be not light at that time but the lamp be burn they have look out of the window but the night be very dark and nothing could be see or hear they have then rush out into the hall where ames have turn the windlass which lower the drawbridge mr. barker have then hurry off to get the police such in its essential be the evidence of the butler the account of mrs. allen the housekeeper be so far as it go corroboration of that of her fellow servant the housekeeper 's room be rather near to the front of the house than the pantry in which ames have be work she be prepare to go to bed when the loud ringing of the bell have attract her attention she be little hard of hearing perhaps that be why she have not hear the shot but in any case the study be long way off she remember hear some sound which she imagine to be the slamming of door that be good deal early half an hour at least before the ringing of the bell when mr. ames run to the front she go with he she see mr. barker very pale and excited come out of the study he intercept mrs. douglas who be come down the stair he entreat she to go back and she answer he but what she say could not be hear "take she up stay with she he have say to mrs. allen she have therefore take she to the bedroom and endeavour to soothe she she be greatly excited tremble all over but make no other attempt to go downstairs she just sit in her dressing gown by her bedroom fire with her head sink in her hand mrs. allen stay with her most of the night as to the other servant they have all go to bed and the alarm do not reach they until just before the police arrive they sleep at the extreme back of the house and could not possibly have hear anything so far the housekeeper could add nothing on cross examination save lamentation and expression of amazement cecil barker succeed mrs. allen as witness as to the occurrence of the night before he have very little to add to what he have already tell the police personally he be convince that the murderer have escape by the window the bloodstain be conclusive in his opinion on that point besides as the bridge be up there be no other possible way of escape he could not explain what have become of the assassin or why he have not take his bicycle if it be indeed his he could not possibly have be drown in the moat which be at no place more than three foot deep in his own mind he have very definite theory about the murder douglas be reticent man and there be some chapter in his life of which he never speak he have emigrate to america when he be very young man he have prosper well and barker have first meet he in california where they have become partner in successful mining claim at place call benito canyon they have do very well but douglas have suddenly sell out and start for england he be widower at that time barker have afterwards realize his money and come to live in london thus they have renew their friendship douglas have give he the impression that some danger be hang over his head and he have always look upon his sudden departure from california and also his rent house in so quiet place in england as be connect with this peril he imagine that some secret society some implacable organization be on douglas 's track which would never rest until it kill he some remark of his have give he this idea though he have never tell he what the society be nor how he have come to offend it he could only suppose that the legend upon the placard have some reference to this secret society "how long be you with douglas in california ask inspector macdonald "five year altogether ""he be bachelor you say?""a widower ""have you ever hear where his first wife come from?""no remember his say that she be of german extraction and have see her portrait she be very beautiful woman she die of typhoid the year before meet he ""you do n't associate his past with any particular part of america?""i have hear he talk of chicago he know that city well and have work there have hear he talk of the coal and iron district he have travel good deal in his time ""was he politician have this secret society to do with politics?""no he care nothing about politic ""you have no reason to think it be criminal?""on the contrary never meet straight man in my life ""was there anything curious about his life in california?""he like well to stay and to work at our claim in the mountain he would never go where other man be if he could help it that be why first think that someone be after he then when he leave so suddenly for europe make sure that it be so believe that he have warning of some sort within week of his leave half dozen man be inquire for he ""what sort of men?""well they be mighty hard look crowd they come up to the claim and want to know where he be tell they that he be go to europe and that do not know where to find he they mean he no good it be easy to see that ""were these man americans californians?""well do n't know about californians they be americans all right but they be not miner do n't know what they be and be very glad to see their back ""that be six year ago?""nearer seven ""and then you be together five year in california so that this business date back not less than eleven year at the least?""that be so ""it must be very serious feud that would be keep up with such earnestness for as long as that it would be no light thing that would give rise to it ""i think it shadow his whole life it be never quite out of his mind ""but if man have danger hang over he and know what it be do n't you think he would turn to the police for protection?""maybe it be some danger that he could not be protect against there be one thing you should know he always go about armed his revolver be never out of his pocket but by bad luck he be in his dressing gown and have leave it in the bedroom last night once the bridge be up guess he think he be safe ""i should like these date little clear say macdonald it be quite six year since douglas leave california you follow he next year do you not?""that be so ""and he have be marry five year you must have return about the time of his marriage ""about month before be his good man ""did you know mrs. douglas before her marriage?""no do not have be away from england for ten year ""but you have see good deal of she since "barker look sternly at the detective have see good deal of him since he answer if have see she it be because you can not visit man without know his wife if you imagine there be any connection imagine nothing mr. barker be bind to make every inquiry which can bear upon the case but mean no offense ""some inquiry be offensive barker answer angrily "it be only the fact that we want it be in your interest and everyone 's interest that they should be clear up do mr. douglas entirely approve your friendship with his wife?"barker grow paler and his great strong hand be clasp convulsively together you have no right to ask such question he cry what have this to do with the matter you be investigating?""i must repeat the question ""well refuse to answer ""you can refuse to answer but you must be aware that your refusal be in itself an answer for you would not refuse if you have not something to conceal "barker stand for moment with his face set grimly and his strong black eyebrow draw low in intense thought then he look up with smile well guess you gentleman be only do your clear duty after all and have no right to stand in the way of it 'd only ask you not to worry mrs. douglas over this matter for she have enough upon she just now may tell you that poor douglas have just one fault in the world and that be his jealousy he be fond of i no man could be fonder of friend and he be devoted to his wife he love i to come here and be forever send for i and yet if his wife and talk together or there seem any sympathy between we kind of wave of jealousy would pass over he and he would be off the handle and say the wild thing in moment more than once 've swear off come for that reason and then he would write i such penitent imploring letter that just have to but you can take it from i gentleman if it be my last word that no man ever have more loving faithful wife and can say also no friend could be more loyal than i!"it be speak with fervour and feeling and yet inspector macdonald could not dismiss the subject "you be aware say he that the dead man 's wedding ring have be take from his finger?""so it appear say barker "what do you mean by appear you know it as fact "the man seem confused and undecided when say appear mean that it be conceivable that he have himself take off the ring ""the mere fact that the ring should be absent whoever may have remove it would suggest to anyone 's mind would it not that the marriage and the tragedy be connected?"barker shrug his broad shoulder ca n't profess to say what it mean he answer but if you mean to hint that it could reflect in any way upon this lady 's honour his eye blaze for an instant and then with an evident effort he get grip upon his own emotion well you be on the wrong track that be all ""i do n't know that 've anything else to ask you at present say macdonald coldly "there be one small point remark sherlock holmes when you enter the room there be only candle light on the table be there not?""yes that be so ""by its light you see that some terrible incident have occurred?""exactly ""you at once ring for help?""yes ""and it arrive very speedily?""within minute or so ""and yet when they arrive they find that the candle be out and that the lamp have be light that seem very remarkable "again barker show some sign of indecision do n't see that it be remarkable mr. holmes he answer after pause the candle throw very bad light my first thought be to get well one the lamp be on the table so light it ""and blow out the candle?""exactly "holme ask no further question and barker with deliberate look from one to the other of we which have as it seem to i something of defiance in it turn and leave the room inspector macdonald have send up note to the effect that he would wait upon mrs. douglas in her room but she have reply that she would meet we in the dining room she enter now tall and beautiful woman of thirty reserved and self possess to remarkable degree very different from the tragic and distracted figure have picture it be true that her face be pale and draw like that of one who have endure great shock but her manner be compose and the finely mould hand which she rest upon the edge of the table be as steady as my own her sad appeal eye travel from one to the other of we with curiously inquisitive expression that questioning gaze transform itself suddenly into abrupt speech "have you find anything out yet she ask be it my imagination that there be an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question?"we have take every possible step mrs. douglas say the inspector you may rest assure that nothing will be neglect ""spare no money she say in dead even tone it be my desire that every possible effort should be make ""perhaps you can tell we something which may throw some light upon the matter ""i fear not but all know be at your service ""we have hear from mr. cecil barker that you do not actually see that you be never in the room where the tragedy occurred?""no he turn i back upon the stair he beg i to return to my room ""quite so you have hear the shot and you have at once come down ""i put on my dressing gown and then come down ""how long be it after hear the shot that you be stop on the stair by mr. barker?""it may have be couple of minute it be so hard to reckon time at such moment he implore i not to go on he assure i that could do nothing then mrs. allen the housekeeper lead i upstairs again it be all like some dreadful dream ""can you give we any idea how long your husband have be downstairs before you hear the shot?""no can not say he go from his dressing room and do not hear he go he do the round of the house every night for he be nervous of fire it be the only thing that have ever know he nervous of ""that be just the point which want to come to mrs. douglas you have know your husband only in england have you not?""yes we have be marry five year ""have you hear he speak of anything which occur in america and might bring some danger upon him?"mrs douglas think earnestly before she answer yes she say at last have always feel that there be danger hang over he he refuse to discuss it with i it be not from want of confidence in i there be the most complete love and confidence between we but it be out of his desire to keep all alarm away from i he think should brood over it if know all and so he be silent ""how do you know it then?"mrs douglas 's face light with quick smile can husband ever carry about secret all his life and woman who love he have no suspicion of it know it by his refusal to talk about some episode in his american life know it by certain precaution he take know it by certain word he let fall know it by the way he look at unexpected stranger be perfectly certain that he have some powerful enemy that he believe they be on his track and that he be always on his guard against they be so sure of it that for year have be terrify if ever he come home later than be expect ""might ask ask holmes what the word be which attract your attention?""the valley of fear the lady answer that be an expression he have use when question he have be in the valley of fear be not out of it yet be we never to get out of the valley of fear have ask he when have see he more serious than usual sometimes think that we never shall he have answer ""surely you ask he what he mean by the valley of fear?""i do but his face would become very grave and he would shake his head it be bad enough that one of we should have be in its shadow he say please god it shall never fall upon you it be some real valley in which he have live and in which something terrible have occur to he of that be certain but can tell you no more ""and he never mention any names?""yes he be delirious with fever once when he have his hunting accident three year ago then remember that there be name that come continually to his lip he speak it with anger and sort of horror mcginty be the name bodymaster mcginty ask he when he recover who bodymaster mcginty be and whose body he be master of never of mine thank god he answer with laugh and that be all could get from he but there be connection between bodymaster mcginty and the valley of fear ""there be one other point say inspector macdonald you meet mr. douglas in boarding house in london do you not and become engaged to he there be there any romance anything secret or mysterious about the wedding?""there be romance there be always romance there be nothing mysterious ""he have no rival?""no be quite free ""you have hear no doubt that his wedding ring have be take do that suggest anything to you suppose that some enemy of his old life have track he down and commit this crime what possible reason could he have for take his wedding ring?"for an instant could have swear that the faint shadow of smile flicker over the woman 's lip "i really can not tell she answer it be certainly most extraordinary thing ""well we will not detain you any long and we be sorry to have put you to this trouble at such time say the inspector there be some other point no doubt but we can refer to you as they arise "she rise and be again conscious of that quick question glance with which she have just survey we what impression have my evidence make upon you the question might as well have be speak then with bow she sweep from the room "she be beautiful woman very beautiful woman say macdonald thoughtfully after the door have close behind she this man barker have certainly be down here good deal he be man who might be attractive to woman he admit that the dead man be jealous and maybe he know good himself what cause he have for jealousy then there be that wedding ring you ca n't get past that the man who tear wedding ring off dead man 's what do you say to it mr. holmes?"my friend have sit with his head upon his hand sink in the deep thought now he rise and ring the bell ame he say when the butler enter where be mr. cecil barker now?""i'll see sir "he come back in moment to say that barker be in the garden "can you remember ames what mr. barker have on his foot last night when you join he in the study?""yes mr. holmes he have pair of bedroom slipper bring he his boot when he go for the police ""where be the slipper now?""they be still under the chair in the hall ""very good ames it be of course important for we to know which track may be mr. barker 's and which from outside ""yes sir may say that notice that the slipper be stain with blood so indeed be my own ""that be natural enough consider the condition of the room very good ames we will ring if we want you "a few minute later we be in the study holme have bring with he the carpet slipper from the hall as ames have observe the sol of both be dark with blood "strange murmur holmes as he stand in the light of the window and examine they minutely very strange indeed!"stooping with one of his quick feline pounce he place the slipper upon the blood mark on the sill it exactly correspond he smile in silence at his colleague the inspector be transfigure with excitement his native accent rattle like stick upon railing "man he cry there be not doubt of it barker have just mark the window himself it be good deal broad than any bootmark mind that you say it be splay foot and here be the explanation but what be the game mr. holmes what be the game?""ay what be the game my friend repeat thoughtfully white mason chuckle and rub his fat hand together in his professional satisfaction say it be snorter he cry and real snorter it is!"the three detective have many matter of detail into which to inquire so return alone to our modest quarter at the village inn but before do so take stroll in the curious old world garden which flank the house row of very ancient yew tree cut into strange design gird it round inside be beautiful stretch of lawn with an old sundial in the middle the whole effect so soothing and restful that it be welcome to my somewhat jangle nerve in that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget or remember only as some fantastic nightmare that darken study with the sprawling bloodstained figure on the floor and yet as stroll round it and try to steep my soul in its gentle balm strange incident occur which bring i back to the tragedy and leave sinister impression in my mind have say that decoration of yew tree circle the garden at the end farthest from the house they thicken into continuous hedge on the other side of this hedge conceal from the eye of anyone approach from the direction of the house
