there be stone seat as approach the spot be aware of voice some remark in the deep tone of man answer by little ripple of feminine laughter an instant later have come round the end of the hedge and my eye light upon mrs. douglas and the man barker before they be aware of my presence her appearance give i shock in the dining room she have be demure and discreet now all pretense of grief have pass away from she her eye shine with the joy of living and her face still quiver with amusement at some remark of her companion he sit forward his hand clasp and his forearm on his knee with an answer smile upon his bold handsome face in an instant but it be just one instant too late they resume their solemn mask as my figure come into view hurried word or two pass between they and then barker rise and come towards i "excuse i sir say he but be address dr. watson?"i bow with coldness which show dare say very plainly the impression which have be produce upon my mind "we think that it be probably you as your friendship with mr. sherlock holmes be so well known would you mind come over and speak to mrs. douglas for one instant?"i follow he with dour face very clearly could see in my mind 's eye that shatter figure on the floor here within few hour of the tragedy be his wife and his near friend laugh together behind bush in the garden which have be his greet the lady with reserve have grieve with her grief in the dining room now meet her appeal gaze with an unresponsive eye "i fear that you think i callous and hard hearted say she shrug my shoulder it be no business of mine say i."perhaps some day you will do i justice if you only realize there be no need why dr. watson should realize say barker quickly as he have himself say it be no possible business of his ""exactly say and so will beg leave to resume my walk ""one moment dr. watson cry the woman in plead voice there be one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone else in the world and it may make very great difference to i you know mr. holmes and his relation with the police well than anyone else can suppose that matter be bring confidentially to his knowledge be it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the detectives?""yes that be it say barker eagerly be he on his own or be he entirely in with them?""i really do n't know that should be justify in discuss such point ""i beg implore that you will dr. watson assure you that you will be help we help i greatly if you will guide we on that point "there be such ring of sincerity in the woman 's voice that for the instant forget all about her levity and be move only to do her will "mr holmes be an independent investigator say he be his own master and would act as his own judgment direct at the same time he would naturally feel loyalty towards the official who be work on the same case and he would not conceal from they anything which would help they in bring criminal to justice beyond this can say nothing and would refer you to mr. holmes himself if you want full information "so say raise my hat and go upon my way leave they still seat behind that conceal hedge look back as round the far end of it and see that they be still talk very earnestly together and as they be gaze after i it be clear that it be our interview that be the subject of their debate "i wish none of their confidence say holmes when report to he what have occur he have spend the whole afternoon at the manor house in consultation with his two colleague and return about five with ravenous appetite for high tea which have order for he no confidence watson for they be mighty awkward if it come to an arrest for conspiracy and murder ""you think it will come to that?"he be in his most cheerful and debonair humour my dear watson when have exterminate that fourth egg shall be ready to put you in touch with the whole situation do n't say that we have fathom it far from it but when we have trace the missing dumb bell the dumb bell!""dear i watson be it possible that you have not penetrate the fact that the case hang upon the miss dumb bell well well you need not be downcast for between ourselves do n't think that either inspector mac or the excellent local practitioner have grasp the overwhelming importance of this incident one dumb bell watson consider an athlete with one dumb bell picture to yourself the unilateral development the imminent danger of spinal curvature shocking watson shocking!"he sit with his mouth full of toast and his eye sparkle with mischief watch my intellectual entanglement the mere sight of his excellent appetite be an assurance of success for have very clear recollection of day and night without thought of food when his baffled mind have chafe before some problem while his thin eager feature become more attenuate with the asceticism of complete mental concentration finally he light his pipe and sit in the inglenook of the old village inn he talk slowly and at random about his case rather as one who think aloud than as one who make consider statement "a lie watson great big thumping obtrusive uncompromise lie that be what meet we on the threshold there be our starting point the whole story tell by barker be lie but barker 's story be corroborate by mrs. douglas therefore she be lie also they be both lie and in conspiracy so now we have the clear problem why be they lie and what be the truth which they be try so hard to conceal let we try watson you and if we can get behind the lie and reconstruct the truth "how do know that they be lie because it be clumsy fabrication which simply could not be true consider accord to the story give to we the assassin have less than minute after the murder have be commit to take that ring which be under another ring from the dead man 's finger to replace the other ring thing which he would surely never have do and to put that singular card beside his victim say that this be obviously impossible "you may argue but have too much respect for your judgment watson to think that you will do so that the ring may have be take before the man be kill the fact that the candle have be light only short time show that there have be no lengthy interview be douglas from what we hear of his fearless character man who would be likely to give up his wedding ring at such short notice or could we conceive of his give it up at all no no watson the assassin be alone with the dead man for some time with the lamp light of that have no doubt at all "but the gunshot be apparently the cause of death therefore the shot must have be fire some time early than we be tell but there could be no mistake about such matter as that we be in the presence therefore of deliberate conspiracy upon the part of the two people who hear the gunshot of the man barker and of the woman douglas when on the top of this be able to show that the blood mark on the windowsill be deliberately place there by barker in order to give false clue to the police you will admit that the case grow dark against he "now we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually do occur up to half past ten the servant be move about the house so it be certainly not before that time at quarter to eleven they have all go to their room with the exception of ames who be in the pantry have be try some experiment after you leave we this afternoon and find that no noise which macdonald can make in the study can penetrate to i in the pantry when the door be all shut "it be otherwise however from the housekeeper 's room it be not so far down the corridor and from it could vaguely hear voice when it be very loudly raise the sound from shotgun be to some extent muffle when the discharge be at very close range as it undoubtedly be in this instance it would not be very loud and yet in the silence of the night it should have easily penetrate to mrs. allen 's room she be as she have tell we somewhat deaf but none the less she mention in her evidence that she do hear something like door slamming half an hour before the alarm be give half an hour before the alarm be give would be quarter to eleven have no doubt that what she hear be the report of the gun and that this be the real instant of the murder "if this be so we have now to determine what barker and mrs. douglas presume that they be not the actual murderer could have be do from quarter to eleven when the sound of the shot bring they down until quarter past eleven when they ring the bell and summon the servant what be they do and why do they not instantly give the alarm that be the question which face we and when it have be answer we shall surely have go some way to solve our problem ""i be convince myself say that there be an understanding between those two people she must be heartless creature to sit laugh at some jest within few hour of her husband 's murder ""exactly she do not shine as wife even in her own account of what occur be not whole souled admirer of womankind as you be aware watson but my experience of life have teach i that there be few wife have any regard for their husband who would let any man 's spoken word stand between they and that husband 's dead body should ever marry watson should hope to inspire my wife with some feeling which would prevent she from be walk off by housekeeper when my corpse be lie within few yard of she it be badly stage manage for even the raw investigator must be strike by the absence of the usual feminine ululation if there have be nothing else this incident alone would have suggest prearrange conspiracy to my mind ""you think then definitely that barker and mrs. douglas be guilty of the murder?""there be an appalling directness about your question watson say holmes shake his pipe at i they come at i like bullet if you put it that mrs. douglas and barker know the truth about the murder and be conspire to conceal it then can give you whole souled answer be sure they do but your more deadly proposition be not so clear let we for moment consider the difficulty which stand in the way "we will suppose that this couple be unite by the bond of guilty love and that they have determine to get rid of the man who stand between they it be large supposition for discreet inquiry among servant and other have fail to corroborate it in any way on the contrary there be good deal of evidence that the douglases be very attached to each other ""that be sure can not be true say thinking of the beautiful smile face in the garden "well at least they give that impression however we will suppose that they be an extraordinarily astute couple who deceive everyone upon this point and conspire to murder the husband he happen to be man over whose head some danger hang we have only their word for that "holme look thoughtful see watson you be sketch out theory by which everything they say from the beginning be false accord to your idea there be never any hidden menace or secret society or valley of fear or boss macsomebody or anything else well that be good sweeping generalization let we see what that bring we to they invent this theory to account for the crime they then play up to the idea by leave this bicycle in the park as proof of the existence of some outsider the stain on the windowsill convey the same idea so do the card on the body which might have be prepare in the house that all fit into your hypothesis watson but now we come on the nasty angular uncompromise bit which wo n't slip into their place why cut off shotgun of all weapon and an american one at that how could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to they it be mere chance as it be that mrs. allen do not start out to inquire for the slamming door why do your guilty couple do all this watson?""i confes that ca n't explain it ""then again if woman and her lover conspire to murder husband be they go to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously remove his wedding ring after his death do that strike you as very probable watson?""no it do not ""and once again if the thought of leave bicycle conceal outside have occur to you would it really have seem worth do when the dull detective would naturally say this be an obvious blind as the bicycle be the first thing which the fugitive need in order to make his escape ""i can conceive of no explanation ""and yet there should be no combination of event for which the wit of man can not conceive an explanation simply as mental exercise without any assertion that it be true let i indicate possible line of thought it be admit mere imagination but how often be imagination the mother of truth?"we will suppose that there be guilty secret really shameful secret in the life of this man douglas this lead to his murder by someone who be we will suppose an avenger someone from outside this avenger for some reason which confess be still at loss to explain take the dead man 's wedding ring the vendetta might conceivably date back to the man 's first marriage and the ring be take for some such reason "before this avenger get away barker and the wife have reach the room the assassin convince they that any attempt to arrest he would lead to the publication of some hideous scandal they be convert to this idea and prefer to let he go for this purpose they probably lower the bridge which can be do quite noiselessly and then raise it again he make his escape and for some reason think that he could do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle he therefore leave his machine where it would not be discover until he have get safely away so far we be within the bound of possibility be we not?""well it be possible no doubt say with some reserve "we have to remember watson that whatever occur be certainly something very extraordinary well now to continue our supposititious case the couple not necessarily guilty couple realize after the murderer be go that they have place themselves in position in which it may be difficult for they to prove that they do not themselves either do the deed or connive at it they rapidly and rather clumsily meet the situation the mark be put by barker 's bloodstained slipper upon the windowsill to suggest how the fugitive get away they obviously be the two who must have hear the sound of the gun so they give the alarm exactly as they would have do but good half hour after the event ""and how do you propose to prove all this?""well if there be an outsider he may be trace and take that would be the most effective of all proof but if not well the resource of science be far from be exhausted think that an evening alone in that study would help i much ""an evening alone!""i propose to go up there presently have arrange it with the estimable ames who be by no mean wholehearte about barker shall sit in that room and see if its atmosphere bring i inspiration be believer in the genius loci you smile friend watson well we shall see by the way you have that big umbrella of your have you not?""it be here ""well 'll borrow that if may ""certainly but what wretched weapon if there be danger nothing serious my dear watson or should certainly ask for your assistance but 'll take the umbrella at present be only await the return of our colleague from tunbridge wells where they be at present engage in try for likely owner to the bicycle "it be nightfall before inspector macdonald and white mason come back from their expedition and they arrive exultant report great advance in our investigation "man 'll admeet that have my doubt if there be ever an outsider say macdonald but that be all past now we 've have the bicycle identify and we have description of our man so that be long step on our journey ""it sound to i like the beginning of the end say holmes be sure congratulate you both with all my heart ""well start from the fact that mr. douglas have seem disturb since the day before when he have be at tunbridge wells it be at tunbridge wells then that he have become conscious of some danger it be clear therefore that if man have come over with bicycle it be from tunbridge wells that he might be expect to have come we take the bicycle over with we and show it at the hotel it be identify at once by the manager of the eagle commercial as belong to man name hargrave who have take room there two day before this bicycle and small valise be his whole belonging he have register his name as come from london but have give no address the valise be london make and the content be british but the man himself be undoubtedly an american ""well well say holmes gleefully you have indeed do some solid work while have be sit spin theory with my friend it be lesson in be practical mr. mac ""ay it be just that mr. holmes say the inspector with satisfaction "but this may all fit in with your theory remark "that may or may not be but let we hear the end mr. mac be there nothing to identify this man?""so little that it be evident that he have carefully guard himself against identification there be no paper or letter and no marking upon the clothe cycle map of the county lie on his bedroom table he have leave the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle and no more be hear of he until our inquiry ""that be what puzzle i mr. holmes say white mason if the fellow do not want the hue and cry raise over he one would imagine that he would have return and remain at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist as it be he must know that he will be report to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connect with the murder ""so one would imagine still he have be justify of his wisdom up to date at any rate since he have not be take but his description what of that?"macdonald refer to his notebook here we have it so far as they could give it they do n't seem to have take any very particular stock of he but still the porter the clerk and the chambermaid be all agree that this about cover the point he be man about five foot nine in height fifty or so year of age his hair slightly grizzle grayish moustache curved nose and face which all of they describe as fierce and forbid ""well bar the expression that might almost be description of douglas himself say holmes he be just over fifty with grizzle hair and moustache and about the same height do you get anything else?""he be dress in heavy gray suit with reefer jacket and he wear short yellow overcoat and soft cap ""what about the shotgun?""it be less than two foot long it could very well have fit into his valise he could have carry it inside his overcoat without difficulty ""and how do you consider that all this bear upon the general case?""well mr. holmes say macdonald when we have get our man and you may be sure that have his description on the wire within five minute of hear it we shall be well able to judge but even as it stand we have surely go long way we know that an american call himself hargrave come to tunbridge wells two day ago with bicycle and valise in the latter be saw off shotgun so he come with the deliberate purpose of crime yesterday morning he set off for this place on his bicycle with his gun conceal in his overcoat no one see he arrive so far as we can learn but he need not pass through the village to reach the park gate and there be many cyclist upon the road presumably he at once conceal his cycle among the laurel where it be find and possibly lurk there himself with his eye on the house wait for mr. douglas to come out the shotgun be strange weapon to use inside house but he have intend to use it outside and there it have very obvious advantage as it would be impossible to miss with it and the sound of shot be so common in an english sporting neighbourhood that no particular notice would be take ""that be all very clear say holmes "well mr. douglas do not appear what be he to do next he leave his bicycle and approach the house in the twilight he find the bridge down and no one about he take his chance intend no doubt to make some excuse if he meet anyone he meet no one he slip into the first room that he see and conceal himself behind the curtain thence he could see the drawbridge go up and he know that his only escape be through the moat he wait until quarter past eleven when mr. douglas upon his usual nightly round come into the room he shoot he and escape as arrange he be aware that the bicycle would be describe by the hotel people and be clue against he so he leave it there and make his way by some other mean to london or to some safe hiding place which he have already arrange how be that mr. holmes?""well mr. mac it be very good and very clear so far as it go that be your end of the story my end be that the crime be commit half an hour early than report that mrs. douglas and barker be both in conspiracy to conceal something that they aid the murderer 's escape or at least that they reach the room before he escape and that they fabricate evidence of his escape through the window whereas in all probability they have themselves let he go by lower the bridge that be my reading of the first half "the two detective shake their head "well mr. holmes if this be true we only tumble out of one mystery into another say the london inspector "and in some way bad one add white mason the lady have never be in america in all her life what possible connection could she have with an american assassin which would cause she to shelter him?""i freely admit the difficulty say holmes propose to make little investigation of my own to night and it be just possible that it may contribute something to the common cause ""can we help you mr. holmes?""no no darkness and dr. watson 's umbrella my want be simple and ames the faithful ames no doubt he will stretch point for i all my line of thought lead i back invariably to the one basic question why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument as single dumb bell?"it be late that night when holmes return from his solitary excursion we sleep in double bedded room which be the good that the little country inn could do for we be already asleep when be partly awaken by his entrance "well holmes
