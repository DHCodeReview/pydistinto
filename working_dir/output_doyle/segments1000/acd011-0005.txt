murmur have you find anything out?"he stand beside i in silence his candle in his hand then the tall lean figure incline towards i say watson he whisper would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with lunatic man with softening of the brain an idiot whose mind have lose its grip?""not in the least answer in astonishment "ah that be lucky he say and not another word would he utter that night next morning after breakfast we find inspector macdonald and white mason seat in close consultation in the small parlour of the local police sergeant on the table in front of they be pile number of letter and telegram which they be carefully sort and docket three have be place on one side "still on the track of the elusive bicyclist holmes ask cheerfully what be the late news of the ruffian?"macdonald point ruefully to his heap of correspondence "he be at present report from leicester nottingham southampton derby east ham richmond and fourteen other place in three of they east ham leicester and liverpool there be clear case against he and he have actually be arrest the country seem to be full of the fugitive with yellow coat ""dear i say holmes sympathetically now mr. mac and you mr. white mason wish to give you very earnest piece of advice when go into this case with you bargain as you will no doubt remember that should not present you with half prove theory but that should retain and work out my own idea until have satisfy myself that they be correct for this reason be not at the present moment tell you all that be in my mind on the other hand say that would play the game fairly by you and do not think it be fair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your energy upon profitless task therefore be here to advise you this morning and my advice to you be sum up in three word abandon the case "macdonald and white mason stare in amazement at their celebrated colleague "you consider it hopeless cry the inspector "i consider your case to be hopeless do not consider that it be hopeless to arrive at the truth ""but this cyclist he be not an invention we have his description his valise his bicycle the fellow must be somewhere why should we not get him?""yes yes no doubt he be somewhere and no doubt we shall get he but would not have you waste your energy in east ham or liverpool be sure that we can find some short cut to result ""you be hold something back it be hardly fair of you mr. holmes the inspector be annoyed "you know my method of work mr. mac but will hold it back for the short time possible only wish to verify my detail in one way which can very readily be do and then make my bow and return to london leave my result entirely at your service owe you too much to act otherwise for in all my experience can not recall any more singular and interesting study ""this be clean beyond i mr. holmes we see you when we return from tunbridge wells last night and you be in general agreement with our result what have happen since then to give you completely new idea of the case?""well since you ask i spend as tell you that would some hour last night at the manor house ""well what happened?""ah can only give you very general answer to that for the moment by the way have be read short but clear and interesting account of the old building purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist "here holme draw small tract embellish with rude engraving of the ancient manor house from his waistcoat pocket "it immensely add to the z of an investigation my dear mr. mac when one be in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of one 's surrounding do n't look so impatient for assure you that even so bald an account as this raise some sort of picture of the past in one 's mind permit i to give you sample erect in the fifth year of the reign of james and stand upon the site of much old building the manor house of birlstone present one of the fine survive example of the moated jacobean residence you be make fool of we mr. holmes!""tut tut mr. mac the first sign of temper have detect in you well wo n't read it verbatim since you feel so strongly upon the subject but when tell you that there be some account of the taking of the place by parliamentary colonel in 1644 of the concealment of charles for several day in the course of the civil war and finally of visit there by the second george you will admit that there be various association of interest connect with this ancient house ""i do n't doubt it mr. holmes but that be no business of ours ""is it not be it not breadth of view my dear mr. mac be one of the essential of our profession the interplay of idea and the oblique use of knowledge be often of extraordinary interest you will excuse these remark from one who though mere connoisseur of crime be still rather old and perhaps more experienced than yourself ""i'm the first to admit that say the detective heartily you get to your point admit but you have such deuce round the corner way of do it ""well well 'll drop past history and get down to present day fact call last night as have already say at the manor house do not see either barker or mrs. douglas see no necessity to disturb they but be pleased to hear that the lady be not visibly pine and that she have partake of an excellent dinner my visit be specially make to the good mr. ames with whom exchange some amiability which culminate in his allow i without reference to anyone else to sit alone for time in the study ""what with that ejaculate "no no everything be now in order you give permission for that mr. mac as be inform the room be in its normal state and in it pass an instructive quarter of an hour ""what be you doing?""well not to make mystery of so simple matter be look for the missing dumb bell it have always bulk rather large in my estimate of the case end by find it ""where?""ah there we come to the edge of the unexplored let i go little far very little far and will promise that you shall share everything that know ""well we be bind to take you on your own term say the inspector but when it come to tell we to abandon the case why in the name of goodness should we abandon the case?""for the simple reason my dear mr. mac that you have not get the first idea what it be that you be investigate ""we be investigate the murder of mr. john douglas of birlstone manor ""yes yes so you be but do n't trouble to trace the mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle assure you that it wo n't help you ""then what do you suggest that we do?""i will tell you exactly what to do if you will do it ""well be bind to say 've always find you have reason behind all your queer way 'll do what you advise ""and you mr. white mason?"the country detective look helplessly from one to the other holme and his method be new to he well if it be good enough for the inspector it be good enough for i he say at last "capital say holmes well then should recommend nice cheery country walk for both of you they tell i that the view from birlstone ridge over the weald be very remarkable no doubt lunch could be get at some suitable hostelry though my ignorance of the country prevent i from recommend one in the evening tired but happy man this be get past joke cry macdonald rise angrily from his chair "well well spend the day as you like say holmes pat he cheerfully upon the shoulder do what you like and go where you will but meet i here before dusk without fail without fail mr. mac ""that sound more like sanity ""all of it be excellent advice but do n't insist so long as you be here when need you but now before we part want you to write note to mr. barker ""well?""i'll dictate it if you like ready?"dear sir:"it have strike i that it be our duty to drain the moat in the hope that we may find some it be impossible say the inspector 've make inquiry ""tut tut my dear sir please do what ask you ""well go on in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our investigation have make arrangement and the workman will be at work early to morrow morning divert the stream impossible divert the stream so think it well to explain matter beforehand "now sign that and send it by hand about four o'clock at that hour we shall meet again in this room until then we may each do what we like for can assure you that this inquiry have come to definite pause "evening be draw in when we reassemble holmes be very serious in his manner myself curious and the detective obviously critical and annoyed "well gentleman say my friend gravely be ask you now to put everything to the test with i and you will judge for yourself whether the observation have make justify the conclusion to which have come it be chill evening and do not know how long our expedition may last so beg that you will wear your warm coat it be of the first importance that we should be in our place before it grow dark so with your permission we shall get start at once "we pass along the outer bound of the manor house park until we come to place where there be gap in the rail which fence it through this we slip and then in the gathering gloom we follow holmes until we have reach shrubbery which lie nearly opposite to the main door and the drawbridge the latter have not be raise holme crouch down behind the screen of laurel and we all three follow his example "well what be we to do now ask macdonald with some gruffness "possess our soul in patience and make as little noise as possible holme answer "what be we here for at all really think that you might treat we with more frankness "holme laugh watson insist that be the dramatist in real life say he some touch of the artist well up within i and call insistently for well stage performance surely our profession mr. mac would be drab and sordid one if we do not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our result the blunt accusation the brutal tap upon the shoulder what can one make of such denouement but the quick inference the subtle trap the clever forecast of come event the triumphant vindication of bold theory be these not the pride and the justification of our life 's work at the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt where would be that thrill if have be as definite as timetable only ask little patience mr. mac and all will be clear to you ""well hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come before we all get our death of cold say the london detective with comic resignation we all have good reason to join in the aspiration for our vigil be long and bitter one slowly the shadow darken over the long sombre face of the old house cold damp reek from the moat chill we to the bone and set our tooth chatter there be single lamp over the gateway and steady globe of light in the fatal study everything else be dark and still "how long be this to last ask the inspector finally and what be it we be watch for?""i have no more notion than you how long it be to last holme answer with some asperity if criminal would always schedule their movement like railway train it would certainly be more convenient for all of we as to what it be we well that be what we be watch for!"as he speak the bright yellow light in the study be obscure by somebody pass to and fro before it the laurel among which we lay be immediately opposite the window and not more than hundred foot from it presently it be throw open with whining of hinge and we could dimly see the dark outline of man 's head and shoulder look out into the gloom for some minute he peer forth in furtive stealthy fashion as one who wish to be assure that he be unobserved then he lean forward and in the intense silence we be aware of the soft lapping of agitated water he seem to be stir up the moat with something which he hold in his hand then suddenly he haul something in as fisherman land fish some large round object which obscure the light as it be drag through the open casement "now cry holmes now!"we be all upon our foot stagger after he with our stiffen limb while he run swiftly across the bridge and ring violently at the bell there be the rasping of bolt from the other side and the amazed ame stand in the entrance holme brush he aside without word and follow by all of we rush into the room which have be occupy by the man whom we have be watch the oil lamp on the table represent the glow which we have see from outside it be now in the hand of cecil barker who hold it towards we as we enter its light shine upon his strong resolute clean shave face and his menacing eye "what the devil be the meaning of all this he cry what be you after anyhow?"holme take swift glance round and then pounce upon sodden bundle tie together with cord which lie where it have be thrust under the writing table "this be what we be after mr. barker this bundle weight with dumb bell which you have just raise from the bottom of the moat "barker stare at holmes with amazement in his face how in thunder come you to know anything about it he ask "simply that put it there ""you put it there you!""perhap should have say replace it there say holmes you will remember inspector macdonald that be somewhat strike by the absence of dumb bell draw your attention to it but with the pressure of other event you have hardly the time to give it the consideration which would have enable you to draw deduction from it when water be near and weight be miss it be not very far fetched supposition that something have be sink in the water the idea be at least worth testing so with the help of ames who admit i to the room and the crook of dr. watson 's umbrella be able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle "it be of the first importance however that we should be able to prove who place it there this we accomplish by the very obvious device of announce that the moat would be dry to morrow which have of course the effect that whoever have hide the bundle would most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enable he to do so we have no less than four witness as to who it be who take advantage of the opportunity and so mr. barker think the word lie now with you "sherlock holmes put the sop bundle upon the table beside the lamp and undo the cord which bind it from within he extract dumb bell which he toss down to its fellow in the corner next he draw forth pair of boot american as you perceive he remark point to the toe then he lay upon the table long deadly sheathe knife finally he unravel bundle of clothing comprise complete set of underclothe sock gray tweed suit and short yellow overcoat "the clothe be commonplace remark holmes save only the overcoat which be full of suggestive touch he hold it tenderly towards the light here as you perceive be the inner pocket prolong into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for the truncated fowling piece the tailor 's tab be on the neck neal outfitter vermissa u.s.a. have spend an instructive afternoon in the rector 's library and have enlarge my knowledge by add the fact that vermissa be flourish little town at the head of one of the well know coal and iron valley in the united states have some recollection mr. barker that you associate the coal district with mr. douglas 's first wife and it would surely not be too far fetched an inference that the v.v. upon the card by the dead body might stand for vermissa valley or that this very valley which send forth emissary of murder may be that valley of fear of which we have hear so much be fairly clear and now mr. barker seem to be stand rather in the way of your explanation "it be sight to see cecil barker 's expressive face during this exposition of the great detective anger amazement consternation and indecision sweep over it in turn finally he take refuge in somewhat acrid irony "you know such lot mr. holmes perhaps you have well tell we some more he sneer "i have no doubt that could tell you great deal more mr. barker but it would come with well grace from you ""oh you think so do you well all can say be that if there be any secret here it be not my secret and be not the man to give it away ""well if you take that line mr. barker say the inspector quietly we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold you ""you can do what you damn please about that say barker defiantly the proceeding seem to have come to definite end so far as he be concern for one have only to look at that granite face to realize that no peine forte et dure would ever force he to plead against his will the deadlock be break however by woman 's voice mrs. douglas have be stand listen at the half open door and now she enter the room "you have do enough for now cecil say she whatever come of it in the future you have do enough ""enough and more than enough remark sherlock holmes gravely have every sympathy with you madam and should strongly urge you to have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence it may be that be myself at fault for not follow up the hint which you convey to i through my friend dr. watson but at that time have every reason to believe that you be directly concerned in the crime now be assure that this be not so at the same time there be much that be unexplained and should strongly recommend that you ask mr. douglas to tell we his own story "mrs douglas give cry of astonishment at holmes 's word the detective and must have echo it when we be aware of man who seem to have emerge from the wall who advance now from the gloom of the corner in which he have appear mrs. douglas turn and in an instant her arm be round he barker have seize his outstretched hand "it 's good this way jack his wife repeat be sure that it be good ""indeed yes mr. douglas say sherlock holmes be sure that you will find it good "the man stand blink at we with the daze look of one who come from the dark into the light it be remarkable face bold gray eye strong short clip grizzle moustache square project chin and humorous mouth he take good look at we all and then to my amazement he advance to i and hand i bundle of paper "i've hear of you say he in voice which be not quite english and not quite american but be altogether mellow and pleasing you be the historian of this bunch well dr. watson you 've never have such story as that pass through your hand before and 'll lay my last dollar on that tell it your own way but there be the fact and you ca n't miss the public so long as you have those 've be coope up two day and 've spend the daylight hour as much daylight as could get in that rat trap in put the thing into word you be welcome to they you and your public there be the story of the valley of fear ""that be the past mr. douglas say sherlock holmes quietly what we desire now be to hear your story of the present ""you'll have it sir say douglas may smoke as talk well thank you mr. holmes you be smoker yourself if remember right and you 'll guess what it be to be sit for two day with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away he lean against the mantelpiece and suck at the cigar which holmes have hand he 've hear of you mr. holmes never guess that should meet you but before you be through with that he nod at my paper you will say 've bring you something fresh "inspector macdonald have be stare at the newcomer with the great amazement well this fairly beat i he cry at last if you be mr. john douglas of birlstone manor then whose death have we be investigate for these two day and where in the world have you spring from now you seem to i to come out of the floor like jack in box ""ah mr. mac say holmes shake reprove forefinger you would not read that excellent local compilation which describe the concealment of king charles people do not hide in those day without excellent hiding place and the hiding place that have once be use may be again have persuade myself that we should find mr. douglas under this roof ""and how long have you be play this trick upon we mr. holmes say the inspector angrily how long have you allow we to waste ourselves upon search that you know to be an absurd one?""not one instant my dear mr. mac only last night do form my view of the case as they could not be put to the proof until this evening invite you and your colleague to take holiday for the day pray what more could do when find the suit of clothe in the moat it at once become apparent to i that the body we have find could not have be the body of mr. john douglas at all but must be that of the bicyclist from tunbridge wells no other conclusion be possible therefore have to determine where mr. john douglas himself could be and the balance of probability be that with the connivance of his wife and his friend he be conceal in house which have such convenience for fugitive and await quieter time when he could make his final escape ""well you figure it out about right say douglas approvingly think 'd dodge your british law for be not sure how stand under it and also see my chance to throw these hound once for all off my track mind you from first to last have do nothing to be ashamed of and nothing that would not do again but you 'll judge that for yourself when tell you my story never
