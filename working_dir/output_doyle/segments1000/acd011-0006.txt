more in those room on baker street where this like so many other wonderful happening will find its end it be the fourth of february in the year 1875 it have be severe winter and the snow lie deep in the gorge of the gilmerton mountains the steam plough have however keep the railroad open and the evening train which connect the long line of coal mining and iron work settlement be slowly groan its way up the steep gradient which lead from stagville on the plain to vermissa the central township which lie at the head of vermissa valley from this point the track sweep downward to bartons crossing helmdale and the purely agricultural county of merton it be single track railroad but at every siding and they be numerous long line of truck pile with coal and iron ore tell of the hidden wealth which have bring rude population and bustling life to this most desolate corner of the united states of america for desolate it be little could the first pioneer who have traverse it have ever imagine that the fair prairie and the most lush water pasture be valueless compare to this gloomy land of black crag and tangled forest above the dark and often scarcely penetrable wood upon their flank the high bare crown of the mountain white snow and jagged rock tower upon each flank leave long winding tortuous valley in the centre up this the little train be slowly crawl the oil lamp have just be light in the lead passenger car long bare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people be seat the great number of these be workman return from their day 's toil in the low part of the valley at least dozen by their grimed face and the safety lantern which they carry proclaim themselves miner these sit smoke in group and converse in low voice glance occasionally at two man on the opposite side of the car whose uniform and badge show they to be policeman several woman of the labour class and one or two traveller who might have be small local storekeeper make up the rest of the company with the exception of one young man in corner by himself it be with this man that we be concerned take good look at he for he be worth it he be fresh complexion middle sized young man not far one would guess from his thirtieth year he have large shrewd humorous gray eye which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he look round through his spectacle at the people about he it be easy to see that he be of sociable and possibly simple disposition anxious to be friendly to all man anyone could pick he at once as gregarious in his habit and communicative in his nature with quick wit and ready smile and yet the man who study he more closely might discern certain firmness of jaw and grim tightness about the lip which would warn he that there be depth beyond and that this pleasant brown haired young irishman might conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon any society to which he be introduce having make one or two tentative remark to the near miner and receive only short gruff reply the traveller resign himself to uncongenial silence stare moodily out of the window at the fade landscape it be not cheer prospect through the grow gloom there pulse the red glow of the furnace on the side of the hill great heap of slag and dump of cinder loom up on each side with the high shaft of the colliery tower above they huddle group of mean wooden house the window of which be begin to outline themselves in light be scatter here and there along the line and the frequent halting place be crowd with their swarthy inhabitant the iron and coal valley of the vermissa district be no resort for the leisured or the cultured everywhere there be stern sign of the crudest battle of life the rude work to be do and the rude strong worker who do it the young traveller gaze out into this dismal country with face of mingle repulsion and interest which show that the scene be new to he at interval he draw from his pocket bulky letter to which he refer and on the margin of which he scribble some note once from the back of his waist he produce something which one would hardly have expect to find in the possession of so mild mannered man it be navy revolver of the large size as he turn it slantwise to the light the glint upon the rim of the copper shell within the drum show that it be fully load he quickly restore it to his secret pocket but not before it have be observe by work man who have seat himself upon the adjoining bench "hullo mate say he you seem heeled and ready "the young man smile with an air of embarrassment "yes say he we need they sometimes in the place

mcmurdo be leave once again to his thought night have now fall and the flame of the frequent furnace be roar and leap in the darkness against their lurid background dark figure be bend and strain twisting and turning with the motion of winch or of windlass to the rhythm of an eternal clank and roar "i guess hell must look something like that say voice mcmurdo turn and see that one of the policeman have shift in his seat and be stare out into the fiery waste "for that matter say the other policeman allow that hell must be something like that if there be bad devil down yonder than some

at the dauntless demeanour of the newcomer while the two policeman shrug their shoulder and renew conversation between themselves few minute later the train run into the ill light station and there be general clearing for vermissa be by far the large town on the line mcmurdo pick up his leather gripsack and be about to start off into the darkness when one of the miner accost he "by gar mate you

night from the other miner as they pass from the platform before ever he have set foot in it mcmurdo the turbulent have become character in vermissa the country have be place of terror but the town be in its way even more depressing down that long valley there be at least certain gloomy grandeur in the huge fire and the cloud of drift smoke while the strength and industry of man find fitting monument in the hill which he have spill by the side of his monstrous excavation but the town show dead level of mean ugliness and squalor the broad street be churn up by the traffic into horrible rut paste of muddy snow the sidewalk be narrow and uneven the numerous gas lamp serve only to show more clearly long line of wooden house each with its veranda face the street unkempt and dirty as they approach the centre of the town the scene be brighten by row of well light store and even more by cluster of saloon and gaming house in which the miner spend their hard earn but generous wage "that be
