thing say mcmurdo 'll go right now and fix it you can tell your father that 'll sleep here to night and find some other quarter in the morning "the bar of mcginty 's saloon be crowd as usual for it be the favourite loafing place of all the rougher element of the town the man be popular for he have rough jovial disposition which form mask cover great deal which lie behind it but apart from this popularity the fear in which he be hold throughout the township and indeed down the whole thirty mile of the valley and past the mountain on each side of it be enough in itself to fill his bar for none could afford to neglect his good will besides those secret power which it be universally believe that he exercise in so pitiless fashion he be high public official municipal councillor and commissioner of road elect to the office through the vote of the ruffian who in turn expect to receive favour at his hand assessment and taxis be enormous the public work be notoriously neglect the account be slur over by bribe auditor and the decent citizen be terrorize into pay public blackmail and hold his tongue lest some bad thing befall he thus it be that year by year boss mcginty 's diamond pin become more obtrusive his gold chain more weighty across more gorgeous vest and his saloon stretch far and far until it threaten to absorb one whole side of the market square mcmurdo push open the swinge door of the saloon and make his way amid the crowd of man within through an atmosphere blur with tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirit the place be brilliantly light and the huge heavily gilt mirror upon every wall reflect and multiply the garish illumination there be several bartender in their shirt sleeve hard at work mixing drink for the lounger who fringe the broad brass trim counter at the far end with his body rest upon the bar and cigar stick at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth stand tall strong heavily build man who could be none other than the famous mcginty himself he be black man giant bearded to the cheek bone and with shock of raven hair which fall to his collar his complexion be as swarthy as that of an italian and his eye be of strange dead black which combine with slight squint give they particularly sinister appearance all else in the man his noble proportion his fine feature and his frank bearing fit in with that jovial man to man manner which he affect here one would say be bluff honest fellow whose heart would be sound however rude his outspoken word might seem it be only when those dead dark eye deep and remorseless be turn upon man that he shrink within himself feel that he be face to face with an infinite possibility of latent evil with strength and courage and cunning behind it which make it thousand time more deadly having have good look at his man mcmurdo elbow his way forward with his usual careless audacity and push himself through the little group of courtier who be fawn upon the powerful boss laugh uproariously at the small of his joke the young stranger 's bold gray eye look back fearlessly through their glass at the deadly black one which turn sharply upon he "well young man ca n't call your face to mind ""i'm new here mr. mcginty ""you be not so new that you ca n't give gentleman his proper title ""he 's councillor mcginty young man say voice from the group "i'm

and your soul as fine as your face then 'd ask for nothing well say mcmurdo "by gar you 've get an irish tongue in your head anyhow cry the saloon keeper not quite certain whether to humour this audacious visitor or to stand upon his dignity "so you be good enough to pass my appearance?""sure say mcmurdo "and you be tell to see me?""i be ""and who tell you?""brother scanlan of lodge 341
