good night to you and good night councillor "he leave the bar room but not before he have create local hero mcmurdo 's deed in far chicago have be whisper before he have put off all question with smile as one who do not wish to have greatness thrust upon he but now the thing be officially confirm the bar loafer crowd round he and shake he heartily by the hand he be free of the community from that time on he could drink hard and show little trace of it but that evening have his mate scanlan not be at hand to lead he home the feted hero would surely have spend his night under the bar on saturday night mcmurdo be introduce to the lodge he have think to pass in without ceremony as be an initiate of chicago but there be particular rite in vermissa of which they be proud and these have to be undergo by every postulant the assembly meet in large room reserve for such purpose at the union house some sixty member assemble at vermissa but that by no mean represent the full strength of the organization for there be several other lodge in the valley and other across the mountain on each side who exchange member when any serious business be afoot so that crime might be do by man who be stranger to the locality altogether there be not less than five hundred scatter over the coal district in the bare assembly room the man be gather round long table at the side be second one laden with bottle and glass on which some member of the company be already turn their eye mcginty sit at the head with flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black hair and coloured purple stole round his neck so that he seem to be priest preside over some diabolical ritual to right and leave of he be the high lodge official the cruel handsome face of ted baldwin among they each of these wear some scarf or medallion as emblem of his office they be for the most part man of mature age but the rest of the company consist of young fellow from eighteen to twenty five the ready and capable agent who carry out the command of their senior among the old man be many whose feature show the tigerish lawless soul within but look at the rank and file it be difficult to believe that these eager and open face young fellow be in very truth dangerous gang of murderer whose mind have suffer such complete moral perversion that they take horrible pride in their proficiency at the business and look with deep respect at the man who have the reputation of make what they call clean job "to their contorted nature it have become spirited and chivalrous thing to volunteer for service against some man who have never injure they and whom in many case they have never see in their life the crime commit they quarrel as to who have actually strike the fatal blow and amuse one another and the company by describe the cry and contortion of the murder man at first they have show some secrecy in their arrangement but at the time which this narrative describe their proceeding be extraordinarily open for the repeat failure of the law have prove to they that on the one hand no one would dare to witness against they and on the other they have an unlimited number of stanch witness upon whom they could call and well fill treasure chest from which they could draw the fund to engage the good legal talent in the state in ten long year of outrage there have be no single conviction and the only danger that ever threaten the scowrers lie in the victim himself who however outnumber and take by surprise might and occasionally do leave his mark upon his assailant mcmurdo have be warn that some ordeal lie before he but no one would tell he in what it consist he be lead now into an outer room by two solemn brother through the plank partition he could hear the murmur of many voice from the assembly within once or twice he catch the sound of his own name and he know that they be discuss his candidacy then there enter an inner guard with green and gold sash across his chest "the bodymaster order that he shall be truss blind and enter say he the three of they remove his coat turn up the sleeve of his right arm and finally pass rope round above the elbow and make it fast they next place thick black cap right over his head and the upper part of his face so that he could see nothing he be then lead into the assembly hall it be pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood he hear the rustle and murmur of the people round he and then the voice of mcginty sound dull and distant through the covering of his ear "john mcmurdo say the voice be you already member of the ancient order of freemen?"he bow in assent "is your lodge no 29 chicago?"he bow again "dark night be unpleasant say the voice "yes for stranger to travel he answer "the cloud be heavy ""yes storm be approach ""are the brother satisfied ask the bodymaster there be general murmur of assent "we know brother by your sign and by your countersign that you be indeed one of we say mcginty we would have you know however that in this county and in other county of these part we have certain rite and also certain duty of our own which call for good man be you ready to be tested?""i be ""are you of stout heart?""i am ""take stride forward to prove it "as the word be say he feel two hard point in front of his eye press upon they so that it appear as if he could not move forward without danger of lose they none the less he nerve himself to step resolutely out and as he do so the pressure melt away there be low murmur of applause "he be of stout heart say the voice can you bear pain?""as well as another he answer "test him!"it be all he could do to keep himself from scream out for an agonizing pain shoot through his forearm he nearly faint at the sudden shock of it but he bite his lip and clench his hand to hide his agony "i can take more than that say he this time there be loud applause fine first appearance have never be make in the lodge hand clap he on the back and the hood be pluck from his head he stand blink and smile amid the congratulation of the brother "one last word brother mcmurdo say mcginty you have already swear the oath of secrecy and fidelity and you be aware that the punishment for any breach of it be instant and inevitable death?""i am say mcmurdo "and you accept the rule of the bodymaster for the time be under all circumstances?""i do ""then in the name of lodge 341 vermissa welcome you to its privilege and debate you will put the liquor on the table brother scanlan and we will drink to our worthy brother "mcmurdo 's coat have be bring to he but before put it on he examine his right arm which still smart heavily there on the flesh of the forearm be circle with triangle within it deep and red as the brand iron have leave it one or two of his neighbour pull up their sleeve and show their own lodge mark "we've all have it say one but not all as brave as you over it ""tut it be nothing say he but it burn and ache all the same when the drink which follow the ceremony of initiation have all be disposed of the business of the lodge proceed mcmurdo accustom only to the prosaic performance of chicago listen with open ear and more surprise than he venture to show to what follow "the first business on the agenda paper say mcginty be to read the follow letter from division master windle of merton county lodge 249 he says:"dear sir:"there be job to be do on andrew rae of rae sturmash coal owner near this place you will remember that your lodge owe we return having have the service of two brother in the matter of the patrolman last fall you will send two

we when we have have occasion to ask for the loan of man or two and it be not for we to refuse he mcginty pause and look round the room with his dull malevolent eye who will volunteer for the job?"several young fellow
