organization in this state have bind themselves together for our destruction and that at this very moment there be pinkerton detective one birdy edwards at work in the valley collect the evidence which may put rope round the neck of many of we and send every man in this room into felon 's cell that be the situation for the discussion of which have make claim of urgency "there be dead silence in the room it be break by the chairman "what be your evidence for this brother mcmurdo he ask "it be in this letter which have come into my hand say mcmurdo he read the passage aloud it be matter of

know he by sight ask mcginty "yes say mcmurdo do "there be murmur of astonishment through the hall "i believe we hold he in the hollow of our hand he continue with an exulting smile upon his face if we act quickly and wisely we can cut this thing short if have your confidence and your help it be little that we have to fear ""what have we to fear anyhow what can he know of our affairs?""you might say so if all be as stanch as you councillor but this man have all the million of the capitalist at his back do you think there be no weak brother among all our lodge that could not be buy he will get

trusty committee mr. chairman yourself if might suggest it and brother baldwin here and five more then can talk freely of what know and of what advise should be do "the proposition be at once adopt and the committee choose besides the chairman and baldwin there be the vulture faced secretary harraway tiger cormac the brutal young assassin carter the treasurer and the brother willaby fearless and desperate man who would stick at nothing the usual revelry of the lodge be short and subdue for there be cloud upon the man 's spirit and many there for the first time begin to see the cloud of avenge law drift up in that serene sky under which they have dwell so long the horror they have deal out to other have be so much part of their settle life that the thought of retribution have become remote one and so seem the more startling now that it come so closely upon they they break up early and leave their leader to their council "now mcmurdo say mcginty when they be alone the seven man sit freeze in their seat "i say just now that know birdy edwards mcmurdo explain need not tell you that he be not here under that name he be brave man but not crazy one he pass under the name of steve wilson and he be lodge at hobson 's patch ""how do you know this?""because fall into talk with he think little of it at the time nor would have give it second thought but for this letter but now be sure it be the man meet he on the car when go down the line on wednesday hard case if ever there be one he say he be reporter believe it for the moment want to know all he could about the scowrers and what he call the outrage for new york paper ask i every kind of question so as to get something you bet be give nothing away 'd pay for it and pay well say he if could get some stuff that would suit my editor say what think would please he well and he hand i twenty dollar bill for my information there be ten time that for you say he if you can find i all that want '""what do you tell he then?""any stuff could make up ""how do you know he be n't newspaper man?""i'll tell you he get out at hobson 's patch and so do i. chance into the telegraph bureau and he be leave it "'see here say the operator after he have go out guess we should charge double rate for this guess you should say i. he have fill the form with stuff that might have be chinese for all we could make of it he fire sheet of this off every day say the clerk yes say it be special news for his paper and he be scared that the other should tap it that be what the operator think and what think at the time but think differently now ""by gar believe you be right say mcginty but what do you allow that we should do about it?""why not go right down now and fix he someone suggest "ay the soon the well ""i'd start this next minute if know where we could find he say mcmurdo he be in hobson 's patch but do n't know the house 've get plan though if you 'll only take my advice ""well what be it?""i'll go to the patch to morrow morning 'll find he through the operator he can locate he guess well then 'll tell he that be freeman myself 'll offer he all the secret of the lodge for price you bet he 'll tumble to it 'll tell he the paper be at my house and that it be as much as my life would be worth to let he come while folk be about he 'll see that that be horse sense let he come at ten o'clock at night and he shall see everything that will fetch he sure ""well?""you can plan the rest for yourself widow macnamara 's be lonely house she be as true as steel and as deaf as post there be only scanlan and i in the house if get his promise and 'll let you know if do 'd have the whole seven of you come to i by nine o'clock we 'll get he in if ever he get out alive well he can talk of birdy edwards 's luck for the rest of his days!""there be go to be vacancy at pinkerton 's or be mistaken leave it at that mcmurdo at nine to morrow we 'll be with you you once get the door shut behind he and you can leave the rest with we "as mcmurdo have say the house in which he live be lonely one and very well suited for such crime as they have plan it be on the extreme fringe of the town and stand well back from the road in any other case the conspirator would have simply call out their man as they have many time before and empty their pistol into his body but in this instance it be very necessary to find out how much he know how he know it and what have be pass on to his employer it be possible that they be already too late and that the work have be do if that be indeed so they could at least have their revenge upon the man who have do it but they be hopeful that nothing of great importance have yet come to the detective 's knowledge as otherwise they argue he would not have trouble to write down and forward such trivial information as mcmurdo claim to have give he however all this they would learn from his own lip once in their power they would find way to make he speak it be not the first time that they have handle an unwilling witness mcmurdo go to hobson 's patch as agree the police seem to take particular interest in he that morning and captain marvin he who have claim the old acquaintance with he at chicago actually address he as he wait at the station mcmurdo turn away and refuse to speak with he he be back from his mission in the afternoon and see mcginty at the union house "he be come he say "good say mcginty the giant be in his shirt sleeve with chain and seal gleam athwart his ample waistcoat and diamond twinkle through the fringe of his bristle beard drink and politic have make the boss very rich as well as powerful man the more terrible therefore seem that glimpse of the prison or the gallow which have rise before he the night before "do you reckon he know much he ask anxiously mcmurdo shake his head gloomily he be be here some time six week at the least guess he do n't come into these part to look at the prospect if he have be work among we all that time with the railroad money at his back should expect that he have get result and that he have pass they on ""there be not weak man in the lodge cry mcginty true as steel every man of they and yet by the lord there be that skunk morris what about he if any man give we away it would be he 've mind to send couple of the boy round before evening to give he beating up and see what they can get from he ""well there would be no harm in that mcmurdo answer wo n't deny that have liking for morris and would be sorry to see he come to harm he have speak to i once or twice over lodge matter and though he may not see they the same as you or he never seem the sort that squeal but still it be not for i to stand between he and you ""i'll fix the old devil say mcginty with an oath 've have my eye on he this year past ""well you know good about that mcmurdo answer but whatever you do must be to morrow for we must lie low until the pinkerton affair be settle up we ca n't afford to set the police buzzing to day of all day ""true for you say mcginty and we 'll learn from birdy edwards himself where he get his news if we have to cut his heart out first do he seem to scent trap?"mcmurdo laughed guess take he on his weak point he say if he could get on good trail of the scowrers he be ready to follow it into hell take his money mcmurdo grin as he produce wad of dollar note and as much more when he have see all my paper ""what papers?""well there be no paper but fill he up about constitution and book of rule and form of membership he expect to get right down to the end of everything before he leave ""faith he be right there say mcginty grimly do n't he ask you why you do n't bring he the papers?""as if would carry such thing and i suspect man and captain marvin after speak to i this very day at the depot!""ay hear of that say mcginty guess the heavy end of this business be come on to you we could put he down an old shaft when we 've do with he but however we work it we ca n't get past the man live at hobson 's patch and you be there to day "mcmurdo shrug his shoulder if we handle it right they can never prove the killing say he no one can see he come to the house after dark and 'll lay to it that no one will see he go now see here councillor 'll show you my plan and 'll ask you to fit the other into it you will all come in good time very well he come at ten he be to tap three time and i to open the door for he then 'll get behind he and shut it he be our man then ""that be all easy and plain ""yes but the next step want consider he be hard proposition he be heavily armed 've fool he proper and yet he be likely to be on his guard suppose show he right into room with seven man in it where he expect to find i alone there be go to be shoot and somebody be go to be hurt ""that be so ""and the noise be go to bring every damned copper in the township on top of it ""i guess you be right ""this be how should work it you will all be in the big room same as you see when you have chat with i 'll open the door for he show he into the parlour beside the door and leave he there while get the paper that will give i the chance of tell you how thing be shape then will go back to he with some fake paper as he be read they will jump for he and get my grip on his pistol arm you 'll hear i call and in you will rush the quick the well for he be as strong man as and may have more than can manage but allow that can hold he till you come ""it be good plan say mcginty the lodge will owe you debt for this guess when move out of the chair can put name to the man that be come after i ""sure councillor be little more than recruit say mcmurdo but his face show what he think of the great man 's compliment when he have return home he make his own preparation for the grim evening in front of he first he clean oil and load his smith wesson revolver then he survey the room in which the detective be to be trap it be large apartment with long deal table in the centre and the big stove at one side at each of the other side be window there be no shutter on these only light curtain which draw across mcmurdo examine these attentively no doubt it must have strike he that the apartment be very expose for so secret meeting yet its distance from the road make it of less consequence finally he discuss the matter with his fellow lodger scanlan though scowrer be an inoffensive little man who be too weak to stand against the opinion of his comrade but be secretly horrify by the deed of blood at which he have sometimes be force to assist mcmurdo tell he shortly what be intend "and if be you mike scanlan would take night off and keep clear of it there will be bloody work here before morning ""well indeed then mac scanlan answer it be not the will but the nerve that be want in i when see manager dunn go down at the colliery yonder it be just more than could stand be not make for it same as you or mcginty if the lodge will think none the bad of i 'll just do as you advise and leave you to yourself for the evening "the man come in good time as arrange they be outwardly respectable citizen well clad and cleanly but judge of face would have read little hope for birdy edwards in those hard mouth and remorseless eye there be not man in the room whose hand have not be redden dozen time before they be as harden to human murder as butcher to sheep foremost of course both in appearance and in guilt be the formidable boss harraway the secretary be lean bitter man with long scraggy neck and nervous jerky limb man of incorruptible fidelity where the finance of the order be concern and with no notion of justice or honesty to anyone beyond the treasurer carter be middle aged man with an impassive rather sulky expression and yellow parchment skin he be capable organizer and the actual detail of nearly every outrage have spring from his plot brain the two willabys be man of action tall lithe young fellow with determined face while their companion tiger cormac heavy dark youth be fear even by his own comrade for the ferocity of his disposition these be the man who assemble that night under the roof of mcmurdo for the killing of the pinkerton detective their host have place whisky upon the table and they have hasten to prime themselves for the work before they baldwin and cormac be already half drunk and the liquor have bring out all their ferocity cormac place his hand on the stove for an instant it have be light for the night be still cold "that will do say he with an oath "ay say baldwin catch his meaning if he be strapped to that we will have the truth out of he ""we'll have the truth out of he never fear say mcmurdo he have nerve of steel this man for though the whole weight of the affair be on he his manner be as cool and unconcerned as ever the other mark it and applaud "you be the one to handle he say the boss approvingly not warning will he get till your hand be on his throat it be pity there be no shutter to your window "mcmurdo go from one to the other and draw the curtain tight sure no one can spy upon we now it be close upon the hour ""maybe he wo n't come maybe he 'll get sniff of danger say the secretary "he'll come never fear mcmurdo answer he be as eager to come as you can be to see he hark to that!"they all sit like wax figure some with their glass arrest halfway to their lip three loud knock have sound at the door "hush mcmurdo raise his hand in caution an exulting glance go round the circle and hand be lay upon their weapon "not sound for your life mcmurdo whisper as he go from the room close the door carefully behind he with strained ear the murderer wait they count the step of their comrade down the passage then they hear he open the outer door there be few word as of greeting then they be aware of strange step inside and of an unfamiliar voice an instant later come the slam of the door and the turning of the key in the lock their prey be safe within the trap tiger cormac laugh horribly and boss mcginty clap his great hand across his mouth "be quiet you fool he whisper you 'll be the undoing of we yet!"there be mutter of conversation from the next room it seem interminable then the door open and mcmurdo appear his finger upon his lip he come to the end of the table and look round at they subtle change have come over he his manner be as of one who have great work to do his face have set into granite firmness his eye shine with fierce excitement behind his spectacle he have become visible leader of man they stare at he with eager
