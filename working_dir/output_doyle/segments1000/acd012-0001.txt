fellah that be what be amiss with you say lord john think you be queer from the first ""your habit sir have not mend in these three year say summerlee shake his head also do not fail to observe your strange manner the moment we meet you need not waste your sympathy lord john these tear be purely alcoholic the man have be drink by the way lord john call you coxcomb just now which be perhaps unduly severe but the word remind i of small accomplishment trivial but amusing which use to possess you know i as the austere man of science can you believe that once have well deserve reputation in several nursery as farmyard imitator perhaps can help you to pass the time in pleasant way would it amuse you to hear i crow like cock?""no sir say lord john who be still greatly offended it wouldnotamuse i ""my imitation of the clucking hen who have just lay an egg be also consider rather above the average might venture?""no sir no certainly not "but in spite of this earnest prohibition professor summerlee lay down his pipe and for the rest of our journey he entertain or fail to entertain we by succession of bird and animal cry which seem so absurd that my tear be suddenly change into boisterous laughter which must have become quite hysterical as sit opposite this grave professor and see he or rather hear he in the character of the uproarious rooster or the puppy whose tail have be tread upon once lord john pass across his newspaper upon the margin of which he have write in pencil poor devil mad as hatter no doubt it be very eccentric and yet the performance strike i as extraordinarily clever and amusing whilst this be go on lord john lean forward and tell i some interminable story about buffalo and an indian rajah which seem to i to have neither beginning nor end professor summerlee have just begin to chirrup like canary and lord john to get to the climax of his story when the train draw up at jarvis brook which have be give we as the station for rotherfield and there be challenger to meet we his appearance be glorious not all the turkey cock in creation could match the slow high step dignity with which he parade his own railway station and the benignant smile of condescend encouragement with which he regard everybody around he if he have change in anything since the day of old it be that his point have become accentuated the huge head and broad sweep of forehead with its plastered lock of black hair seem even great than before his black beard pour forward in more impressive cascade and his clear grey eye with their insolent and sardonic eyelid be even more masterful than of yore he give i the amused hand shake and encouraging smile which the head master bestow upon the small boy and having greet the other and help to collect their bag and their cylinder of oxygen he stow we and they away in large motor car which be drive by the same impassive austin the man of few word whom have see in the character of butler upon the occasion of my first eventful visit to the professor our journey lead we up wind hill through beautiful country sit in front with the chauffeur but behind i my three comrade seem to i to be all talk together lord john be still struggle with his buffalo story so far as could make out while once again hear as of old the deep rumble of challenger and the insistent accent of summerlee as their brain lock in high and fierce scientific debate suddenly austin slant his mahogany face toward i without take his eye from his steering wheel "i'm under notice say he "dear i say i.everything seem strange to day everyone say queer unexpected thing it be like dream "it 's forty seven time say austin reflectively "when do you go ask for want of some well observation "i do n't go say austin the conversation seem to have end there but presently he come back to it "if be to go who would look after he jerk his head toward his master who would get to serve im?""someone else suggest lamely "not e. no one would

and the missus would be like two babe leave out in bundle be just everything and then go and give i notice ""why would no one stay ask "well they would n't make allowance same as do be very clever man the master so clever that 's clean balmy sometimes 've see right off be onion and no error well look what do this morning ""what do he do?"austin bent over to i "'e bit the ousekeeper say he in hoarse whisper "bit her?""yes sir bit er on the leg see er with my own eye startin marathon from the all door ""good gracious!""so you 'd say sir if you could see some of the going on do n't make friend with the neighbor there be some of they think that when be up among those monster you write about it be just '' ome sweet ome for the master and be never in fitter company that be whattheysay but 've serve ten year and be fond of and mind you be great man when all be say an do and it be an honor to serve m. but do try one cruel at time now look at that sir that ai n't what you might call old fashioned ospitality be it now just you read it for yourself "the car on its low speed have grind its way up steep curve ascent at the corner notice board peer over well clip hedge as austin say it be not difficult to read for the word be few and arrest \+ \+ warning visitor pressmen and mendicants be not encourage g. e. challenger \+ \+"no it be not what you might call earty say austin shake his head and glance up at the deplorable placard it would n't look well in christmas card beg your pardon sir for have n't speak as much as this for many long year but to day my feeling seem to ave get the well of i can sack i till 's blue in the face but ai n't go and that be flat be be man and be my master and so it will be expect to the end of the chapter "we have pass between the white post of gate and up curve drive line with rhododendron bush beyond stand low brick house pick out with white woodwork very comfortable and pretty mrs. challenger small dainty smile figure stand in the open doorway to welcome we "well my dear say challenger bustle out of the car here be our visitor it be something new for we to have visitor be it not no love lose between we and our neighbor be there if they could get rat poison into our baker 's cart expect it would be there ""it be dreadful dreadful cry the lady between laughter and tear george be always quarrel with everyone we have n't friend on the countryside ""it enable i to concentrate my attention upon my incomparable wife say challenger pass his short thick arm round her waist picture gorilla and gazelle and you have the pair of they come come these gentleman be tired from the journey and luncheon should be ready have sarah returned?"the lady shake her head ruefully and the professor laugh loudly and stroke his beard in his masterful fashion "austin he cry when you have put up the car you will kindly help your mistress to lay the lunch now gentleman will you please step into my study for there be one or two very urgent thing which be anxious to say to you "as we cross the hall the telephone bell rang and we be the involuntary auditor of professor challenger 's end of the ensue dialogue say we but no one within hundred yard could have fail to hear the booming of that monstrous voice which reverberate through the house his answer linger in my mind "yes yes of course it be .... yes certainly theprofessor challenger the famous professor who else ... of course every word of it otherwise should not have write it .... should n't be surprised .... there be every indication of it .... within day or so at the furth .... well ca n't help that can ... very unpleasant no doubt but rather fancy it will affect more important people than you there be no use whine about it .... no could n't possibly you must take your chance .... that be enough sir nonsense have something more important to do than to listen to such twaddle "he shut off with crash and lead we upstairs into large airy apartment which form his study on the great mahogany desk seven or eight unopened telegram be lie "really he say as he gather they up begin to think that it would save my correspondent money if be to adopt telegraphic address possibly noah rotherfield would be the most appropriate "as usual when he make an obscure joke he lean against the desk and bellow in paroxysm of laughter his hand shake so that he could hardly open the envelope "noah noah he gasp with face of beetroot while lord john and smile in sympathy and summerlee like dyspeptic goat wag his head in sardonic disagreement finally challenger still rumble and explode begin to open his telegram the three of we stand in the bow window and occupy ourselves in admire the magnificent view it be certainly worth look at the road in its gentle curve have really bring we to considerable elevation seven hundred foot as we afterwards discover challenger 's house be on the very edge of the hill and from its southern face in which be the study window one look across the vast stretch of the weald to where the gentle curve of the south downs form an undulating horizon in cleft of the hill haze of smoke mark the position of lewes immediately at our foot there lie rolling plain of heather with the long vivid green stretch of the crowborough golf course all dot with the player little to the south through an opening in the wood we could see section of the main line from london to brighton in the immediate foreground under our very nose be small enclose yard in which stand the car which have bring we from the station an ejaculation from challenger cause we to turn he have read his telegram and have arrange they in little methodical pile upon his desk his broad rugged face or as much of it as be visible over the matted beard be still deeply flushed and he seem to be under the influence of some strong excitement "well gentleman he say in voice as if he be address public meeting this be indeed an interesting reunion and it take place under extraordinary may say unprecedented circumstance may ask if you have observe anything upon your journey from town?""the only thing which observe say summerlee with sour smile be that our young friend here have not improve in his manner during the year that have pass be sorry to state that have have to seriously complain of his conduct in the train and should be want in frankness if do not say that it have leave most unpleasant impression in my mind ""well well we all get bit prosy sometimes say lord john the young fellah mean no real harm after all he be an international so if he take half an hour to describe game of football he have more right to do it than most folk ""half an hour to describe game cry indignantly why it be you that take half an hour with some long wind story about buffalo professor summerlee will be my witness ""i can hardly judge which of you be the most utterly wearisome say summerlee declare to you challenger that never wish to hear of football or of buffalo so long as live ""i have never say one word to day about football protest lord john give shrill whistle and summerlee shake his head sadly "so early in the day too say he it be indeed deplorable as sit there in sad but thoughtful silence in silence cry lord john why you be doin' music hall turn of imitation all the way more like runaway gramophone than man "summerlee draw himself up in bitter protest "you be pleased to be facetious lord john say he with face of vinegar "why dash it all this be clear madness cry lord john each of we seem to know what the other do and none of we know what he do himself let 's put it all together from the first we get into first class smoker that be clear ai n't it then we begin to quarrel over friend challenger 's letter in the times ""oh you do do you rumble our host his eyelid begin to droop "you say summerlee that there be no possible truth in his contention ""dear i say challenger puff out his chest and stroke his beard no possible truth seem to have hear the word before and may ask with what argument the great and famous professor summerlee proceed to demolish the humble individual who have venture to express an opinion upon matter of scientific possibility perhaps before he exterminate that unfortunate nonentity he will condescend to give some reason for the adverse view which he have form "he bow and shrug and spread open his hand as he speak with his elaborate and elephantine sarcasm "the reason be simple enough say the dog summerlee contend that if the ether surround the earth be so toxic in one quarter that it produce dangerous symptom it be hardly likely that we three in the railway carriage should be entirely unaffected "the explanation only bring uproarious merriment from challenger he laugh until everything in the room seem to rattle and quiver "our worthy summerlee be not for the first time somewhat out of touch with the fact of the situation say he at last mop his heated brow now gentleman can not make my point well than by detail to you what have myself do this morning you will the more easily condone any mental aberration upon your own part when you realize that even have have moment when my balance have be disturb we have have for some year in this household housekeeper one sarah with whose second name have never attempt to burden my memory she be woman of severe and forbid aspect prim and demure in her bearing very impassive in her nature and never know within our experience to show sign of any emotion as sit alone at my breakfast mrs. challenger be in the habit of keep her room of morning it suddenly enter my head that it would be entertaining and instructive to see whether could find any limit to this woman 's inperturbability devise simple but effective experiment having upset small vase of flower which stand in the centre of the cloth ring the bell and slip under the table she enter and see the room empty imagine that have withdraw to the study as have expect she approach and lean over the table to replace the vase have vision of cotton stocking and an elastic sided boot protrude my head sink my tooth into the calf of her leg the experiment be successful beyond belief for some moment she stand paralyzed stare down at my head then with shriek she tear herself free and rush from the room pursue she with some thought of an explanation but she fly down the drive and some minute afterwards be able to pick she out with my field glass travel very rapidly in south westerly direction tell you the anecdote for what it be worth drop it into your brain and await its germination be it illuminative have it convey anything to your mind what doyouthink of it lord john?"lord john shake his head gravely "you'll be gettin into serious trouble some of these day if you do n't put brake on say he "perhap you have some observation to make summerlee?""you should drop all work instantly challenger and take three month in german watering place say he "profound profound cry challenger now my young friend be it possible that wisdom may come from you where your senior have so signally failed?"and it do say it with all modesty but it do of course it all seem obvious enough to you who know what occur but it be not so very clear when everything be new but it come on i suddenly with the full force of absolute conviction "poison cry then even as say the word my mind flash back over the whole morning 's experience past lord john with his buffalo past my own hysterical tear past the outrageous conduct of professor summerlee to the queer happening in london the row in the park the driving of the chauffeur the quarrel at the oxygen warehouse everything fit suddenly into its place "of course cry again it be poison we be all poison ""exactly say challenger rub his hand we be all poison our planet have swum into the poison belt of ether and be now fly deeply into it at the rate of some million of mile minute our young friend have express the cause of all our trouble and perplexity in single word poison '"we look at each other in amazed silence no comment seem to meet the situation "there be mental inhibition by which such symptom can be check and control say challenger can not expect to find it develop in all of you to the same point which it have reach in i for suppose that the strength of our different mental process bear some proportion to each other but no doubt it be appreciable even in our young friend here after the little outburst of high spirit which so alarm my domestic sit down and reason with myself put it to myself that have never before felt impel to bite any of my household the impulse have then be an abnormal one in an instant perceive the truth my pulse upon examination be ten beat above the usual and my reflex be increase call upon my high and saner self the real g. e. c. seat serene and impregnable behind all mere molecular disturbance summon he say to watch the foolish mental trick which the poison would play find that be indeed the master could recognize and control disorder mind it be remarkable exhibition of the victory of mind over matter for it be victory over that particular form of matter which be most intimately connect with mind might almost say that mind be at fault and that personality control it thus when my wife come downstairs and be impel to slip behind the door and alarm she by some wild cry as she enter be able to stifle the impulse and to greet she with dignity and restraint an overpower desire to quack like duck be meet and master in the same fashion "later when descend to order the car and find austin bend over it absorb in repair control my open hand even after have lift it and refrain from give he an experience which would possibly have cause he to follow in the step of the housekeeper on the contrary touch he on the shoulder and order the car to be at the door in time to meet your train at the present instant be most forcibly tempt to take professor summerlee by that silly old beard of his and to shake his head violently backwards and forwards and yet as you see be perfectly restrain let i commend my example to you ""i'll look out for that buffalo say lord john "and for the football match ""it may be that you be right challenger say summerlee in chastened voice be willing to admit that my turn of mind be critical rather than constructive and that be not ready convert to any new theory especially when it happen to be so unusual and fantastic as this one however as cast my mind back over the event of the morning and as reconsider the fatuous conduct of my companion find it easy to believe that some poison of an exciting kind be responsible for their symptom "challenger slap his colleague good humouredly upon the shoulder we progress say he decidedly we progress ""and pray sir ask summerlee humbly what be your opinion as to the present outlook?""with your permission will say few word upon that subject he seat himself upon his desk his short stumpy leg swinge in front of he we be assist at tremendous and awful function it be in my opinion the end of the world "the end of the world our eye turn to the great bow window and we look out at the summer beauty of the country side the long slope of heather the great country house the cozy farm the pleasure seeker upon the link the end of the world one have often hear the word but the idea that they could ever have an immediate practical significance that it should not be at some vague date but now to day that be tremendous staggering thought we be all strike solemn and wait in silence for challenger to continue his overpower presence and appearance lend such force to the solemnity of his word that for moment all the crudity and absurdity of the man vanish and he loom before we as something majestic and beyond the range of ordinary humanity then to i at least there come back the cheering recollection of how twice since we have enter the room he have roar with laughter surely think there be limit to mental detachment the crisis can not be so great or so press after all "you will conceive bunch of grape say he which be cover by some infinitesimal but noxious bacillus the gardener pass it through disinfecting medium it may be that he desire his grape to be clean it may be that he need space to breed some fresh bacillus less noxious than the last he dip it into the poison and they be go our gardener be in my opinion about to dip the solar system and the human bacillus the little mortal vibrio which twist and wriggle upon the outer rind of the earth will in an instant be sterilize out of existence "again there be silence it be break by the high trill of the telephone bell "there be one of our bacilli squeaking for help say he with grim smile they be begin to realize that their continued existence be not really one of the necessity of the universe "he be go from the room for minute or two remember that none of we speak in his absence the situation seem beyond all word or comment "the medical officer of health for brighton say he when he return the symptom be for some reason develop more rapidly upon the sea level our
