seven hundred foot of elevation give we an advantage folk seem to have learn that be the first authority upon the question no doubt it come from my letter in the times that be the mayor of provincial town with whom talk when we first arrive you may have hear i upon the telephone he seem to put an entirely inflated value upon his own life help he to readjust his idea "summerlee have rise and be stand by the window his thin bony hand be tremble with his emotion "challenger say he earnestly this thing be too serious for mere futile argument do not suppose that desire to irritate you by any question may ask but put it to you whether there may not be some fallacy in your information or in your reasoning there be the sun shine as brightly as ever in the blue sky there be the heather and the flower and the bird there be the folk enjoy themselves upon the golf link and the laborer yonder cut the corn you tell we that they and we may be upon the very brink of destruction that this sunlit day may be that day of doom which the human race have so long await so far as we know you find this tremendous judgment upon what upon some abnormal line in spectrum upon rumour from sumatra upon some curious personal excitement which we have discern in each other this latter symptom be not so marked but that you and we could by deliberate effort control it you need not stand on ceremony with we challenger we have all face death together before now speak out and let we know exactly where we stand and what in your opinion be our prospect for our future "it be brave good speech speech from that stanch and strong spirit which lie behind all the acidity and angularity of the old zoologist lord john rise and shake he by the hand "my sentiment to tick say he now challenger it be up to you to tell we where we be we ai n't nervous folk as you know well but when it come to makin week end visit and find you 've run full butt into the day of judgment it want bit of explainin what be the danger and how much of it be there and what be we goin' to do to meet it?"he stand tall and strong in the sunshine at the window with his brown hand upon the shoulder of summerlee be lie back in an armchair an extinguished cigarette between my lip in that sort of half daze state in which impression become exceedingly distinct it may have be new phase of the poisoning but the delirious prompting have all pass away and be succeed by an exceedingly languid and at the same time perceptive state of mind be spectator it do not seem to be any personal concern of mine but here be three strong man at great crisis and it be fascinating to observe they challenger bend his heavy brow and stroke his beard before he answer one could see that he be very carefully weigh his word "what be the last news when you leave london he ask "i be at the gazette office about ten say i. there be reuter just come in from singapore to the effect that the sickness seem to be universal in sumatra and that the lighthouse have not be light in consequence ""events have be move somewhat rapidly since then say challenger pick up his pile of telegram be in close touch both with the authority and with the press so that news be converge upon i from all part there be in fact general and very insistent demand that should come to london but see no good end to be serve from the account the poisonous effect begin with mental excitement the rioting in paris this morning be say to have be very violent and the welsh collier be in state of uproar so far as the evidence to hand can be trust this stimulative stage which vary much in race and in individual be succeed by certain exaltation and mental lucidity seem to discern some sign of it in our young friend here which after an appreciable interval turn to coma deepen rapidly into death fancy so far as my toxicology carry i that there be some vegetable nerve poison datura suggest summerlee "excellent cry challenger it would make for scientific precision if we name our toxic agent let it be daturon to you my dear summerlee belong the honour posthumous alas but none the less unique of having give name to the universal destroyer the great gardener 's disinfectant the symptom of daturon then may be take to be such as indicate that it will involve the whole world and that no life can possibly remain behind seem to i to be certain since ether be universal medium up to now it have be capricious in the place which it have attack but the difference be only matter of few hour and it be like an advance tide which cover one strip of sand and then another run hither and thither in irregular stream until at last it have submerge it all there be law at work in connection with the action and distribution of daturon which would have be of deep interest have the time at our disposal permit we to study they so far as can trace they here he glance over his telegram the less develop race have be the first to respond to its influence there be deplorable account from africa and the australian aborigine appear to have be already exterminate the northern race have as yet show great resist power than the southern this you see be date from marseilles at nine forty five this morning give it to you verbatim all night delirious excitement throughout provence tumult of vine grower at nimes socialistic upheaval at toulon sudden illness attend by coma attack population this morning peste foudroyante great number of dead in the street paralysis of business and universal chaos '"an hour later come the following from the same source we be threaten with utter extermination cathedral and church full to overflowing the dead outnumber the living it be inconceivable and horrible decease seem to be painless but swift and inevitable '"there be similar telegram from paris where the development be not yet as acute india and persia appear to be utterly wipe out the slavonic population of austria be down while the teutonic have hardly be affect speak generally the dweller upon the plain and upon the seashore seem so far as my limited information go to have feel the effect more rapidly than those inland or on the height even little elevation make considerable difference and perhaps if there be survivor of the human race he will again be find upon the summit of some ararat even our own little hill may presently prove to be temporary island amid sea of disaster but at the present rate of advance few short hour will submerge we all "lord john roxton wipe his brow "what beat i say he be how you could sit there laughin with that stack of telegram under your hand 've see death as often as most folk but universal death it be awful!""as to the laughter say challenger you will bear in mind that like yourself have not be exempt from the stimulating cerebral effect of the etheric poison but as to the horror with which universal death appear to inspire you would put it to you that it be somewhat exaggerated if you be send to sea alone in an open boat to some unknown destination your heart might well sink within you the isolation the uncertainty would oppress you but if your voyage be make in goodly ship which bear within it all your relation and your friend you would feel that however uncertain your destination might still remain you would at least have one common and simultaneous experience which would hold you to the end in the same close communion lonely death may be terrible but universal one as painless as this would appear to be be not in my judgment matter for apprehension indeed could sympathize with the person who take the view that the horror lie in the idea of survive when all that be learn famous and exalted have pass away ""what then do you propose to do ask summerlee who have for once nod his assent to the reasoning of his brother scientist "to take our lunch say challenger as the boom of gong sound through the house we have cook whose omelette be only excel by her cutlet we can but trust that no cosmic disturbance have dull her excellent ability my scharzberger of 96 must also be rescue so far as our earnest and united effort can do it from what would be deplorable waste of great vintage he lever his great bulk off the desk upon which he have sit while he announce the doom of the planet come say he if there be little time leave there be the more need that we should spend it in sober and reasonable enjoyment "and indeed it prove to be very merry meal it be true that we could not forget our awful situation the full solemnity of the event loom ever at the back of our mind and temper our thought but surely it be the soul which have never face death which shy strongly from it at the end to each of we man it have for one great epoch in our life be familiar presence as to the lady she lean upon the strong guidance of her mighty husband and be well content to go whither his path might lead the future be our fate the present be our own we pass it in goodly comradeship and gentle merriment our mind be as have say singularly lucid even strike spark at time as to challenger he be wonderful never have so realize the elemental greatness of the man the sweep and power of his understanding summerlee draw he on with his chorus of subacid criticism while lord john and laugh at the contest and the lady her hand upon his sleeve control the bellowing of the philosopher life death fate the destiny of man these be the stupendous subject of that memorable hour make vital by the fact that as the meal progress strange sudden exaltation in my mind and tingling in my limb proclaim that the invisible tide of death be slowly and gently rise around we once see lord john put his hand suddenly to his eye and once summerlee drop back for an instant in his chair each breath we breathe be charge with strange force and yet our mind be happy and at ease presently austin lay the cigarette upon the table and be about to withdraw "austin say his master "yes sir?""i thank you for your faithful service smile steal over the servant 's gnarl face "i've do my duty sir ""i'm expect the end of the world to day austin ""yes sir what time sir?""i ca n't say austin before evening ""very good sir "the taciturn austin salute and withdraw challenger light cigarette and draw his chair close to his wife 's he take her hand in his "you know how matter stand dear say he have explain it also to our friend here you be not afraid be you?""it wo n't be painful george?""no more than laugh gas at the dentist 's every time you have have it you have practically die ""but that be pleasant sensation ""so may death be the worn out bodily machine ca n't record its impression but we know the mental pleasure which lie in dream or trance nature may build beautiful door and hang it with many gauzy and shimmer curtain to make an entrance to the new life for our wonder soul in all my probing of the actual have always find wisdom and kindness at the core and if ever the frightened mortal need tenderness it be surely as he make the passage perilous from life to life no summerlee will have none of your materialism for at least be too great thing to end in mere physical constituent packet of salt and three bucketful of water here here and he beat his great head with his huge hairy fist there be something which use matter but be not of it something which might destroy death but which death can never destroy ""talkin of death say lord john be christian of sort but it seem to i there be somethin' mighty natural in those ancestor of our who be bury with their axis and bow and arrow and the like same as if they be livin on just the same as they use to do n't know he add look round the table in shamefaced way that would n't feel more homely myself if be put away with my old .450 express and the fowlin'-piece the short one with the rubber stock and clip or two of cartridge just fool 's fancy of course but there it be how do it strike you herr professor?""well say summerlee since you ask my opinion it strike i as an indefensible throwback to the stone age or before it be of the twentieth century myself and would wish to die like reasonable civilized man do n't know that be more afraid of death than the rest of you for be an oldish man and come what may ca n't have very much long to live but it be all against my nature to sit wait without struggle like sheep for the butcher be it quite certain challenger that there be nothing we can do?""to save we nothing say challenger to prolong our life few hour and thus to see the evolution of this mighty tragedy before we be actually involve in it that may prove to be within my power have take certain step the oxygen?""exactly the oxygen ""but what can oxygen effect in the face of poisoning of the ether there be not great difference in quality between brick bat and gas than there be between oxygen and ether they be different plane of matter they can not impinge upon one another come challenger you could not defend such proposition ""my good summerlee this etheric poison be most certainly influence by material agent we see it in the method and distribution of the outbreak we should nota priorihave expect it but it be undoubtedly fact hence be strongly of opinion that gas like oxygen which increase the vitality and the resist power of the body would be extremely likely to delay the action of what you have so happily name the daturon it may be that be mistaken but have every confidence in the correctness of my reasoning ""well say lord john if we 've get to sit suckin at those tube like so many baby with their bottle be not takin any ""there will be no need for that challenger answer we have make arrangement it be to my wife that you chiefly owe it that her boudoir shall be make as airtight as be practicable with matting and varnish paper ""good heaven challenger you do n't suppose you can keep out ether with varnish paper?""really my worthy friend you be trifle perverse in miss the point it be not to keep out the ether that we have go to such trouble it be to keep in the oxygen trust that if we can ensure an atmosphere hyper oxygenate to certain point we may be able to retain our sense have two tube of the gas and you have bring i three more it be not much but it be something ""how long will they last?""i have not an idea we will not turn they on until our symptom become unbearable then we shall dole the gas out as it be urgently need it may give we some hour possibly even some day on which we may look out upon blasted world our own fate be delay to that extent and we will have the very singular experience we five of be in all probability the absolute rear guard of the human race upon its march into the unknown perhaps you will be kind enough now to give i hand with the cylinder it seem to i that the atmosphere already grow somewhat more oppressive "the chamber which be destine to be the scene of our unforgettable experience be charmingly feminine sitting room some fourteen or sixteen foot square at the end of it divide by curtain of red velvet be small apartment which form the professor 's dressing room this in turn open into large bedroom the curtain be still hang but the boudoir and dressing room could be take as one chamber for the purpose of our experiment one door and the window frame have be plaster round with varnish paper so as to be practically seal above the other door which open on to the landing there hang fanlight which could be draw by cord when some ventilation become absolutely necessary large shrub in tub stand in each corner "how to get rid of our excessive carbon dioxide without unduly waste our oxygen be delicate and vital question say challenger look round he after the five iron tube have be lay side by side against the wall with long time for preparation could have bring the whole concentrated force of my intelligence to bear more fully upon the problem but as it be we must do what we can the shrub will be of some small service two of the oxygen tube be ready to be turn on at an instant 's notice so that we can not be take unawares at the same time it would be well not to go far from the room as the crisis may be sudden and urgent one "there be broad low window opening out upon balcony the view beyond be the same as that which we have already admire from the study look out could see no sign of disorder anywhere there be road curve down the side of the hill under my very eye cab from the station one of those prehistoric survival which be only to be find in our country village be toil slowly up the hill lower down be nurse girl wheel perambulator and lead second child by the hand the blue reek of smoke from the cottage give the whole widespread landscape an air of settle order and homely comfort nowhere in the blue heaven or on the sunlit earth be there any foreshadowing of catastrophe the harvester be back in the field once more and the golfer in pair and four be still stream round the link there be so strange turmoil within my own head and such jangling of my overstrung nerve that the indifference of those people be amazing "those fellow do n't seem to feel any ill effect say point down at the link "have you play golf ask lord john "no have not ""well young fellah when you do you 'll learn that once fairly out on round it would take the crack of doom to stop true golfer halloa there be that telephone bell again "from time to time during and after lunch the high insistent ring have summon the professor he give we the news as it come through to he in few curt sentence such terrific item have never be register in the world 's history before the great shadow be creep up from the south like rise tide of death egypt have go through its delirium and be now comatose spain and portugal after wild frenzy in which the clericals and the anarchist have fight most desperately be now fall silent no cable message be receive any long from south america in north america the southern state after some terrible racial rioting have succumb to the poison north of maryland the effect be not yet mark and in canada it be hardly perceptible belgium holland and denmark have each in turn be affect despairing message be flash from every quarter to the great centre of learning to the chemist and the doctor of world wide repute implore their advice the astronomer too be deluge with inquiry nothing could be do the thing be universal and beyond our human knowledge or control it be death painless but inevitable death for young and old for weak and strong for rich and poor without hope or possibility of escape such be the news which in scatter distracted message the telephone have bring we the great city already know their fate and so far as we could gather be prepare to meet it with dignity and resignation yet here be our golfer and laborer like the lamb who gambol under the shadow of the knife it seem amazing and yet how could they know it have all come upon we in one giant stride what be there in the morning paper to alarm they and now it be but three in the afternoon even as we look some rumour seem to have spread for we see the reaper hurry from the field some of the golfer be return to the club house they be run as if take refuge from shower their little caddie trail behind they other be continue their game the nurse have turn and be push

one huge vault of unbroken blue save for few fleecy white cloud over the distant down if the human race must die to day it be at least upon glorious death bed and yet all that gentle loveliness of nature make this terrific and wholesale destruction the more pitiable and awful surely it be too goodly residence that we should be so swiftly so ruthlessly evict from it!but have say that the telephone bell have ring once more suddenly hear challenger 's tremendous voice from the hall "malone he cry you be want "i rush down to the instrument it be mcardle speak from london "that you mr. malone cry his familiar voice mr. malone there be terrible going on in london for god 's sake see if professor challenger can suggest anything that can be do ""he can suggest nothing sir answer he regard the crisis as universal and inevitable we have some oxygen here but it can only defer our fate for few hour ""oxygen cry the agonized voice there be no time to get any the office have be perfect pandemonium ever since you leave in the morning now half of the staff be insensible be weigh down with heaviness myself from my window can see the people lie thick in fleet street the traffic be all hold up judge by the last telegram the whole world his voice have be sink and suddenly stop an instant later hear through the telephone muffled thud as if his head have fall forward on the desk
