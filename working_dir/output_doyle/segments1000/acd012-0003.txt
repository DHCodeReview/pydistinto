back unable to speak or move on the boudoir carpet the woman lie beside i and summerlee be bunch in chair by the window his head nearly touch his knee as in dream see challenger like monstrous beetle crawl slowly across the floor and moment later hear the gentle hissing of the escape oxygen challenger breathe two or three time with enormous gulp his lung roar as he draw in the vital gas "it work he cry exultantly my reasoning have be justify he be up on his foot again alert and strong with tube in his hand he rush over to his wife and hold it to her face in few second she moan stir and sit up he turn to i and feel the tide of life steal warmly through my artery my reason tell i that it be but little respite and yet carelessly as we talk of its value every hour of existence now seem an inestimable thing never have know such thrill of sensuous joy as come with that freshet of life the weight fall away from my lung the band loosen from my brow sweet feeling of peace and gentle languid comfort steal over i lie watch summerlee revive under the same remedy and finally lord john take his turn he spring to his foot and give i hand to rise while challenger pick up his wife and lay she on the settee "oh george be so sorry you bring i back she say hold he by the hand the door of death be indeed as you say hang with beautiful shimmering curtain for once the choking feeling have pass it be all unspeakably soothing and beautiful why have you drag i back?""because wish that we make the passage together we have be together so many year it would be sad to fall apart at the supreme moment "for moment in his tender voice catch glimpse of new challenger something very far from the bullying rant arrogant man who have alternately amazed and offend his generation here in the shadow of death be the innermost challenger the man who have win and hold woman 's love suddenly his mood change and he be our strong captain once again "alone of all mankind see and foretell this catastrophe say he with ring of exultation and scientific triumph in his voice as to you my good summerlee trust your last doubt have be resolve as to the meaning of the blurring of the line in the spectrum and that you will no long contend that my letter in the times be base upon delusion "for once our pugnacious colleague be deaf to challenge he could but sit gasp and stretch his long thin limb as if to assure himself that he be still really upon this planet challenger walk across to the oxygen tube and the sound of the loud hissing fall away till it be the most gentle sibilation "we must husband our supply of the gas say he the atmosphere of the room be now strongly hyperoxygenate and take it that none of we feel any distressing symptom we can only determine by actual experiment what amount add to the air will serve to neutralize the poison let we see how that will do "we sit in silent nervous tension for five minute or more observe our own sensation have just begin to fancy that feel the constriction round my temple again when mrs. challenger call out from the sofa that she be faint her husband turn on more gas "in pre scientific day say he they use to keep white mouse in every submarine as its more delicate organization give sign of vicious atmosphere before it be perceive by the sailor you my dear will be our white mouse have now increase the supply and you be well ""yes be well ""possibly we have hit upon the correct mixture when we have ascertain exactly how little will serve we shall be able to compute how long we shall be able to exist unfortunately in resuscitate ourselves we have already consume considerable proportion of this first tube ""does it matter ask lord john who be stand with his hand in his pocket close to the window if we have to go what be the use of holdin on you do n't suppose there be any chance for us?"challenger smile and shake his head "well then do n't you think there be more dignity in takin the jump and not waitin to be push in if it must be so be for sayin our prayer turnin off the gas and openin the window ""why not say the lady bravely surely george lord john be right and it be well so ""i most strongly object cry summerlee in querulous voice when we must die let we by all mean die but to deliberately anticipate death seem to i to be foolish and unjustifiable action ""what do our young friend say to it ask challenger "i think we should see it to the end ""and be strongly of the same opinion say he "then george if you say so think so too cry the lady "well well be only puttin it as an argument say lord john if you all want to see it through be with you it be dooced interestin and no mistake about that 've have my share of adventure in my life and as many thrill as most folk but be endin on my top note ""grante the continuity of life say challenger "a large assumption cry summerlee challenger stare at he in silent reproof "grante the continuity of life say he in his most didactic manner none of we can predicate what opportunity of observation one may have from what we may call the spirit plane to the plane of matter it surely must be evident to the most obtuse person here he glare summerlee that it be while we be ourselves material that we be most fit to watch and form judgment upon material phenomenon therefore it be only by keep alive for these few extra hour that we can hope to carry on with we to some future existence clear conception of the most stupendous event that the world or the universe so far as we know it have ever encounter to i it would seem deplorable thing that we should in any way curtail by so much as minute so wonderful an experience ""i be strongly of the same opinion cry summerlee "carrie without division say lord john by george that poor devil of chauffeur of your down in the yard have make his last journey no use makin sally and bringin he in?""it would be absolute madness cry summerlee "well suppose it would say lord john it could n't help he and would scatter our gas all over the house even if we ever get back alive my word look at the little bird under the trees!"we draw four chair up to the long low window the lady still rest with closed eye upon the settee remember that the monstrous and grotesque idea cross my mind the illusion may have be heighten by the heavy stuffiness of the air which we be breathe that we be in four front seat of the stall at the last act of the drama of the world in the immediate foreground beneath our very eye be the small yard with the half clean motor car standing in it austin the chauffeur have receive his final notice at last for he be sprawl beside the wheel with great black bruise upon his forehead where it have strike the step or mud guard in fall he still hold in his hand the nozzle of the hose with which he have be wash down his machine couple of small plane tree stand in the corner of the yard and underneath they lie several pathetic little ball of fluffy feather with tiny foot uplifted the sweep of death 's scythe have include everything great and small within its swath over the wall of the yard we look down upon the winding road which lead to the station group of the reaper whom we have see run from the field be lie all pell mell their body cross each other at the bottom of it far up the nurse girl lie with her head and shoulder prop against the slope of the grassy bank she have take the baby from the perambulator and it be motionless bundle of wrap in her arm close behind she tiny patch upon the roadside show where the little boy be stretch still near to we be the dead cab horse kneel between the shaft the old driver be hang over the splash board like some grotesque scarecrow his arm dangle absurdly in front of he through the window we could dimly discern that young man be seat inside the door be swinge open and his hand be grasp the handle as if he have attempt to leap forth at the last instant in the middle distance lie the golf link dot as they have be in the morning with the dark figure of the golfer lie motionless upon the grass of the course or among the heather which skirt it on one particular green there be eight body stretch where foursome with its caddie have hold to their game to the last no bird fly in the blue vault of heaven no man or beast move upon the vast countryside which lie before we the evening sun shine its peaceful radiance across it but there brood over it all the stillness and the silence of universal death death in which we be so soon to join at the present instant that one frail sheet of glass by hold in the extra oxygen which counteract the poison ether shut we off from the fate of all our kind for few short hour the knowledge and foresight of one man could preserve our little oasis of life in the vast desert of death and save we from participation in the common catastrophe then the gas would run low we too should lie gasp upon that cherry colour boudoir carpet and the fate of the human race and of all earthly life would be complete for long time in mood which be too solemn for speech we look out at the tragic world "there be house on fire say challenger at last point to column of smoke which rise above the tree there will expect be many such possibly whole city in flame when we consider how many folk may have drop with light in their hand the fact of combustion be in itself enough to show that the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere be normal and that it be the ether which be at fault ah there you see another blaze on the top of crowborough hill it be the golf clubhouse or be mistaken there be the church clock chime the hour it would interest our philosopher to know that man make mechanism have survive the race who make it ""by george cry lord john rise excitedly from his chair what be that puff of smoke it be train "we hear the roar of it and presently it came fly into sight go at what seem to i to be prodigious speed whence it have come or how far we have no means of know only by some miracle of luck could it have go any distance but now we be to see the terrific end of its career train of coal truck stand motionless upon the line we hold our breath as the express roar along the same track the crash be horrible engine and carriage pile themselves into hill of splinter wood and twisted iron red spurt of flame flicker up from the wreckage until it be all ablaze for half an hour we sit with hardly word stun by the stupendous sight "poor poor people cry mrs. challenger at last cling with whimper to her husband 's arm "my dear the passenger on that train be no more animate than the coal into which they crash or the carbon which they have now become say challenger stroke her hand soothingly it be train of the living when it leave victoria but it be drive and freight by the dead long before it reach its fate ""all over the world the same thing must be go on say as vision of strange happening rise before i think of the ship at sea how they will steam on and on until the furnace die down or until they run full tilt upon some beach the sailing ship too how they will back and fill with their cargo of dead sailor while their timber rot and their joint leak till one by one they sink below the surface perhaps century hence the atlantic may still be dot with the old drift derelict ""and the folk in the coal mine say summerlee with dismal chuckle if ever geologist should by any chance live upon earth again they will have some strange theory of the existence of man in carboniferous strata ""i do n't profess to know about such thing remark lord john but it seem to i the earth will be to let empty after this when once our human crowd be wipe off it how will it ever get on again?""the world be empty before challenger answer gravely under law which in their inception be beyond and above we it became people why may the same process not happen again?""my dear challenger you ca n't mean that?""i be not in the habit professor summerlee of say thing which do not mean the observation be trivial out go the beard and down come the eyelid "well you live an obstinate dogmatist and you mean to die one say summerlee sourly "and you sir have live an unimaginative obstructionist and never can hope now to emerge from it ""your bad critic will never accuse you of lack imagination summerlee retort "upon my word say lord john it would be like you if you use up our last gasp of oxygen in abuse each other what can it matter whether folk come back or not it surely wo n't be in our time ""in that remark sir you betray your own very pronounced limitation say challenger severely the true scientific mind be not to be tie down by its own condition of time and space it build itself an observatory erect upon the border line of present which separate the infinite past from the infinite future from this sure post it make its sally even to the beginning and to the end of all thing as to death the scientific mind die at its post work in normal and methodic fashion to the end it disregard so petty thing as its own physical dissolution as completely as it do all other limitation upon the plane of matter be right professor summerlee?"summerlee grumble an ungracious assent "with certain reservation agree say he "the ideal scientific mind continue challenger put it in the third person rather than appear to be too self complacent the ideal scientific mind should be capable of think out point of abstract knowledge in the interval between its owner fall from balloon and reach the earth man of this strong fibre be need to form the conqueror of nature and the bodyguard of truth ""it strike i nature be on top this time say lord john look out of the window 've read some leadin article about you gentleman controllin she but she be gettin bit of her own back ""it be but temporary setback say challenger with conviction few million year what be they in the great cycle of time the vegetable world have as you can see survive look at the leave of that plane tree the bird be dead but the plant flourish from this vegetable life in pond and in marsh will come in time the tiny crawl microscopic slug which be the pioneer of that great army of life in which for the instant we five have the extraordinary duty of serve as rear guard once the low form of life have establish itself the final advent of man be as certain as the growth of the oak from the acorn the old circle will swing round once more ""but the poison ask will that not nip life in the bud?""the poison may be mere stratum or layer in the ether mephitic gulf stream across that mighty ocean in which we float or tolerance may be establish and life accommodate itself to new condition the mere fact that with comparatively small hyperoxygenation of our blood we can hold out against it be surely proof in itself that no very great change would be need to enable animal life to endure it "the smoking house beyond the tree have burst into flame we could see the high tongue of fire shoot up into the air "it be pretty awful mutter lord john more impressed than have ever see he "well after all what do it matter remark the world be dead cremation be surely the good burial ""it would shorten we up if this house go ablaze ""i foresaw the danger say challenger and ask my wife to guard against it ""everything be quite safe dear but my head begin to throb again what dreadful atmosphere!""we must change it say challenger he bend over his cylinder of oxygen "it be nearly empty say he it have last we some three and half hour it be now close on eight o'clock we shall get through the night comfortably should expect the end about nine o'clock to morrow morning we shall see one sunrise which shall be all our own "he turn on his second tube and open for half minute the fanlight over the door then as the air become perceptibly well but our own symptom more acute he close it once again "by the way say he man do not live upon oxygen alone it be dinner time and over assure you gentleman that when invite you to my home and to what have hope would be an interesting reunion have intend that my kitchen should justify itself however we must do what we can be sure that you will agree with i that it would be folly to consume our air too rapidly by light an oil stove have some small provision of cold meat bread and pickle which with couple of bottle of claret may serve our turn thank you my dear now as ever you be the queen of manager "it be indeed wonderful how with the self respect and sense of propriety of the british housekeeper the lady have within few minute adorn the central table with snow white cloth lay the napkin upon it and set forth the simple meal with all the elegance of civilization include an electric torch lamp in the centre wonderful also be it to find that our appetite be ravenous "it be the measure of our emotion say challenger with that air of condescension with which he bring his scientific mind to the explanation of humble fact we have go through great crisis that mean molecular disturbance that in turn mean the need for repair great sorrow or great joy should bring intense hunger not abstinence from food as our novelist will have it ""that be why the country folk have great feast at funeral hazard "exactly our young friend have hit upon an excellent illustration let i give you another slice of tongue ""the same with savage say lord john cut away at the beef 've see they buryin chief up the aruwimi river and they eat hippo that must have weigh as much as tribe there be some of they down new guinea way that eat the late lament himself just by way of last tidy up well of all the funeral feast on this earth suppose the one we be takin be the queer ""the strange thing be say mrs. challenger that find it impossible to feel grief for those who be go there be my father and mother at bedford know that they be dead and yet in this tremendous universal tragedy can feel no sharp sorrow for any individual even for they ""and my old mother in her cottage in ireland say i. can see she in my mind 's eye with her shawl and her lace cap lie back with closed eye in the old high back chair near the window her glass and her book beside she why should mourn she she have pass and be pass and may be nearer she in some other life than england be to ireland yet grieve to think that that dear body be no more ""as to the body remark challenger we do not mourn over the paring of our nail nor the cut lock of our hair though they be once part of ourselves neither do one legged man yearn sentimentally over his miss member the physical body have rather be source of pain and fatigue to we it be the constant index of our limitation why then should we worry about its detachment from our psychical selves?""if they can indeed be detach summerlee grumble but anyhow universal death be dreadful ""as have already explain say challenger universal death must in its nature be far less terrible than isolated one ""same in battle remark lord john if you see single man lie on that floor with his chest knock in and hole in his face it would turn you sick but 've see ten thousand on their back in the soudan and it give i no such feelin for when you be makin history the life of any man be too small thing to worry over when thousand million pass over together same as happen to day you ca n't pick your own partic'lar out of the crowd ""i wish it be well over with we say the lady wistfully oh george be so frightened ""you'll be the brave of we all little lady when the time come 've be blusterous old husband to you dear but you 'll just bear in mind that g. e. c. be as he be make and could n't help himself after all you would n't have have anyone else?""no one in the whole wide world dear say she and put her arm round his bull neck we three walk to the window and stand amazed at the sight which meet our eye darkness have fall and the dead world be shroud in gloom but right across the southern horizon be one long vivid scarlet streak wax and wane in vivid pulse of life leap suddenly to crimson zenith and then die down to glowing line of fire "lewes be ablaze!""no it be brighton which be burn say challenger step across to join we you can see the curved back of the down against the glow that fire be mile on the farther side of it the whole town must be alight "there be several red glare at different point and the pile ofdebrisupon the railway line be still smolder darkly but they all seem mere pin point of light compare to that monstrous conflagration throbbing beyond the hill what copy it would have make for the gazette have ever journalist such an opening and so little chance of use it the scoop of scoop and no one to appreciate it and then suddenly the old instinct of recording come over i if these man of science could be so true to their life 's work to the very end why should not in my humble way be as constant no human eye might ever rest upon what have do but the long night have to be pass somehow and for i at least sleep seem to be out of the question my note would help to pass the weary hour and to occupy my thought thus it be that now have before i the notebook with its scribbled page write confusedly upon my knee in the dim wane light of our one electric torch have the literary touch they might have be worthy of the occasion as it be they may still serve to bring to other mind the long draw emotion and tremor of that awful night how strange the word look scribble at the top of the empty page of my book how strange still that it be edward malone who have write they who start only some twelve hour ago from my room in streatham without one thought of the marvel which the day be to bring forth look back at the chain
