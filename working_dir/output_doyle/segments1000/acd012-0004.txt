of incident my interview with mcardle challenger 's first note of alarm in the times the absurd journey in the train the pleasant luncheon the catastrophe and now it have come to this that we linger alone upon an empty planet and so sure be our fate that can regard these line write from mechanical professional habit and never to be see by human eye as the word of one who be already dead so closely do he stand to the shadow borderland over which all outside this one little circle of friend have already go feel how wise and true be the word of challenger when he say that the real tragedy would be if we be leave behind when all that be noble and good and beautiful have pass but of that there can surely be no danger already our second tube of oxygen be draw to an end we can count the poor dreg of our life almost to minute we have just be treat to lecture good quarter of an hour long from challenger who be so excited that he roar and bellow as if he be address his old row of scientific sceptic in the queen 's hall he have certainly strange audience to harangue his wife perfectly acquiescent and absolutely ignorant of his meaning summerlee seat in the shadow querulous and critical but interested lord john lounge in corner somewhat bore by the whole proceeding and myself beside the window watch the scene with kind of detach attention as if it be all dream or something in which have no personal interest whatever challenger sit at the centre table with the electric light illuminate the slide under the microscope which he have bring from his dressing room the small vivid circle of white light from the mirror leave half of his rugged bearded face in brilliant radiance and half in deep shadow he have it seem be work of late upon the low form of life and what excite he at the present moment be that in the microscopic slide make up the day before he find the amoeba to be still alive "you can see it for yourself he keep repeat in great excitement summerlee will you step across and satisfy yourself upon the point malone will you kindly verify what say the little spindle shape thing in the centre be diatom and may be disregard since they be probably vegetable rather than animal but the right hand side you will see an undoubted amoeba move sluggishly across the field the upper screw be the fine adjustment look at it for yourself "summerlee do so and acquiesced so do and perceive little creature which look as if it be make of ground glass flow in sticky way across the light circle lord john be prepared to take he on trust "i'm not troublin my head whether he be alive or dead say he we do n't so much as know each other by sight so why should take it to heart do n't suppose he be worryin himself over the state ofourhealth "i laugh at this and challenger look in my direction with his cold and most supercilious stare it be most petrifying experience "the flippancy of the half educate be more obstructive to science than the obtuseness of the ignorant say he if lord john roxton would condescend my dear george do n't be so peppery say his wife with her hand on the black mane that droop over the microscope what can it matter whether the amoeba be alive or not?""it matter great deal say challenger gruffly "well let 's hear about it say lord john with good humoured smile we may as well talk about that as anything else if you think 've be too off hand with the thing or hurt its feelin be in any way 'll apologize ""for my part remark summerlee in his creaky argumentative voice ca n't see why you should attach such importance to the creature be alive it be in the same atmosphere as ourselves so naturally the poison do not act upon it if it be outside of this room it would be dead like all other animal life ""your remark my good summerlee say challenger with enormous condescension oh if could paint that over bearing arrogant face in the vivid circle of reflection from the microscope mirror your remark show that you imperfectly appreciate the situation this speciman be mount yesterday and be hermetically seal none of our oxygen can reach it but the ether of course have penetrate to it as to every other point upon the universe therefore it have survive the poison hence we may argue that every amoeba outside this room instead of be dead as you have erroneously state have really survive the catastrophe ""well even now do n't feel inclined to hip hurrah about it say lord john what do it matter?""it just matter this that the world be living instead of dead one if you have the scientific imagination you would cast your mind forward from this one fact and you would see some few million of year hence mere pass moment in the enormous flux of the age the whole world teem once more with the animal and human life which will spring from this tiny root you have see prairie fire where the flame have sweep every trace of grass or plant from the surface of the earth and leave only blacken waste you would think that it must be forever desert yet the root of growth have be leave behind and when you pass the place few year hence you can no long tell where the black scar use to be here in this tiny creature be the root of growth of the animal world and by its inherent development and evolution it will surely in time remove every trace of this incomparable crisis in which we be now involve ""dooce interestin say lord john lounge across and look through the microscope funny little chap to hang number one among the family portrait got fine big shirt stud on him!""the dark object be his nucleus say challenger with the air of nurse teach letter to baby "well we need n't feel lonely say lord john laugh there be somebody livin besides we on the earth ""you seem to take it for grant challenger say summerlee that the object for which this world be create be that it should produce and sustain human life ""well sir and what object do you suggest ask challenger bristle at the least hint of contradiction "sometimes think that it be only the monstrous conceit of mankind which make he think that all this stage be erect for he to strut upon ""we can not be dogmatic about it but at least without what you have venture to call monstrous conceit we can surely say that we be the high thing in nature ""the high of which we have cognizance ""that sir go without say ""think of all the million and possibly billion of year that the earth swing empty through space or if not empty at least without sign or thought of the human race think of it wash by the rain and scorch by the sun and sweep by the wind for those unnumbered age man only come into be yesterday so far as geological time go why then should it be take for grant that all this stupendous preparation be for his benefit?""for whose then or for what?"summerlee shrug his shoulder "how can we tell for some reason altogether beyond our conception and man may have be mere accident by product evolve in the process it be as if the scum upon the surface of the ocean imagine that the ocean be create in order to produce and sustain it or mouse in cathedral thought that the building be its own proper ordained residence "i have jot down the very word of their argument but now it degenerate into mere noisy wrangle with much polysyllabic scientific jargon upon each side it be no doubt privilege to hear two such brain discuss the high question but as they be in perpetual disagreement plain folk like lord john and get little that be positive from the exhibition they neutralize each other and we be leave as they find we now the hubbub have cease and summerlee be coil up in his chair while challenger still finger the screw of his microscope be keep up continual low deep inarticulate growl like the sea after storm lord john come over to i and we look out together into the night there be pale new moon the last moon that human eye will ever rest upon and the star be most brilliant even in the clear plateau air of south america have never see they bright possibly this etheric change have some effect upon light the funeral pyre of brighton be still blaze and there be very distant patch of scarlet in the western sky which may mean trouble at arundel or chichester possibly even at portsmouth sit and muse and make an occasional note there be sweet melancholy in the air youth and beauty and chivalry and love be this to be the end of it all the starlit earth look dreamland of gentle peace who would imagine it as the terrible golgotha strew with the body of the human race suddenly find myself laugh "halloa young fellah say lord john stare at i in surprise we could do with joke in these hard time what be it then?""i be think of all the great unsolved question answer the question that we spend so much labor and think over think of anglo german competition for example or the persian gulf that my old chief be so keen about whoever would have guess when we fume and fret so how they be to be eventually solved?"we fall into silence again fancy that each of we be think of friend that have go before mrs. challenger be sob quietly and her husband be whisper to she my mind turn to all the most unlikely people and see each of they lie white and rigid as poor austin do in the yard there be mcardle for example know exactly where he be with his face upon his writing desk and his hand on his own telephone just as hear he fall beaumont the editor too suppose he be lie upon the blue and red turkey carpet which adorn his sanctum and the fellow in the reporter room macdona and murray and bond they have certainly die hard at work on their job with note book full of vivid impression and strange happening in their hand could just imagine how this one would have be pack off to the doctor and that other to westminster and yet third to st. paul 's what glorious row of head line they must have see as last vision beautiful never destine to materialize in printer 's ink could see macdona among the doctor hope in harley street mac have always weakness for alliteration interview with mr. soley wilson famous specialist say never despair our special correspondent find the eminent scientist seat upon the roof whither he have retreat to avoid the crowd of terrified patient who have storm his dwelling with manner which plainly show his appreciation of the immense gravity of the occasion the celebrated physician refuse to admit that every avenue of hope have be close that be how mac would start then there be bond he would probably do st. paul 's he fancy his own literary touch my word what theme for he stand in the little gallery under the dome and look down upon that pack mass of despairing humanity grovel at this last instant before power which they have so persistently ignore there rise to my ear from the swaying crowd such low moan of entreaty and terror such shudder cry for help to the unknown that and so forth yes it would be great end for reporter though like myself he would die with the treasure still unused what would bond not give poor chap to see j. h. b. at the foot of column like that?but what drivel be write it be just an attempt to pass the weary time mrs. challenger have go to the inner dressing room and the professor say that she be asleep he be make note and consult book at the central table as calmly as if year of placid work lie before he he write with very noisy quill pen which seem to be screech scorn at all who disagree with he summerlee have drop off in his chair and give from time to time peculiarly exasperating snore lord john lie back with his hand in his pocket and his eye close how people can sleep under such condition be more than can imagine three thirty a.m. have just waken with start it be five minute past eleven when make my last entry remember wind up my watch and note the time so have waste some five hour of the little span still leave to we who would have believe it possible but feel very much fresher and ready for my fate or try to persuade myself that be and yet the fitter man be and the high his tide of life the more must he shrink from death how wise and how merciful be that provision of nature by which his earthly anchor be usually loosen by many little imperceptible tug until his consciousness have drift out of its untenable earthly harbor into the great sea beyond!mrs challenger be still in the dressing room challenger have fall asleep in his chair what picture his enormous frame lean back his huge hairy hand be clasp across his waistcoat and his head be so tilt that can see nothing above his collar save tangled bristle of luxuriant beard he shake with the vibration of his own snoring summerlee add his occasional high tenor to challenger 's sonorous bass lord john be sleep also his long body double up sideways in basket chair the first cold light of dawn be just steal into the room and everything be grey and mournful look out at the sunrise that fateful sunrise which will shine upon an unpeopled world the human race be go extinguish in day but the planet swing round and the tide rise or fall and the wind whisper and all nature go her way down as it would seem to the very amoeba with never sign that he who style himself the lord of creation have ever bless or curse the universe with his presence down in the yard lie austin with sprawl limb his face glimmer white in the dawn and the hose nozzle still project from his dead hand the whole of human kind be typify in that one half ludicrous and half pathetic figure lie so helpless beside the machine which it use to control here end the note which make at the time henceforward event be too swift and too poignant to allow i to write but they be too clearly outline in my memory that any detail could escape i some chokiness in my throat make i look at the oxygen cylinder and be startled at what see the sand of our life be run very low at some period in the night challenger have switch the tube from the third to the fourth cylinder now it be clear that this also be nearly exhausted that horrible feeling of constriction be close in upon i run across and unscrew the nozzle change it to our last supply even as do so my conscience prick i for feel that perhaps if have hold my hand all of they might have pass in their sleep the thought be banish however by the voice of the lady from the inner room cry george george be stifling!""it be all right mrs. challenger answer as the other start to their foot have just turn on fresh supply "even at such moment could not help smile at challenger who with great hairy fist in each eye be like huge bearded baby new waken out of sleep summerlee be shiver like man with the ague human fear as he realize his position rise for an instant above the stoicism of the man of science lord john however be as cool and alert as if he have just be rouse on hunting morning "fifthly and lastly say he glance at the tube say young fellah do n't tell i you 've be writin up your impression in that paper on your knee ""just few note to pass the time ""well do n't believe anyone but an irishman would have do that expect you 'll have to wait till little brother amoeba gets grow up before you 'll find reader he do n't seem to take much stock of thing just at present well herr professor what be the prospects?"challenger be look out at the great drift of morning mist which lie over the landscape here and there the woode hill rise like conical island out of this woolly sea "it might be wind sheet say mrs. challenger who have enter in her dressing gown there be that song of your george ring out the old ring in the new it be prophetic but you be shiver my poor dear friend have be warm under coverlet all night and you cold in your chair but 'll soon set you right "the brave little creature hurry away and presently we hear the sizzling of kettle she be back soon with five steaming cup of cocoa upon tray "drink these say she you will feel so much well "and we do summerlee ask if he might light his pipe and we all have cigarette it steady our nerve think but it be mistake for it make dreadful atmosphere in that stuffy room challenger have to open the ventilator "how long challenger ask lord john "possibly three hour he answer with shrug "i use to be frightened say his wife but the nearer get to it the easy it seem do n't you think we ought to pray george?""you will pray dear if you wish the big man answer very gently we all have our own way of pray mine be complete acquiescence in whatever fate may send i cheerful acquiescence the high religion and the high science seem to unite on that ""i can not truthfully describe my mental attitude as acquiescence and far less cheerful acquiescence grumble summerlee over his pipe submit because have to confess that should have like another year of life to finish my classification of the chalk fossil ""your unfinished work be small thing say challenger pompously when weigh against the fact that my ownmagnum opus the ladder of life be still in the first stage my brain my reading my experience in fact my whole unique equipment be to be condense into that epoch make volume and yet as say acquiesce ""i expect we 've all leave some loose end stickin out say lord john what be yours young fellah?""i be work at book of verse answer "well the world have escape that anyhow say lord john there be always compensation somewhere if you grope around ""what about you ask "well it just so happen that be tidy up and ready have promise merivale to go to tibet for snow leopard in the spring but it be hard on you mrs. challenger when you have just build up this pretty home ""where george be there be my home but oh what would not give for one last walk together in the fresh morning air upon those beautiful downs!"our heart re echo her word the sun have burst through the gauzy mist which veil it and the whole broad weald be wash in golden light sit in our dark and poisonous atmosphere that glorious clean wind sweep countryside seem very dream of beauty mrs. challenger hold her hand stretch out to it in her longing we draw up chair and sit in semicircle in the window the atmosphere be already very close it seem to i that the shadow of death be draw in upon we the last of our race it be like an invisible curtain close down upon every side "that cylinder be not lastin too well say lord john with long gasp for breath "the amount contain be variable say challenger depend upon the pressure and care with which it have be bottle be inclined to agree with you roxton that this one be defective ""so we be to be cheat out of the last hour of our life summerlee remark bitterly an excellent final illustration of the sordid age in which we have live well challenger now be your time if you wish to study the subjective phenomena of physical dissolution ""sit on the stool at my knee and give i your hand say challenger to his wife think my friend that further delay in this insufferable atmosphere be hardly advisable you would not desire it dear would you?"his wife give little groan and sink her face against his leg "i've see the folk bathin in the serpentine in winter say lord john when the rest be in you see one or two shiverin on the bank envyin the other that have take the plunge it be the last that have the bad of it be all for header and have do with it ""you would open the window and face the ether?""better be poison than stifle "summerlee nod his reluctant acquiescence and hold out his thin hand to challenger "we've have our quarrel in our time but that be all over say he we be good friend and have respect for each other under the surface good by!""good by young fellah say lord john the window 's plaster up you ca n't open it "challenger stoop and raise his wife press she to his breast while she throw her arm round his neck "give i that field glass malone say he gravely hand it to he "into the hand of the power that make we we render ourselves again he shout in his voice of thunder and at the word he hurl the field glass through the window full in our flushed face before the last tinkle of fall fragment have die away there come the wholesome breath of the wind blow strong and sweet do n't know how long we sit in amazed silence then as in dream hear challenger 's voice once more "we be back in normal condition he cry the world have clear the poison belt but we alone of all mankind be save "i remember that we all sit gasp in our chair with that sweet wet south western breeze fresh from the sea flap the muslin curtain and cool our flushed face wonder how long we sit none of we afterwards could agree at all on that point we be bewildered stunned semi conscious we have all brace our courage for death but this fearful and sudden new fact that we must continue to live after we have survive the race to which we belong strike we with the shock of physical blow and leave we prostrate then gradually the suspend mechanism begin to move once more the shuttle of memory work idea weave themselves together in our mind we see with vivid merciless clearness the relation between the past the present and the future the life that we have lead and the life which we would have to live our eye turn in silent horror upon those of our companion and find the same answering look in theirs instead of the joy which man might have be expect to feel who have so narrowly escape an imminent death terrible wave of darkest depression submerge we everything on earth that we love have be wash away into the great infinite unknown ocean and here be we maroon upon this desert island of world without companion hope or aspiration few year skulk like jackal among the grave of the human race and then our belated and lonely end would come "it 's dreadful george dreadful the lady cry in an agony of sob if we have only pass with the other oh why do you save we feel as if it be we that be dead and everyone else alive "challenger 's great eyebrow be draw down in concentrated thought while his huge hairy paw close upon the outstretched hand
