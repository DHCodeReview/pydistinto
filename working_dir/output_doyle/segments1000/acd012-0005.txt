of his wife have observe that she always hold out her arm to he in trouble as child would to its mother "without be fatalist to the point of nonresistance say he have always find that the high wisdom lie in an acquiescence with the actual he speak slowly and there be vibration of feeling in his sonorous voice "i donotacquiesce say summerlee firmly "i do n't see that it matter row of pin whether you acquiesce or whether you do n't remark lord john you 've get to take it whether you take it fightin or take it lyin down so what be the odd whether you acquiesce or not?"i ca n't remember that anyone ask our permission before the thing begin and nobody be likely to ask it now so what difference can it make what we may think of it?""it be just all the difference between happiness and misery say challenger with an abstract face still pat his wife 's hand you can swim with the tide and have peace in mind and soul or you can thrust against it and be bruise and weary this business be beyond we so let we accept it as it stand and say no more ""but what in the world be we to do with our life ask appeal in desperation to the blue empty heaven "what be to do for example there be no newspaper so there be an end of my vocation ""and there be nothin' leave to shoot and no more soldierin so there be an end of mine say lord john "and there be no student so there be an end of mine cry summerlee "but have my husband and my house so can thank heaven that there be no end of mine say the lady "nor be there an end of mine remark challenger for science be not dead and this catastrophe in itself will offer we many most absorbing problem for investigation "he have now fling open the window and we be gaze out upon the silent and motionless landscape "let i consider he continue it be about three or little after yesterday afternoon that the world finally enter the poison belt to the extent of be completely submerge it be now nine o'clock the question be at what hour do we pass out from it?""the air be very bad at daybreak say i."later than that say mrs. challenger as late as eight o'clock distinctly feel the same choke at my throat which come at the outset ""then we shall say that it pass just after eight o'clock for seventeen hour the world have be soak in the poisonous ether for that length of time the great gardener have sterilize the human mold which have grow over the surface of his fruit be it possible that the work be incompletely do that other may have survive besides ourselves?""that be what be wonderin say lord john why should we be the only pebble on the beach?""it be absurd to suppose that anyone besides ourselves can possibly have survive say summerlee with conviction consider that the poison be so virulent that even man who be as strong as an ox and have not nerve in his body like malone here could hardly get up the stair before he fall unconscious be it likely that anyone could stand seventeen minute of it far less hours?""unless someone see it come and make preparation same as old friend challenger do ""that think be hardly probable say challenger project his beard and sink his eyelid the combination of observation inference and anticipatory imagination which enable i to foresee the danger be what one can hardly expect twice in the same generation ""then your conclusion be that everyone be certainly dead?""there can be little doubt of that we have to remember however that the poison work from below upwards and would possibly be less virulent in the high strata of the atmosphere it be strange indeed that it should be so but it present one of those feature which will afford we in the future fascinating field for study one could imagine therefore that if one have to search for survivor one would turn one 's eye with good hope of success to some tibetan village or some alpine farm many thousand of foot above the sea level ""well considerin that there be no railroad and no steamer you might as well talk about survivor in the moon say lord john but what be askin myself be whether it be really over or whether it be only half time "summerlee crane his neck to look round the horizon it seem clear and fine say he in very dubious voice but so it do yesterday be by no mean assure that it be all over "challenger shrug his shoulder "we must come back once more to our fatalism say he if the world have undergo this experience before which be not outside the range of possibility it be certainly very long time ago therefore we may reasonably hope that it will be very long before it occur again ""that be all very well say lord john but if you get an earthquake shock you be mighty likely to have second one right on the top of it think we 'd be wise to stretch our leg and have breath of air while we have the chance since our oxygen be exhaust we may just as well be catch outside as in "it be strange the absolute lethargy which have come upon we as reaction after our tremendous emotion of the last twenty four hour it be both mental and physical deep lie feeling that nothing matter and that everything be weariness and profitless exertion even challenger have succumb to it and sit in his chair with his great head lean upon his hand and his thought far away until lord john and catch he by each arm fairly lift he on to his foot receive only the glare and growl of an angry mastiff for our trouble however once we have get out of our narrow haven of refuge into the wide atmosphere of everyday life our normal energy come gradually back to we once more but what be we to begin to do in that graveyard of world could ever man have be face with such question since the dawn of time it be true that our own physical need and even our luxury be assure for the future all the store of food all the vintage of wine all the treasure of art be ours for the taking but what be we to do some few task appeal to we at once since they lie ready to our hand we descend into the kitchen and lay the two domestic upon their respective bed they seem to have die without suffer one in the chair by the fire the other upon the scullery floor then we carry in poor austin from the yard his muscle be set as hard as board in the most exaggerated rigor mortis while the contraction of the fibre have draw his mouth into hard sardonic grin this symptom be prevalent among all who have die from the poison wherever we go we be confront by those grin face which seem to mock at our dreadful position smile silently and grimly at the ill fate survivor of their race "look here say lord john who have pace restlessly about the dining room whilst we partook of some food do n't know how you fellow feel about it but for my part simplycan'tsit here and do nothin' ""perhaps challenger answer you would have the kindness to suggest what you think we ought to do ""get move on we and see all that have happen ""that be what should myself propose ""but not in this little country village we can see from the window all that this place can teach we ""where should we go then?""to london!""that be all very well grumble summerlee you may be equal to forty mile walk but be not so sure about challenger with his stumpy leg and be perfectly sure about myself challenger be very much annoyed "if you could see your way sir to confine your remark to your own physical peculiarity you would find that you have an ample field for comment he cry "i have no intention to offend you my dear challenger cry our tactless friend you ca n't be hold responsible for your own physique if nature have give you short heavy body you can not possibly help have stumpy leg "challenger be too furious to answer he could only growl and blink and bristle lord john hasten to intervene before the dispute become more violent "you talk of walk why should we walk say he "do you suggest take train ask challenger still simmer "what be the matter with the motor car why should we not go in that?""i be not an expert say challenger pull at his beard reflectively at the same time you be right in suppose that the human intellect in its high manifestation should be sufficiently flexible to turn itself to anything your idea be an excellent one lord john myself will drive you all to london ""you will do nothing of the kind say summerlee with decision "no indeed george cry his wife you only try once and you remember how you crash through the gate of the garage ""it be momentary want of concentration say challenger complacently you can consider the matter settle will certainly drive you all to london "the situation be relieve by lord john "what be the car he ask "a twenty horsepower humber ""why 've drive one for year say he by george he add never think 'd live to take the whole human race in one load there be just room for five as remember it get your thing on and 'll be ready at the door by ten o'clock "sure enough at the hour name the car come purr and crackle from the yard with lord john at the wheel take my seat beside he while the lady useful little buffer state be squeeze in between the two man of wrath at the back then lord john release his brake slide his lever rapidly from first to third and we speed off upon the strange drive that ever human being have take since man first come upon the earth you be to picture the loveliness of nature upon that august day the freshness of the morning air the golden glare of the summer sunshine the cloudless sky the luxuriant green of the sussex wood and the deep purple of heather clothe down as you look round upon the many colour beauty of the scene all think of vast catastrophe would have pass from your mind have it not be for one sinister sign the solemn all embrace silence there be gentle hum of life which pervade closely settle country so deep and constant that one cease to observe it as the dweller by the sea lose all sense of the constant murmur of the wave the twitter of bird the buzz of insect the far off echo of voice the lowing of cattle the distant barking of dog roar of train and rattle of cart all these form one low unremitting note strike unheeded upon the ear we miss it now this deadly silence be appalling so solemn be it so impressive that the buzz and rattle of our motor car seem an unwarrantable intrusion an indecent disregard of this reverent stillness which lie like pall over and round the ruin of humanity it be this grim hush and the tall cloud of smoke which rise here and there over the country side from smolder building which cast chill into our heart as we gaze round at the glorious panorama of the weald and then there be the dead at first those endless group of draw and grin face fill we with shudder horror so vivid and mordant be the impression that can live over again that slow descent of the station hill the passing by the nurse girl with the two babe the sight of the old horse on his knee between the shaft the cabman twist across his seat and the young man inside with his hand upon the open door in the very act of spring out lower down be six reaper all in litter their limb crossing their dead unwinke eye gaze upwards at the glare of heaven these thing see as in photograph but soon by the merciful provision of nature the over excite nerve cease to respond the very vastness of the horror take away from its personal appeal individual merge into group group into crowd crowd into universal phenomenon which one soon accept as the inevitable detail of every scene only here and there where some particularly brutal or grotesque incident catch the attention do the mind come back with sudden shock to the personal and human meaning of it all above all there be the fate of the child that remember fill we with the strong sense of intolerable injustice we could have weep mrs. challenger do weep when we pass great council school and see the long trail of tiny figure scatter down the road which lead from it they have be dismiss by their terrified teacher and be speed for their home when the poison catch they in its net great number of people be at the open window of the house in tunbridge wells there be hardly one which have not its stare smile face at the last instant the need of air that very crave for oxygen which we alone have be able to satisfy have send they fly to the window the sidewalk too be litter with man and woman hatless and bonnetless who have rush out of the house many of they have fall in the roadway it be lucky thing that in lord john we have find an expert driver for it be no easy matter to pick one 's way pass through the village or town we could only go at walk pace and once remember opposite the school at tonbridge we have to halt some time while we carry aside the body which block our path few small definite picture stand out in my memory from amid that long panorama of death upon the sussex and kentish high road one be that of great glitter motor car standing outside the inn at the village of southborough it bear as should guess some pleasure party upon their return from brighton or from eastbourne there be three gaily dress woman all young and beautiful one of they with peking spaniel upon her lap with they be rakish look elderly man and young aristocrat his eyeglass still in his eye his cigarette burn down to the stub between the finger of his begloved hand death must have come on they in an instant and fix they as they sit save that the elderly man have at the last moment tear out his collar in an effort to breathe they might all have be asleep on one side of the car waiter with some broken glass beside tray be huddle near the step on the other two very ragged tramp man and woman lie where they have fall the man with his long thin arm still outstretche even as he have ask for alm in his lifetime one instant of time have put aristocrat waiter tramp and dog upon one common footing of inert and dissolve protoplasm remember another singular picture some mile on the london side of sevenoaks there be large convent upon the left with long green slope in front of it upon this slope be assemble great number of school child all kneel at prayer in front of they be fringe of nun and high up the slope face towards they single figure whom we take to be the mother superior unlike the pleasure seeker in the motor car these people seem to have have warning of their danger and to have die beautifully together the teacher and the taught assemble for their last common lesson my mind be still stun by that terrific experience and grope vainly for mean of expression by which can reproduce the emotion which we feel perhaps it be good and wise not to try but merely to indicate the fact even summerlee and challenger be crush and we hear nothing of our companion behind we save an occasional whimper from the lady as to lord john he be too intent upon his wheel and the difficult task of thread his way along such road to have time or inclination for conversation one phrase he use with such wearisome iteration that it stick in my memory and at last almost make i laugh as comment upon the day of doom "pretty doin 's what!"that be his ejaculation as each fresh tremendous combination of death and disaster display itself before we pretty doin 's what he cry as we descend the station hill at rotherfield and it be still pretty doin 's what as we pick our way through wilderness of death in the high street of lewisham and the old kent road it be here that we receive sudden and amazing shock out of the window of humble corner house there appear flutter handkerchief wave at the end of long thin human arm never have the sight of unexpected death cause our heart to stop and then throb so wildly as do this amazing indication of life lord john run the motor to the curb and in an instant we have rush through the open door of the house and up the staircase to the second floor front room from which the signal proceed very old lady sit in chair by the open window and close to she lay across second chair be cylinder of oxygen small but of the same shape as those which have save our own life she turn she thin draw bespectacle face toward we as we crowd in at the doorway "i fear that be abandon here forever say she for be an invalid and can not stir ""well madam challenger answer it be lucky chance that we happen to pass ""i have one all important question to ask you say she gentleman beg that you will be frank with i what effect will these event have upon london and north western railway shares?"we should have laugh have it not be for the tragic eagerness with which she listen for our answer mrs. burston for that be her name be an aged widow whose whole income depend upon small holding of this stock her life have be regulate by the rise and fall of the dividend and she could form no conception of existence save as it be affect by the quotation of her share in vain we point out to she that all the money in the world be her for the taking and be useless when take her old mind would not adapt itself to the new idea and she weep loudly over her vanish stock it be all have she wail if that be go may as well go too "amid her lamentation we find out how this frail old plant have live where the whole great forest have fall she be confirmed invalid and an asthmatic oxygen have be prescribe for her malady and tube be in her room at the moment of the crisis she have naturally inhale some as have be her habit when there be difficulty with her breathing it have give her relief and by dole out her supply she have manage to survive the night finally she have fall asleep and be awaken by the buzz of our motor car as it be impossible to take she on with we we see that she have all necessary of life and promise to communicate with she in couple of day at the late so we leave she still weep bitterly over her vanish stock as we approach the thames the block in the street become thick and the obstacle more bewildering it be with difficulty that we make our way across london bridge the approach to it upon the middlesex side be choke from end to end with frozen traffic which make all furth advance in that direction impossible ship be blaze brightly alongside one of the wharf near the bridge and the air be full of drift smut and of heavy acrid smell of burning there be cloud of dense smoke somewhere near the houses of parliament but it be impossible from where we be to see what be on fire "i do n't know how it strike you lord john remark as he bring his engine to standstill but it seem to i the country be more cheerful than the town dead london be gettin on my nerve be for cast round and then gettin back to rotherfield ""i confes that do not see what we can hope for here say professor summerlee "at the same time say challenger his great voice boom strangely amid the silence it be difficult for we to conceive that out of seven million of people there be only this one old woman who by some peculiarity of constitution or some accident of occupation have manage to survive this catastrophe ""if there should be other how can we hope to find they george ask the lady and yet agree with you that we can not go back until we have try "gette out of the car and leave it by the curb we walk with some difficulty along the crowded pavement of king william street and enter the open door of large insurance office it be corner house and we choose it as command view in every direction ascend the stair we pass through what suppose to have be the board room for eight elderly man be seat round long table in the centre of it the high window be open and we all step out upon the balcony from it we could see the crowded city street radiate in every direction while below we the road be black from side to side with the top of the motionless taxi all or nearly all have their head point outward show how the terrified man of the city have at the last moment make vain endeavor to rejoin their family in the suburb or the country here and there amid the humbler cab tower the great brass spangle motor car of some wealthy magnate wedge hopelessly among the dammed stream of arrest traffic just beneath we there be such one of great size and luxurious appearance with its owner fat old man lean out half his gross body through the window and his podgy hand gleam with diamond outstretche as he urge his chauffeur to make last effort to break through the press dozen motor bus tower up like island in this flood the passenger who crowd the roof lie all huddle together and across each other lap like child 's toy in nursery on broad lamp pedestal in the centre of the roadway burly policeman be stand lean his back against the post in so natural an attitude that it be hard to realize that he be not alive while at his foot there lie ragged newsboy with his bundle of paper on the ground beside he paper cart have got block in the crowd and we could read in large letter black upon yellow scene at lord 's county match interrupted this must have be the early edition for there be other placard bear the legend be it the end great scientist 's warning and another be challenger justified ominous rumours "challenger point the latter placard out to his wife as it thrust itself like banner above the throng could see he throw out his chest and stroke his beard as he look at it it please and flatter that complex mind to think that london have die with his name and his word still present in their thought his feeling be so evident that they arouse the sardonic comment of his colleague "in the limelight to the last challenger he remark "so it would appear he answer complacently well he add as he look down the long vista of the radiating street all silent and all choke up with death really see no purpose to be serve by our staying any long in london suggest that we return at once to rotherfield and then take counsel as to how we shall most profitably employ the year which lie before we "only one other picture shall give of the scene which we carry back in our memory from the dead city it be glimpse which we have of the interior of the old church of st. mary 's which be at the very point where our car be await we pick our way among the prostrate figure upon the step we push open the swing door and enter
